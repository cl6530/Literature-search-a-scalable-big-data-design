        "The studio was filled with the rich odor of roses, and when the\nlight summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came\nthrough the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more\ndelicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.",
        "From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\nlying, smoking, as usual, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton\ncould just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-colored\nblossoms of the laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able\nto bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and\nthen the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge\nwindow, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him\nthink of those pallid jade-faced painters who, in an art that is\nnecessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and\nmotion.  The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through\nthe long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round\nthe black-crocketed spires of the early June hollyhocks, seemed to\nmake the stillness more oppressive, and the dim roar of London was\nlike the bourdon note of a distant organ.",
        "In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many\nstrange conjectures.",
        "As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully\nmirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and\nseemed about to linger there.  But he suddenly started up, and,\nclosing [4] his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he\nsought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he\nfeared he might awake.",
        "“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\"\nsaid Lord Henry, languidly.  “You must certainly send it next year to\nthe Grosvenor.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar.  The\nGrosvenor is the only place.”",
        "“I don’t think I will send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his\nhead back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him\nat Oxford.  “No: I won’t send it anywhere.”",
        "Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement\nthrough the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such\nfanciful whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette.  “Not send it\nanywhere?  My dear fellow, why?  Have you any reason?  What odd chaps\nyou painters are!  You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.\nAs soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.  It is\nsilly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than\nbeing talked about, and that is not being talked about.  A portrait\nlike this would set you far above all the young men in England, and\nmake the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any\nemotion.”",
        "“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t\nexhibit it.  I have put too much of myself into it.”",
        "Lord Henry stretched his long legs out on the divan and shook with\nlaughter.",
        "“Yes, I knew you would laugh; but it is quite true, all the same.”",
        "“Too much of yourself in it!  Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you,\nwith your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made of ivory and rose-leaves.  Why,\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you–well, of course you have\nan intellectual expression, and all that.  But beauty, real beauty,\nends where an intellectual expression begins.  Intellect is in itself\nan exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.  The moment\none sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or\nsomething horrid.  Look at the successful men in any of the learned\nprofessions.  How perfectly hideous they are!  Except, of course, in\nthe Church.  But then in the Church they don’t think.  A bishop keeps\non saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a\nboy of eighteen, and consequently he always looks absolutely\ndelightful.  Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never\ntold me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.  I\nfeel quite sure of that.  He is a brainless, beautiful thing, who\nshould be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at,\nand always here in summer when we want something to chill our\nintelligence.  Don’t flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the\nleast like him.”",
        "“You don’t understand me, Harry.  Of course I am not like him.  I\nknow that perfectly well.  Indeed, I should be sorry to look like\nhim.  You shrug your shoulders?  I am telling you the truth.  There\nis a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the\nsort of fatality that [5] seems to dog through history the faltering\nsteps of kings.  It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.  They can\nsit quietly and gape at the play.  If they know nothing of victory,\nthey are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.  They live as we\nall should live, undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.\nThey neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien\nhands.  Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are,–my\nfame, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks,–we will\nall suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”",
        "“Dorian Gray? is that his name?” said Lord Henry, walking across the\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.",
        "“Yes; that is his name.  I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”",
        "“But why not?”",
        "“Oh, I can’t explain.  When I like people immensely I never tell\ntheir names to any one.  It seems like surrendering a part of them.\nYou know how I love secrecy.  It is the only thing that can make\nmodern life wonderful or mysterious to us.  The commonest thing is\ndelightful if one only hides it.  When I leave town I never tell my\npeople where I am going.  If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.  It\nis a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great\ndeal of romance into one’s life.  I suppose you think me awfully\nfoolish about it?”",
        "“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, laying his hand upon his shoulder;\n\"not at all, my dear Basil.  You seem to forget that I am married,\nand the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception\nnecessary for both parties.  I never know where my wife is, and my\nwife never knows what I am doing.  When we meet,–we do meet\noccasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the duke’s,–\nwe tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious\nfaces.  My wife is very good at it,–much better, in fact, than I am.\nShe never gets confused over her dates, and I always do.  But when\nshe does find me out, she makes no row at all.  I sometimes wish she\nwould; but she merely laughs at me.”",
        "“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\nHallward, shaking his hand off, and strolling towards the door that\nled into the garden.  “I believe that you are really a very good\nhusband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.\nYou are an extraordinary fellow.  You never say a moral thing, and\nyou never do a wrong thing.  Your cynicism is simply a pose.”",
        "“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I\nknow,” cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out\ninto the garden together, and for a time they did not speak.",
        "After a long pause Lord Henry pulled out his watch.  “I am afraid I\nmust be going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go I insist on your\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”",
        "“What is that?” asked Basil Hallward, keeping his eyes fixed on the\nground.",
        "“You know quite well.”",
        "“I do not, Harry.”",
        "[6] “Well, I will tell you what it is.”",
        "“Please don’t.”",
        "“I must.  I want you to explain to me why you won’t exhibit Dorian\nGray’s picture.  I want the real reason.”",
        "“I told you the real reason.”",
        "“No, you did not.  You said it was because there was too much of\nyourself in it.  Now, that is childish.”",
        "“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face,\n\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the\nartist, not of the sitter.  The sitter is merely the accident, the\noccasion.  It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather\nthe painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.  The reason\nI will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown\nwith it the secret of my own soul.”",
        "Lord Harry laughed.  “And what is that?” he asked.",
        "“I will tell you,” said Hallward; and an expression of perplexity\ncame over his face.",
        "“I am all expectation, Basil,” murmured his companion, looking at\nhim.",
        "“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the young\npainter; “and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.  Perhaps you\nwill hardly believe it.”",
        "Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy\nfrom the grass, and examined it.  “I am quite sure I shall understand\nit,” he replied, gazing intently at the little golden white-feathered\ndisk, “and I can believe anything, provided that it is incredible.”",
        "The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac\nblooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid\nair.  A grasshopper began to chirrup in the grass, and a long thin\ndragon-fly floated by on its brown gauze wings.  Lord Henry felt as\nif he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating, and he wondered what\nwas coming.",
        "“Well, this is incredible,” repeated Hallward, rather bitterly,–\n\"incredible to me at times.  I don’t know what it means.  The story\nis simply this.  Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s.\nYou know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society from time\nto time, just to remind the public that we are not savages.  With an\nevening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a\nstock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.  Well, after\nI had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed\ndowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became conscious that\nsome one was looking at me.  I turned half-way round, and saw Dorian\nGray for the first time.  When our eyes met, I felt that I was\ngrowing pale.  A curious instinct of terror came over me.  I knew\nthat I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was\nso fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my\nwhole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.  I did not want any\nexternal influence in my life.  You know yourself, Harry, how\nindependent I am by nature.  My father destined me for the army.  I\ninsisted on [7] going to Oxford.  Then he made me enter my name at\nthe Middle Temple.  Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up\nthe Bar, and announced my intention of becoming a painter.  I have\nalways been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met\nDorian Gray.  Then–But I don’t know how to explain it to you.\nSomething seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible\ncrisis in my life.  I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store\nfor me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows.  I knew that if I spoke\nto Dorian I would become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought\nnot to speak to him.  I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room.  It\nwas not conscience that made me do so: it was cowardice.  I take no\ncredit to myself for trying to escape.”",
        "“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.\nConscience is the trade-name of the firm.  That is all.”",
        "“I don’t believe that, Harry.  However, whatever was my motive,– and\nit may have been pride, for I used to be very proud,–I certainly\nstruggled to the door.  There, of course, I stumbled against Lady\nBrandon.  ’You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?’ she\nscreamed out.  You know her shrill horrid voice?”",
        "“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\npulling the daisy to bits with his long, nervous fingers.",
        "“I could not get rid of her.  She brought me up to Royalties, and\npeople with Stars and Garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic\ntiaras and hooked noses.  She spoke of me as her dearest friend.  I\nhad only met her once before, but she took it into her head to\nlionize me.  I believe some picture of mine had made a great success\nat the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny\nnewspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.\nSuddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose\npersonality had so strangely stirred me.  We were quite close, almost\ntouching.  Our eyes met again.  It was mad of me, but I asked Lady\nBrandon to introduce me to him.  Perhaps it was not so mad, after\nall.  It was simply inevitable.  We would have spoken to each other\nwithout any introduction.  I am sure of that.  Dorian told me so\nafterwards.  He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other.”",
        "“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?  I know\nshe goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests.  I remember\nher bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old gentleman\ncovered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in\na tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody\nin the room, something like ’Sir Humpty Dumpty–you know–Afghan\nfrontier–Russian intrigues: very successful man–wife killed by an\nelephant–quite inconsolable–wants to marry a beautiful American\nwidow–everybody does nowadays–hates Mr. Gladstone–but very much\ninterested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of Schouvaloff.’  I\nsimply fled.  I like to find out people for myself.  But poor Lady\nBrandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.\nShe either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about\nthem except what one wants to know.  But what did she say about Mr.\nDorian Gray?”",
        "[8] “Oh, she murmured, ’Charming boy–poor dear mother and I quite\ninseparable–engaged to be married to the same man–I mean married on\nthe same day–how very silly of me!  Quite forget what he does–\nafraid he–doesn’t do anything–oh, yes, plays the piano–or is it\nthe violin, dear Mr. Gray?’  We could neither of us help laughing,\nand we became friends at once.”",
        "“Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best\nending for one,” said Lord Henry, plucking another daisy.",
        "Hallward buried his face in his hands.  “You don’t understand what\nfriendship is, Harry,” he murmured,–\"or what enmity is, for that\nmatter.  You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to\nevery one.”",
        "“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back,\nand looking up at the little clouds that were drifting across the\nhollowed turquoise of the summer sky, like ravelled skeins of glossy\nwhite silk.  “Yes; horribly unjust of you.  I make a great difference\nbetween people.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my\nacquaintances for their characters, and my enemies for their brains.\nA man can’t be too careful in the choice of his enemies.  I have not\ngot one who is a fool.  They are all men of some intellectual power,\nand consequently they all appreciate me.  Is that very vain of me?  I\nthink it is rather vain.”",
        "“I should think it was, Harry.  But according to your category I must\nbe merely an acquaintance.”",
        "“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”",
        "“And much less than a friend.  A sort of brother, I suppose?”",
        "“Oh, brothers!  I don’t care for brothers.  My elder brother won’t\ndie, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”",
        "“Harry!”",
        "“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.  But I can’t help detesting\nmy relations.  I suppose it comes from the fact that we can’t stand\nother people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the\nvices of the upper classes.  They feel that drunkenness, stupidity,\nand immorality should be their own special property, and that if any\none of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves.\nWhen poor Southwark got into the Divorce Court, their indignation was\nquite magnificent.  And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\nlower orders live correctly.”",
        "“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\nmore, Harry, I don’t believe you do either.”",
        "Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard, and tapped the toe of his\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled malacca cane.  “How English you\nare, Basil!  If one puts forward an idea to a real Englishman,–\nalways a rash thing to do,–he never dreams of considering whether\nthe idea is right or wrong.  The only thing he considers of any\nimportance is whether one believes it one’s self.  Now, the value of\nan idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man\nwho expresses it.  Indeed, the probabilities are that the more\ninsincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be,\nas in that case it [9] will not be colored by either his wants, his\ndesires, or his prejudices.  However, I don’t propose to discuss\npolitics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.  I like persons better\nthan principles.  Tell me more about Dorian Gray.  How often do you\nsee him?”",
        "“Every day.  I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day.  Of\ncourse sometimes it is only for a few minutes.  But a few minutes\nwith somebody one worships mean a great deal.”",
        "“But you don’t really worship him?”",
        "“I do.”",
        "“How extraordinary!  I thought you would never care for anything but\nyour painting,–your art, I should say.  Art sounds better, doesn’t\nit?”",
        "“He is all my art to me now.  I sometimes think, Harry, that there\nare only two eras of any importance in the history of the world.  The\nfirst is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is\nthe appearance of a new personality for art also.  What the invention\nof oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinoüs was to\nlate Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to\nme.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, model\nfrom him.  Of course I have done all that.  He has stood as Paris in\ndainty armor, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-\nspear.  Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms, he has sat on the prow of\nAdrian’s barge, looking into the green, turbid Nile.  He has leaned\nover the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water’s\nsilent silver the wonder of his own beauty.  But he is much more to\nme than that.  I won’t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I\nhave done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express\nit.  There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the\nwork I have done since I met Dorian Gray is good work, is the best\nwork of my life.  But in some curious way–I wonder will you\nunderstand me?–his personality has suggested to me an entirely new\nmanner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see things\ndifferently, I think of them differently.  I can now re-create life\nin a way that was hidden from me before.  ’A dream of form in days of\nthought,’–who is it who says that?  I forget; but it is what Dorian\nGray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad, –for\nhe seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over\ntwenty,–his merely visible presence,–ah!  I wonder can you realize\nall that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a\nfresh school, a school that is to have in itself all the passion of\nthe romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.\nThe harmony of soul and body,–how much that is!  We in our madness\nhave separated the two, and have invented a realism that is bestial,\nan ideality that is void.  Harry!  Harry! if you only knew what\nDorian Gray is to me!  You remember that landscape of mine, for which\nAgnew offered me such a huge price, but which I would not part with?\nIt is one of the best things I have ever done.  And why is it so?\nBecause, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.”",
        "“Basil, this is quite wonderful!  I must see Dorian Gray.”  Hallward\ngot up from the seat, and walked up and down the [10] garden.  After\nsome time he came back.  “You don’t understand, Harry,” he said.\n\"Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art.  He is never more\npresent in my work than when no image of him is there.  He is simply\na suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.  I see him in the\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and the subtleties of\ncertain colors.  That is all.”",
        "“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?”",
        "“Because I have put into it all the extraordinary romance of which,\nof course, I have never dared to speak to him.  He knows nothing\nabout it.  He will never know anything about it.  But the world might\nguess it; and I will not bare my soul to their shallow, prying eyes.\nMy heart shall never be put under their microscope.  There is too\nmuch of myself in the thing, Harry,–too much of myself!”",
        "“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.  They know how useful\npassion is for publication.  Nowadays a broken heart will run to many\neditions.”",
        "“I hate them for it.  An artist should create beautiful things, but\nshould put nothing of his own life into them.  We live in an age when\nmen treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.  We\nhave lost the abstract sense of beauty.  If I live, I will show the\nworld what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my\nportrait of Dorian Gray.”",
        "“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you.  It is\nonly the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Tell me, is Dorian Gray\nvery fond of you?”",
        "Hallward considered for a few moments.  “He likes me,” he answered,\nafter a pause; “I know he likes me.  Of course I flatter him\ndreadfully.  I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I\nknow I shall be sorry for having said.  I give myself away.  As a\nrule, he is charming to me, and we walk home together from the club\narm in arm, or sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.  Now\nand then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a\nreal delight in giving me pain.  Then I feel, Harry, that I have\ngiven away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a\nflower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity,\nan ornament for a summer’s day.”",
        "“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger.  Perhaps you will tire\nsooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no\ndoubt that Genius lasts longer than Beauty.  That accounts for the\nfact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.  In the\nwild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures,\nand so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of\nkeeping our place.  The thoroughly well informed man,–that is the\nmodern ideal.  And the mind of the thoroughly well informed man is a\ndreadful thing.  It is like a bric-à-brac shop, all monsters and\ndust, and everything priced above its proper value.  I think you will\ntire first, all the same.  Some day you will look at Gray, and he\nwill seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won’t like his\ntone of color, or something.  You will bitterly reproach him in your\nown heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you.\nThe next time he calls, you will be [11] perfectly cold and\nindifferent.  It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.  The\nworst of having a romance is that it leaves one so unromantic.”",
        "“Harry, don’t talk like that.  As long as I live, the personality of\nDorian Gray will dominate me.  You can’t feel what I feel.  You\nchange too often.”",
        "“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.  Those who are\nfaithful know only the pleasures of love: it is the faithless who\nknow love’s tragedies.”  And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\nsilver case, and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\nself-satisfied air, as if he had summed up life in a phrase.  There\nwas a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the ivy, and the blue cloud-\nshadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.  How\npleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other people’s\nemotions were!–much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to\nhim.  One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends,–those were\nthe fascinating things in life.  He thought with pleasure of the\ntedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil\nHallward.  Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure to meet\nLord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about\nthe housing of the poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses.\nIt was charming to have escaped all that!  As he thought of his aunt,\nan idea seemed to strike him.  He turned to Hallward, and said, “My\ndear fellow, I have just remembered.”",
        "“Remembered what, Harry?”",
        "“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”",
        "“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.",
        "“Don’t look so angry, Basil.  It was at my aunt’s, Lady Agatha’s.\nShe told me she had discovered a wonderful young man, who was going\nto help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.  I am\nbound to state that she never told me he was good-looking.  Women\nhave no appreciation of good looks.  At least, good women have not.\nShe said that he was very earnest, and had a beautiful nature.  I at\nonce pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair,\nhorridly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.  I wish I had\nknown it was your friend.”",
        "“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“I don’t want you to meet him.”",
        "“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\nthe garden.",
        "“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.",
        "Basil Hallward turned to the servant, who stood blinking in the\nsunlight.  “Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I will be in in a few\nmoments.”  The man bowed, and went up the walk.",
        "Then he looked at Lord Henry.  “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\nsaid.  “He has a simple and a beautiful nature.  Your aunt was quite\nright in what she said of him.  Don’t spoil him for me.  Don’t try to\ninfluence him.  Your influence would be bad.  The world is wide, and\nhas many marvellous people in it.  Don’t take [12] away from me the\none person that makes life absolutely lovely to me, and that gives to\nmy art whatever wonder or charm it possesses.  Mind, Harry, I trust\nyou.”  He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him\nalmost against his will.",
        "“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and, taking\nHallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.",
        "As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.  He was seated at the\npiano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of\nSchumann’s “Forest Scenes.”  “You must lend me these, Basil,” he\ncried.  “I want to learn them.  They are perfectly charming.”",
        "“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”",
        "“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\nmyself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool, in a\nwilful, petulant manner.  When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\nblush colored his cheeks for a moment, and he started up.  “I beg\nyour pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”",
        "“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.  I\nhave just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now\nyou have spoiled everything.”",
        "“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said\nLord Henry, stepping forward and shaking him by the hand.  “My aunt\nhas often spoken to me about you.  You are one of her favorites, and,\nI am afraid, one of her victims also.”",
        "“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian, with\na funny look of penitence.  “I promised to go to her club in\nWhitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.\nWe were to have played a duet together,–three duets, I believe.  I\ndon’t know what she will say to me.  I am far too frightened to\ncall.”",
        "“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt.  She is quite devoted to\nyou.  And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there.\nThe audience probably thought it was a duet.  When Aunt Agatha sits\ndown to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people.”",
        "“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered\nDorian, laughing.",
        "Lord Henry looked at him.  Yes, he was certainly wonderfully\nhandsome, with his finely-curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes,\nhis crisp gold hair.  There was something in his face that made one\ntrust him at once.  All the candor of youth was there, as well as all\nyouth’s passionate purity.  One felt that he had kept himself\nunspotted from the world.  No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\nHe was made to be worshipped.",
        "“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray,–far too\ncharming.”  And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan, and\nopened his cigarette-case.",
        "Hallward had been busy mixing his colors and getting his brushes\nready.  He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\n[13] remark he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\n\"Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day.  Would you think it\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”",
        "Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian Gray.  “Am I to go, Mr.\nGray?” he asked.",
        "“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry.  I see that Basil is in one of his\nsulky moods; and I can’t bear him when he sulks.  Besides, I want you\nto tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”",
        "“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.  But I certainly\nwill not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.  You don’t\nreally mind, Basil, do you?  You have often told me that you liked\nyour sitters to have some one to chat to.”",
        "Hallward bit his lip.  “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”",
        "Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves.  “You are very pressing,\nBasil, but I am afraid I must go.  I have promised to meet a man at\nthe Orleans.–Good-by, Mr.  Gray.  Come and see me some afternoon in\nCurzon Street.  I am nearly always at home at five o’clock.  Write to\nme when you are coming.  I should be sorry to miss you.”",
        "“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry goes I shall go too.  You\nnever open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull\nstanding on a platform and trying to look pleasant.  Ask him to stay.\nI insist upon it.”",
        "“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\ngazing intently at his picture.  “It is quite true, I never talk when\nI am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully\ntedious for my unfortunate sitters.  I beg you to stay.”",
        "“But what about my man at the Orleans?”",
        "Hallward laughed.  “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\nthat.  Sit down again, Harry.–And now, Dorian, get up on the\nplatform, and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what\nLord Henry says.  He has a very bad influence over all his friends,\nwith the exception of myself.”",
        "Dorian stepped up on the dais, with the air of a young Greek martyr,\nand made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had\nrather taken a fancy.  He was so unlike Hallward.  They made a\ndelightful contrast.  And he had such a beautiful voice.  After a few\nmoments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\nHenry?  As bad as Basil says?”",
        "“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.  All influence\nis immoral,–immoral from the scientific point of view.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul.  He\ndoes not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural\npassions.  His virtues are not real to him.  His sins, if there are\nsuch things as sins, are borrowed.  He becomes an echo of some one\nelse’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.\nThe aim of life is self-development.  To realize one’s nature\nperfectly,–that is what each of us is here for.  People are afraid\nof themselves, nowadays.  They have forgotten the highest of all\nduties, the duty that one owes to one’s [14] self.  Of course they\nare charitable.  They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar.  But\ntheir own souls starve, and are naked.  Courage has gone out of our\nrace.  Perhaps we never really had it.  The terror of society, which\nis the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\nreligion,–these are the two things that govern us.  And yet–”",
        "“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\nboy,” said Hallward, deep in his work, and conscious only that a look\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.",
        "“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\nthat graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\nhim, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one\nman were to live his life out fully and completely, were to give form\nto every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every\ndream,–I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of\njoy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return\nto the Hellenic ideal,– to something finer, richer, than the\nHellenic ideal, it may be.  But the bravest man among us is afraid of\nhimself.  The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the\nself-denial that mars our lives.  We are punished for our refusals.\nEvery impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and\npoisons us.  The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for\naction is a mode of purification.  Nothing remains then but the\nrecollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.  The only way\nto get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.  Resist it, and your\nsoul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to\nitself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous\nand unlawful.  It has been said that the great events of the world\ntake place in the brain.  It is in the brain, and the brain only,\nthat the great sins of the world take place also.  You, Mr. Gray, you\nyourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you\nhave had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have\nfilled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere\nmemory might stain your cheek with shame–”",
        "“Stop!” murmured Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me.  I don’t know\nwhat to say.  There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.\nDon’t speak.  Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think.”",
        "For nearly ten minutes he stood there motionless, with parted lips,\nand eyes strangely bright.  He was dimly conscious that entirely\nfresh impulses were at work within him, and they seemed to him to\nhave come really from himself.  The few words that Basil’s friend had\nsaid to him–words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful\nparadox in them–had yet touched some secret chord, that had never\nbeen touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing\nto curious pulses.",
        "Music had stirred him like that.  Music had troubled him many times.\nBut music was not articulate.  It was not a new world, but rather a\nnew chaos, that it created in us.  Words!  Mere words!  How terrible\nthey were!  How clear, and vivid, and cruel!  One could not escape\nfrom them.  And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! [15] They\nseemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to\nhave a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.  Mere\nwords!  Was there anything so real as words?",
        "Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\nHe understood them now.  Life suddenly became fiery-colored to him.\nIt seemed to him that he had been walking in fire.  Why had he not\nknown it?",
        "Lord Henry watched him, with his sad smile.  He knew the precise\npsychological moment when to say nothing.  He felt intensely\ninterested.  He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words\nhad produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was\nsixteen, which had revealed to him much that he had not known before,\nhe wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through the same\nexperience.  He had merely shot an arrow into the air.  Had it hit\nthe mark?  How fascinating the lad was!",
        "Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that\nhad the true refinement and perfect delicacy that come only from\nstrength.  He was unconscious of the silence.",
        "“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray, suddenly.  “I\nmust go out and sit in the garden.  The air is stifling here.”",
        "“My dear fellow, I am so sorry.  When I am painting, I can’t think of\nanything else.  But you never sat better.  You were perfectly still.\nAnd I have caught the effect I wanted,–the half-parted lips, and the\nbright look in the eyes.  I don’t know what Harry has been saying to\nyou, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful\nexpression.  I suppose he has been paying you compliments.  You\nmustn’t believe a word that he says.”",
        "“He has certainly not been paying me compliments.  Perhaps that is\nthe reason I don’t think I believe anything he has told me.”",
        "“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with\nhis dreamy, heavy-lidded eyes.  “I will go out to the garden with\nyou.  It is horridly hot in the studio.–Basil, let us have something\niced to drink, something with strawberries in it.”",
        "“Certainly, Harry.  Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\ntell him what you want.  I have got to work up this background, so I\nwill join you later on.  Don’t keep Dorian too long.  I have never\nbeen in better form for painting than I am to-day.  This is going to\nbe my masterpiece.  It is my masterpiece as it stands.”",
        "Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray burying his\nface in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\nperfume as if it had been wine.  He came close to him, and put his\nhand upon his shoulder.  “You are quite right to do that,” he\nmurmured.  “Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing\ncan cure the senses but the soul.”",
        "The lad started and drew back.  He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\ntossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads.\nThere was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they\nare suddenly awakened.  His finely-chiselled nostrils quivered, and\nsome hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them\ntrembling.",
        "[16] “Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets\nof life,– to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by\nmeans of the soul.  You are a wonderful creature.  You know more than\nyou think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”",
        "Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.  He could not help\nliking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him.  His\nromantic olive-colored face and worn expression interested him.\nThere was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely\nfascinating.  His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious\ncharm.  They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a\nlanguage of their own.  But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of\nbeing afraid.  Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to\nhimself?  He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship\nbetween then had never altered him.  Suddenly there had come some one\nacross his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery.\nAnd, yet, what was there to be afraid of?  He was not a school-boy,\nor a girl.  It was absurd to be frightened.",
        "“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry.  “Parker has\nbrought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare you\nwill be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.  You\nreally must not let yourself become sunburnt.  It would be very\nunbecoming to you.”",
        "“What does it matter?” cried Dorian, laughing, as he sat down on the\nseat at the end of the garden.",
        "“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because you have now the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one\nthing worth having.”",
        "“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”",
        "“No, you don’t feel it now.  Some day, when you are old and wrinkled\nand ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and\npassion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it,\nyou will feel it terribly.  Now, wherever you go, you charm the\nworld.  Will it always be so?",
        "“You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.  Don’t frown.  You\nhave.  And Beauty is a form of Genius,–is higher, indeed, than\nGenius, as it needs no explanation.  It is one of the great facts of\nthe world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark\nwaters of that silver shell we call the moon.  It cannot be\nquestioned.  It has its divine right of sovereignty.  It makes\nprinces of those who have it.  You smile?  Ah! when you have lost it\nyou won’t smile.",
        "“People say sometimes that Beauty is only superficial.  That may be\nso.  But at least it is not so superficial as Thought.  To me, Beauty\nis the wonder of wonders.  It is only shallow people who do not judge\nby appearances.  The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\nthe invisible.",
        "“Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you.  But what the gods\ngive they quickly take away.  You have only a few years in which\nreally to live.  When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it,\nand then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left\n[17] for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs\nthat the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.\nEvery month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful.\nTime is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.\nYou will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.  You will\nsuffer horribly.",
        "“Realize your youth while you have it.  Don’t squander the gold of\nyour days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless\nfailure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and\nthe vulgar, which are the aims, the false ideals, of our age.  Live!\nLive the wonderful life that is in you!  Let nothing be lost upon\nyou.  Be always searching for new sensations.  Be afraid of nothing.",
        "“A new hedonism,–that is what our century wants.  You might be its\nvisible symbol.  With your personality there is nothing you could not\ndo.  The world belongs to you for a season.",
        "“The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what\nyou really are, what you really might be.  There was so much about\nyou that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about\nyourself.  I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.  For\nthere is such a little time that your youth will last,–such a little\ntime.",
        "“The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.  The\nlaburnum will be as golden next June as it is now.  In a month there\nwill be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green\nnight of its leaves will have its purple stars.  But we never get\nback our youth.  The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes\nsluggish.  Our limbs fail, our senses rot.  We degenerate into\nhideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we\nwere too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we did not\ndare to yield to.  Youth!  Youth!  There is absolutely nothing in the\nworld but youth!”",
        "Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.  The spray of lilac\nfell from his hand upon the gravel.  A furry bee came and buzzed\nround it for a moment.  Then it began to scramble all over the\nfretted purple of the tiny blossoms.  He watched it with that strange\ninterest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high\nimport make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion,\nfor which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that\nterrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.\nAfter a time it flew away.  He saw it creeping into the stained\ntrumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus.  The flower seemed to quiver, and\nthen swayed gently to and fro.",
        "Suddenly Hallward appeared at the door of the studio, and made\nfrantic signs for them to come in.  They turned to each other, and\nsmiled.",
        "“I am waiting,” cried Hallward.  “Do come in.  The light is quite\nperfect, and you can bring your drinks.”",
        "They rose up, and sauntered down the walk together.  Two green-and-\nwhite butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the\nend of the garden a thrush began to sing.",
        "“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\nhim.",
        "“Yes, I am glad now.  I wonder shall I always be glad?”",
        "[18] “Always!  That is a dreadful word.  It makes me shudder when I\nhear it.  Women are so fond of using it.  They spoil every romance by\ntrying to make it last forever.  It is a meaningless word, too.  The\nonly difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the\ncaprice lasts a little longer.”",
        "As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord\nHenry’s arm.  “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he\nmurmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped upon the\nplatform and resumed his pose.",
        "Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair, and watched\nhim.  The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only\nsound that broke the stillness, except when Hallward stepped back now\nand then to look at his work from a distance.  In the slanting beams\nthat streamed through the open door-way the dust danced and was\ngolden.  The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over\neverything.",
        "After about a quarter of an hour, Hallward stopped painting, looked\nfor a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the\npicture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes, and smiling.  “It\nis quite finished,” he cried, at last, and stooping down he wrote his\nname in thin vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.",
        "Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.  It was certainly a\nwonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.",
        "“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said.–\"Mr.\nGray, come and look at yourself.”",
        "The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.  “Is it really\nfinished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.",
        "“Quite finished,” said Hallward.  “And you have sat splendidly to-\nday.  I am awfully obliged to you.”",
        "“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry.  “Isn’t it, Mr.\nGray?”",
        "Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\nand turned towards it.  When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\nflushed for a moment with pleasure.  A look of joy came into his\neyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.  He stood\nthere motionless, and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was\nspeaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words.  The\nsense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation.  He had never\nfelt it before.  Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be\nmerely the charming exaggerations of friendship.  He had listened to\nthem, laughed at them, forgotten them.  They had not influenced his\nnature.  Then had come Lord Henry, with his strange panegyric on\nyouth, his terrible warning of its brevity.  That had stirred him at\nthe time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own\nloveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him.\nYes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen,\nhis eyes dim and colorless, the grace of his figure broken and\ndeformed.  The scarlet would pass away from his lips, and the gold\nsteal from his hair.  The life that was to make his soul would mar\nhis body.  He would become ignoble, hideous, and uncouth.",
        "[19] As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck like a knife\nacross him, and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver.  His\neyes deepened into amethyst, and a mist of tears came across them.\nHe felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.",
        "“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\nlad’s silence, and not understanding what it meant.",
        "“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry.  “Who wouldn’t like it?  It\nis one of the greatest things in modern art.  I will give you\nanything you like to ask for it.  I must have it.”",
        "“It is not my property, Harry.”",
        "“Whose property is it?”",
        "“Dorian’s, of course.”",
        "“He is a very lucky fellow.”",
        "“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray, with his eyes still fixed upon\nhis own portrait.  “How sad it is!  I shall grow old, and horrid, and\ndreadful.  But this picture will remain always young.  It will never\nbe older than this particular day of June. . . . If it was only the\nother way!  If it was I who were to be always young, and the picture\nthat were to grow old!  For this–for this–I would give everything!\nYes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!”",
        "“You would hardly care for that arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\nHenry, laughing.  “It would be rather hard lines on you.”",
        "“I should object very strongly, Harry.”",
        "Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.  “I believe you would, Basil.\nYou like your art better than your friends.  I am no more to you than\na green bronze figure.  Hardly as much, I dare say.”",
        "Hallward stared in amazement.  It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\nthat.  What had happened?  He seemed almost angry.  His face was\nflushed and his cheeks burning.",
        "“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\nsilver Faun.  You will like them always.  How long will you like me?\nTill I have my first wrinkle, I suppose.  I know, now, that when one\nloses one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything.\nYour picture has taught me that.  Lord Henry is perfectly right.\nYouth is the only thing worth having.  When I find that I am growing\nold, I will kill myself.”",
        "Hallward turned pale, and caught his hand.  “Dorian!  Dorian!” he\ncried, “don’t talk like that.  I have never had such a friend as you,\nand I shall never have such another.  You are not jealous of material\nthings, are you?”",
        "“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.  I am jealous\nof the portrait you have painted of me.  Why should it keep what I\nmust lose?  Every moment that passes takes something from me, and\ngives something to it.  Oh, if it was only the other way!  If the\npicture could change, and I could be always what I am now!  Why did\nyou paint it?  It will mock me some day,–mock me horribly!”  The hot\ntears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging\nhimself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as if he\nwas praying.",
        "“This is your doing, Harry,” said Hallward, bitterly.",
        "[20] “My doing?”",
        "“Yes, yours, and you know it.”",
        "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  “It is the real Dorian Gray,–\nthat is all,” he answered.",
        "“It is not.”",
        "“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”",
        "“You should have gone away when I asked you.”",
        "“I stayed when you asked me.”",
        "“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\nyou both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\ndone, and I will destroy it.  What is it but canvas and color?  I\nwill not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”",
        "Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and looked at him\nwith pallid face and tear-stained eyes, as he walked over to the deal\npainting-table that was set beneath the large curtained window.  What\nwas he doing there?  His fingers were straying about among the litter\nof tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something.  Yes, it was the\nlong palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel.  He had found\nit at last.  He was going to rip up the canvas.",
        "With a stifled sob he leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\nHallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\nthe studio.  “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried.  “It would be murder!”",
        "“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said Hallward,\ncoldly, when he had recovered from his surprise.  “I never thought\nyou would.”",
        "“Appreciate it?  I am in love with it, Basil.  It is part of myself,\nI feel that.”",
        "“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed,\nand sent home.  Then you can do what you like with yourself.”  And he\nwalked across the room and rang the bell for tea.  “You will have\ntea, of course, Dorian?  And so will you, Harry?  Tea is the only\nsimple pleasure left to us.”",
        "“I don’t like simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry.  “And I don’t like\nscenes, except on the stage.  What absurd fellows you are, both of\nyou!  I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal.  It was\nthe most premature definition ever given.  Man is many things, but he\nis not rational.  I am glad he is not, after all: though I wish you\nchaps would not squabble over the picture.  You had much better let\nme have it, Basil.  This silly boy doesn’t really want it, and I do.”",
        "“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I will never forgive you!\"\ncried Dorian Gray.  “And I don’t allow people to call me a silly\nboy.”",
        "“You know the picture is yours, Dorian.  I gave it to you before it\nexisted.”",
        "“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\ndon’t really mind being called a boy.”",
        "“I should have minded very much this morning, Lord Henry.”",
        "“Ah! this morning!  You have lived since then.”",
        "There came a knock to the door, and the butler entered with the tea-\ntray and set it down upon a small Japanese table.  There was a [21]\nrattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\nTwo globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page.  Dorian Gray\nwent over and poured the tea out.  The two men sauntered languidly to\nthe table, and examined what was under the covers.",
        "“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry.  “There is sure\nto be something on, somewhere.  I have promised to dine at White’s,\nbut it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire and say\nthat I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a\nsubsequent engagement.  I think that would be a rather nice excuse:\nit would have the surprise of candor.”",
        "“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered\nHallward.  “And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”",
        "“Yes,” answered Lord Henry, dreamily, “the costume of our day is\ndetestable.  It is so sombre, so depressing.  Sin is the only color-\nelement left in modern life.”",
        "“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”",
        "“Before which Dorian?  The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the\none in the picture?”",
        "“Before either.”",
        "“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the\nlad.",
        "“Then you shall come; and you will come too, Basil, won’t you?”",
        "“I can’t, really.  I would sooner not.  I have a lot of work to do.”",
        "“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”",
        "“I should like that awfully.”",
        "Basil Hallward bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the\npicture.  “I will stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.",
        "“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, running\nacross to him.  “Am I really like that?”",
        "“Yes; you are just like that.”",
        "“How wonderful, Basil!”",
        "“At least you are like it in appearance.  But it will never alter,\"\nsaid Hallward.  “That is something.”",
        "“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” murmured Lord Henry.",
        "“And, after all, it is purely a question for physiology.  It has\nnothing to do with our own will.  It is either an unfortunate\naccident, or an unpleasant result of temperament.  Young men want to\nbe faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot:\nthat is all one can say.”",
        "“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward.  “Stop and\ndine with me.”",
        "“I can’t, really.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because I have promised Lord Henry to go with him.”",
        "“He won’t like you better for keeping your promises.  He always\nbreaks his own.  I beg you not to go.”",
        "Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.",
        "“I entreat you.”",
        "The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching\nthem from the tea-table with an amused smile.",
        "[22] “I must go, Basil,” he answered.",
        "“Very well,” said Hallward; and he walked over and laid his cup down\non the tray.  “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had\nbetter lose no time.  Good-by, Harry; good-by, Dorian.  Come and see\nme soon.  Come to-morrow.”",
        "“Certainly.”",
        "“You won’t forget?”",
        "“No, of course not.”",
        "“And . . . Harry!”",
        "“Yes, Basil?”",
        "“Remember what I asked you, when in the garden this morning.”",
        "“I have forgotten it.”",
        "“I trust you.”",
        "“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing.–\"Come, Mr.\nGray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.–\nGood-by, Basil.  It has been a most interesting afternoon.”",
        "As the door closed behind them, Hallward flung himself down on a\nsofa, and a look of pain came into his face.",
        "One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a\nluxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in\nCurzon Street.  It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its\nhigh panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-colored\nfrieze and ceiling of raised plaster-work, and its brick-dust felt\ncarpet strewn with long-fringed silk Persian rugs.  On a tiny\nsatinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a\ncopy of “Les Cent Nouvelles,” bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis\nEve, and powdered with the gilt daisies that the queen had selected\nfor her device.  Some large blue china jars, filled with parrot-\ntulips, were ranged on the mantel-shelf, and through the small leaded\npanes of the window streamed the apricot-colored light of a summer’s\nday in London.",
        "Lord Henry had not come in yet.  He was always late on principle, his\nprinciple being that punctuality is the thief of time.  So the lad\nwas looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the\npages of an elaborately-illustrated edition of “Manon Lescaut” that\nhe had found in one of the bookcases.  The formal monotonous ticking\nof the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him.  Once or twice he thought of\ngoing away.",
        "At last he heard a light step outside, and the door opened.  “How\nlate you are, Harry!” he murmured.",
        "“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” said a woman’s voice.",
        "He glanced quickly round, and rose to his feet.  “I beg your pardon.\nI thought–”",
        "“You thought it was my husband.  It is only his wife.  You must let\nme introduce myself.  I know you quite well by your photographs.  I\nthink my husband has got twenty-seven of them.”",
        "[23] “Not twenty-seven, Lady Henry?”",
        "“Well, twenty-six, then.  And I saw you with him the other night at\nthe Opera.”  She laughed nervously, as she spoke, and watched him\nwith her vague forget-me-not eyes.  She was a curious woman, whose\ndresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put\non in a tempest.  She was always in love with somebody, and, as her\npassion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.  She\ntried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy.  Her\nname was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.",
        "“That was at ’Lohengrin,’ Lady Henry, I think?”",
        "“Yes; it was at dear ’Lohengrin.’  I like Wagner’s music better than\nany other music.  It is so loud that one can talk the whole time,\nwithout people hearing what one says.  That is a great advantage:\ndon’t you think so, Mr. Gray?”",
        "The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her\nfingers began to play with a long paper-knife.",
        "Dorian smiled, and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so,\nLady Henry.  I never talk during music,–at least during good music.\nIf one hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it by\nconversation.”",
        "“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray?  But you must\nnot think I don’t like good music.  I adore it, but I am afraid of\nit.  It makes me too romantic.  I have simply worshipped pianists,–\ntwo at a time, sometimes.  I don’t know what it is about them.\nPerhaps it is that they are foreigners.  They all are, aren’t they?\nEven those that are born in England become foreigners after a time,\ndon’t they?  It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art.\nMakes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it?  You have never been to any\nof my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?  You must come.  I can’t afford\norchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners.  They make one’s rooms\nlook so picturesque.  But here is Harry!–Harry, I came in to look\nfor you, to ask you something,–I forget what it was,–and I found\nMr. Gray here.  We have had such a pleasant chat about music.  We\nhave quite the same views.  No; I think our views are quite\ndifferent.  But he has been most pleasant.  I am so glad I’ve seen\nhim.”",
        "“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating\nhis dark crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an\namused smile.–\"So sorry I am late, Dorian.  I went to look after a\npiece of old brocade in Wardour Street, and had to bargain for hours\nfor it.  Nowadays people know the price of everything, and the value\nof nothing.”",
        "“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, after an awkward\nsilence, with her silly sudden laugh.  “I have promised to drive with\nthe duchess.–Good-by, Mr. Gray.–Good-by, Harry.  You are dining\nout, I suppose?  So am I.  Perhaps I shall see you at Lady\nThornbury’s.”",
        "“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her,\nas she flitted out of the room, looking like a bird-of-paradise that\nhad been out in the rain, and leaving a faint odor of patchouli\nbehind her.  Then he shook hands with Dorian Gray, lit a cigarette,\nand flung himself down on the sofa.",
        "[24] “Never marry a woman with straw-colored hair, Dorian,” he said,\nafter a few puffs.",
        "“Why, Harry?”",
        "“Because they are so sentimental.”",
        "“But I like sentimental people.”",
        "“Never marry at all, Dorian.  Men marry because they are tired;\nwomen, because they are curious: both are disappointed.”",
        "“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry.  I am too much in love.\nThat is one of your aphorisms.  I am putting it into practice, as I\ndo everything you say.”",
        "“Whom are you in love with?” said Lord Henry, looking at him with a\ncurious smile.",
        "“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.",
        "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  “That is a rather common-place\ndébut,” he murmured.",
        "“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”",
        "“Who is she?”",
        "“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”",
        "“Never heard of her.”",
        "“No one has.  People will some day, however.  She is a genius.”",
        "“My dear boy, no woman is a genius: women are a decorative sex.  They\nnever have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.  They\nrepresent the triumph of matter over mind, just as we men represent\nthe triumph of mind over morals.  There are only two kinds of women,\nthe plain and the colored.  The plain women are very useful.  If you\nwant to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take\nthem down to supper.  The other women are very charming.  They commit\none mistake, however.  They paint in order to try to look young.  Our\ngrandmothers painted in order to try to talk brilliantly.  Rouge and\nesprit used to go together.  That has all gone out now.  As long as a\nwoman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is\nperfectly satisfied.  As for conversation, there are only five women\nin London worth talking to, and two of these can’t be admitted into\ndecent society.  However, tell me about your genius.  How long have\nyou known her?”",
        "“About three weeks.  Not so much.  About two weeks and two days.”",
        "“How did you come across her?”",
        "“I will tell you, Harry; but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.\nAfter all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.  You\nfilled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.  For days\nafter I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins.  As I lounged\nin the Park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one\nwho passed me, and wonder with a mad curiosity what sort of lives\nthey led.  Some of them fascinated me.  Others filled me with terror.\nThere was an exquisite poison in the air.  I had a passion for\nsensations.",
        "“One evening about seven o’clock I determined to go out in search of\nsome adventure.  I felt that this gray, monstrous London of ours,\nwith its myriads of people, its splendid sinners, and its sordid\nsins, as [25] you once said, must have something in store for me.  I\nfancied a thousand things.",
        "“The mere danger gave me a sense of delight.  I remembered what you\nhad said to me on that wonderful night when we first dined together,\nabout the search for beauty being the poisonous secret of life.  I\ndon’t know what I expected, but I went out, and wandered eastward,\nsoon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black,\ngrassless squares.  About half-past eight I passed by a little third-\nrate theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.  A\nhideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life,\nwas standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.  He had greasy\nringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled\nshirt.  ’’Ave a box, my lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took\noff his hat with an act of gorgeous servility.  There was something\nabout him, Harry, that amused me.  He was such a monster.  You will\nlaugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for\nthe stage-box.  To the present day I can’t make out why I did so; and\nyet if I hadn’t!–my dear Harry, if I hadn’t, I would have missed the\ngreatest romance of my life.  I see you are laughing.  It is horrid\nof you!”",
        "“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.  But\nyou should not say the greatest romance of your life.  You should say\nthe first romance of your life.  You will always be loved, and you\nwill always be in love with love.  There are exquisite things in\nstore for you.  This is merely the beginning.”",
        "“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray, angrily.",
        "“No; I think your nature so deep.”",
        "“How do you mean?”",
        "“My dear boy, people who only love once in their lives are really\nshallow people.  What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I\ncall either the lethargy of custom or the lack of imagination.\nFaithlessness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the\nintellectual life,–simply a confession of failure.  But I don’t want\nto interrupt you.  Go on with your story.”",
        "“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a\nvulgar drop-scene staring me in the face.  I looked out behind the\ncurtain, and surveyed the house.  It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids\nand cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake.  The gallery and pit\nwere fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty,\nand there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the\ndress-circle.  Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and\nthere was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”",
        "“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British Drama.”",
        "“Just like, I should fancy, and very horrid.  I began to wonder what\non earth I should do, when I caught sight of the play-bill.  What do\nyou think the play was, Harry?”",
        "“I should think ’The Idiot Boy, or Dumb but Innocent.’  Our fathers\nused to like that sort of piece, I believe.  The longer I live,\nDorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our\nfathers is not good enough for us.  In art, as in politics, les grand\npères ont toujours tort.”",
        "[26] “This play was good enough for us, Harry.  It was ’Romeo and\nJuliet.’  I must admit I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing\nShakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place.  Still, I felt\ninterested, in a sort of way.  At any rate, I determined to wait for\nthe first act.  There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a\nyoung Jew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but\nat last the drop-scene was drawn up, and the play began.  Romeo was a\nstout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice,\nand a figure like a beer-barrel.  Mercutio was almost as bad.  He was\nplayed by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and\nwas on most familiar terms with the pit.  They were as grotesque as\nthe scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a pantomime of\nfifty years ago.  But Juliet!  Harry, imagine a girl, hardly\nseventeen years of age, with a little flower-like face, a small Greek\nhead with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet\nwells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.  She was\nthe loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life.  You said to me once\nthat pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could\nfill your eyes with tears.  I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see\nthis girl for the mist of tears that came across me.  And her voice,-\n-I never heard such a voice.  It was very low at first, with deep\nmellow notes, that seemed to fall singly upon one’s ear.  Then it\nbecame a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant\nhautbois.  In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that\none hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.  There were\nmoments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins.  You know\nhow a voice can stir one.  Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are\ntwo things that I shall never forget.  When I close my eyes, I hear\nthem, and each of them says something different.  I don’t know which\nto follow.  Why should I not love her?  Harry, I do love her.  She is\neverything to me in life.  Night after night I go to see her play.\nOne evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen.  I\nhave seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison\nfrom her lover’s lips.  I have watched her wandering through the\nforest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and\ndainty cap.  She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a\nguilty king, and given him rue to wear, and bitter herbs to taste of.\nShe has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed\nher reed-like throat.  I have seen her in every age and in every\ncostume.  Ordinary women never appeal to one’s imagination.  They are\nlimited to their century.  No glamour ever transfigures them.  One\nknows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets.  One can\nalways find them.  There is no mystery in one of them.  They ride in\nthe Park in the morning, and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.\nThey have their stereotyped smile, and their fashionable manner.\nThey are quite obvious.  But an actress!  How different an actress\nis!  Why didn’t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an\nactress?”",
        "“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”",
        "“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”",
        "“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces.  There is an\nextraordinary charm in them, sometimes.”",
        "[27] “I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”",
        "“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian.  All through your life\nyou will tell me everything you do.”",
        "“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true.  I cannot help telling you\nthings.  You have a curious influence over me.  If I ever did a\ncrime, I would come and confide it to you.  You would understand me.”",
        "“People like you–the wilful sunbeams of life–don’t commit crimes,\nDorian.  But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.  And\nnow tell me,–reach me the matches, like a good boy: thanks,–tell\nme, what are your relations with Sibyl Vane?”",
        "Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.\n\"Harry, Sibyl Vane is sacred!”",
        "“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said\nLord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice.  “But why\nshould you be annoyed?  I suppose she will be yours some day.  When\none is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one\nalways ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls\nromance.  You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”",
        "“Of course I know her.  On the first night I was at the theatre, the\nhorrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over,\nand offered to bring me behind the scenes and introduce me to her.  I\nwas furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for\nhundreds of years, and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in\nVerona.  I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he thought I\nhad taken too much champagne, or something.”",
        "“I am not surprised.”",
        "“I was not surprised either.  Then he asked me if I wrote for any of\nthe newspapers.  I told him I never even read them.  He seemed\nterribly disappointed at that, and confided to me that all the\ndramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were\nall to be bought.”",
        "“I believe he was quite right there.  But, on the other hand, most of\nthem are not at all expensive.”",
        "“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means.  By this time\nthe lights were being put out in the theatre, and I had to go.  He\nwanted me to try some cigars which he strongly recommended.  I\ndeclined.  The next night, of course, I arrived at the theatre again.\nWhen he saw me he made me a low bow, and assured me that I was a\npatron of art.  He was a most offensive brute, though he had an\nextraordinary passion for Shakespeare.  He told me once, with an air\nof pride, that his three bankruptcies were entirely due to the poet,\nwhom he insisted on calling ’The Bard.’  He seemed to think it a\ndistinction.”",
        "“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian,–a great distinction.  But\nwhen did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”",
        "“The third night.  She had been playing Rosalind.  I could not help\ngoing round.  I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at\nme; at least I fancied that she had.  The old Jew was persistent.  He\nseemed determined to bring me behind, so I consented.  It was curious\nmy not wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”",
        "[28] “No; I don’t think so.”",
        "“My dear Harry, why?”",
        "“I will tell you some other time.  Now I want to know about the\ngirl.”",
        "“Sibyl?  Oh, she was so shy, and so gentle.  There is something of a\nchild about her.  Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I\ntold her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite\nunconscious of her power.  I think we were both rather nervous.  The\nold Jew stood grinning at the door-way of the dusty greenroom, making\nelaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each\nother like children.  He would insist on calling me ’My Lord,’ so I\nhad to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind.  She said\nquite simply to me, ’You look more like a prince.’”",
        "“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”",
        "“You don’t understand her, Harry.  She regarded me merely as a person\nin a play.  She knows nothing of life.  She lives with her mother, a\nfaded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta\ndressing-wrapper on the first night, and who looks as if she had seen\nbetter days.”",
        "“I know that look.  It always depresses me.”",
        "“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not\ninterest me.”",
        "“You were quite right.  There is always something infinitely mean\nabout other people’s tragedies.”",
        "“Sibyl is the only thing I care about.  What is it to me where she\ncame from?  From her little head to her little feet, she is\nabsolutely and entirely divine.  I go to see her act every night of\nmy life, and every night she is more marvellous.”",
        "“That is the reason, I suppose, that you will never dine with me now.\nI thought you must have some curious romance on hand.  You have; but\nit is not quite what I expected.”",
        "“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have\nbeen to the Opera with you several times.”",
        "“You always come dreadfully late.”",
        "“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play, even if it is only for\nan act.  I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the\nwonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am\nfilled with awe.”",
        "“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”",
        "He shook his head.  “To night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and\ntomorrow night she will be Juliet.”",
        "“When is she Sibyl Vane?”",
        "“Never.”",
        "“I congratulate you.”",
        "“How horrid you are!  She is all the great heroines of the world in\none.  She is more than an individual.  You laugh, but I tell you she\nhas genius.  I love her, and I must make her love me.  You, who know\nall the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me!\nI want to make Romeo jealous.  I want the dead lovers of the [29]\nworld to hear our laughter, and grow sad.  I want a breath of our\npassion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes\ninto pain.  My God, Harry, how I worship her!”  He was walking up and\ndown the room as he spoke.  Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks.\nHe was terribly excited.",
        "Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure.  How\ndifferent he was now from the shy, frightened boy he had met in Basil\nHallward’s studio!  His nature had developed like a flower, had borne\nblossoms of scarlet flame.  Out of its secret hiding-place had crept\nhis Soul, and Desire had come to meet it on the way.",
        "“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry, at last.",
        "“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.  I\nhave not the slightest fear of the result.  You won’t be able to\nrefuse to recognize her genius.  Then we must get her out of the\nJew’s hands.  She is bound to him for three years–at least for two\nyears and eight months–from the present time.  I will have to pay\nhim something, of course.  When all that is settled, I will take a\nWest-End theatre and bring her out properly.  She will make the world\nas mad as she has made me.”",
        "“Impossible, my dear boy!”",
        "“Yes, she will.  She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in\nher, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it\nis personalities, not principles, that move the age.”",
        "“Well, what night shall we go?”",
        "“Let me see.  To-day is Tuesday.  Let us fix to-morrow.  She plays\nJuliet to-morrow.”",
        "“All right.  The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”",
        "“Not eight, Harry, please.  Half-past six.  We must be there before\nthe curtain rises.  You must see her in the first act, where she\nmeets Romeo.”",
        "“Half-past six!  What an hour!  It will be like having a meat-tea.\nHowever, just as you wish.  Shall you see Basil between this and\nthen?  Or shall I write to him?”",
        "“Dear Basil!  I have not laid eyes on him for a week.  It is rather\nhorrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful\nframe, designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of it\nfor being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I\ndelight in it.  Perhaps you had better write to him.  I don’t want to\nsee him alone.  He says things that annoy me.”",
        "Lord Henry smiled.  “He gives you good advice, I suppose.  People are\nvery fond of giving away what they need most themselves.”",
        "“You don’t mean to say that Basil has got any passion or any romance\nin him?”",
        "“I don’t know whether he has any passion, but he certainly has\nromance,” said Lord Henry, with an amused look in his eyes.  “Has he\nnever let you know that?”",
        "“Never.  I must ask him about it.  I am rather surprised to hear it.\nHe is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a\nPhilistine.  Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.”",
        "“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into\n[30] his work.  The consequence is that he has nothing left for life\nbut his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense.  The only\nartists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad\nartists.  Good artists give everything to their art, and consequently\nare perfectly uninteresting in themselves.  A great poet, a really\ngreat poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.  But inferior\npoets are absolutely fascinating.  The worse their rhymes are, the\nmore picturesque they look.  The mere fact of having published a book\nof second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.  He lives the\npoetry that he cannot write.  The others write the poetry that they\ndare not realize.”",
        "“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some\nperfume on his handkerchief out of a large gold-topped bottle that\nstood on the table.  “It must be, if you say so.  And now I must be\noff.  Imogen is waiting for me.  Don’t forget about to-morrow.  Good-\nby.”",
        "As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began\nto think.  Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as\nDorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused\nhim not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.  He was pleased\nby it.  It made him a more interesting study.  He had been always\nenthralled by the methods of science, but the ordinary subject-matter\nof science had seemed to him trivial and of no import.  And so he had\nbegun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.\nHuman life,–that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.\nThere was nothing else of any value, compared to it.  It was true\nthat as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and\npleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, or keep\nthe sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the\nimagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.\nThere were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to\nsicken of them.  There were maladies so strange that one had to pass\nthrough them if one sought to understand their nature.  And, yet,\nwhat a great reward one received!  How wonderful the whole world\nbecame to one!  To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the\nemotional colored life of the intellect,–to observe where they met,\nand where they separated, at what point they became one, and at what\npoint they were at discord,–there was a delight in that!  What\nmatter what the cost was?  One could never pay too high a price for\nany sensation.",
        "He was conscious–and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into\nhis brown agate eyes–that it was through certain words of his,\nmusical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul\nhad turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her.  To a\nlarge extent, the lad was his own creation.  He had made him\npremature.  That was something.  Ordinary people waited till life\ndisclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the\nmysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.\nSometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of\nliterature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the\nintellect.  But now and then a complex personality took the place and\nassumed the office of art, was indeed, in its [31] way, a real work\nof art, Life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has,\nor sculpture, or painting.",
        "Yes, the lad was premature.  He was gathering his harvest while it\nwas yet spring.  The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he\nwas becoming self-conscious.  It was delightful to watch him.  With\nhis beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder\nat.  It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end.  He\nwas like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose\njoys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense\nof beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.",
        "Soul and body, body and soul–how mysterious they were!  There was\nanimalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.\nThe senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.  Who could\nsay where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?\nHow shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!\nAnd yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various\nschools!  Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?  Or was\nthe body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?  The\nseparation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of\nspirit with matter was a mystery also.",
        "He began to wonder whether we should ever make psychology so absolute\na science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.\nAs it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood\nothers.  Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name\nwe gave to our mistakes.  Men had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode\nof warning, had claimed for it a certain moral efficacy in the\nformation of character, had praised it as something that taught us\nwhat to follow and showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive\npower in experience.  It was as little of an active cause as\nconscience itself.  All that it really demonstrated was that our\nfuture would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done\nonce, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.",
        "It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method\nby which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions;\nand certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed\nto promise rich and fruitful results.  His sudden mad love for Sibyl\nVane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.  There was\nno doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the\ndesire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather a very\ncomplex passion.  What there was in it of the purely sensuous\ninstinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the\nimagination, changed into something that seemed to the boy himself to\nbe remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more\ndangerous.  It was the passions about whose origin we deceived\nourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us.  Our weakest motives\nwere those of whose nature we were conscious.  It often happened that\nwhen we thought we were experimenting on others we were really\nexperimenting on ourselves.",
        "While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the\ndoor, and his valet entered, and reminded him it was time to dress\n[32] for dinner.  He got up and looked out into the street.  The\nsunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses\nopposite.  The panes glowed like plates of heated metal.  The sky\nabove was like a faded rose.  He thought of Dorian Gray’s young\nfiery-colored life, and wondered how it was all going to end.",
        "When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a\ntelegram lying on the hall-table.  He opened it and found it was from\nDorian.  It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to\nSibyl Vane.",
        "“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry\non the following evening, as Hallward was shown into a little private\nroom at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.",
        "“No, Harry,” answered Hallward, giving his hat and coat to the bowing\nwaiter.  “What is it?  Nothing about politics, I hope?  They don’t\ninterest me.  There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons\nworth painting; though many of them would be the better for a little\nwhitewashing.”",
        "“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him\nas he spoke.",
        "Hallward turned perfectly pale, and a curious look flashed for a\nmoment into his eyes, and then passed away, leaving them dull.\"\nDorian engaged to be married!” he cried.  “Impossible!”",
        "“It is perfectly true.”",
        "“To whom?”",
        "“To some little actress or other.”",
        "“I can’t believe it.  Dorian is far too sensible.”",
        "“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my\ndear Basil.”",
        "“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry,\"\nsaid Hallward, smiling.",
        "“Except in America.  But I didn’t say he was married.  I said he was\nengaged to be married.  There is a great difference.  I have a\ndistinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at\nall of being engaged.  I am inclined to think that I never was\nengaged.”",
        "“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth.  It would be\nabsurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”",
        "“If you want him to marry this girl, tell him that, Basil.  He is\nsure to do it then.  Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing,\nit is always from the noblest motives.”",
        "“I hope the girl is good, Harry.  I don’t want to see Dorian tied to\nsome vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his\nintellect.”",
        "“Oh, she is more than good–she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry,\nsipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters.  “Dorian says she is\nbeautiful; and he is not often wrong about things of that kind.  [33]\nYour portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal\nappearance of other people.  It has had that excellent effect, among\nothers.  We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his\nappointment.”",
        "“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked Hallward, walking up and\ndown the room, and biting his lip.  “You can’t approve of it, really.\nIt is some silly infatuation.”",
        "“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now.  It is an absurd\nattitude to take towards life.  We are not sent into the world to air\nour moral prejudices.  I never take any notice of what common people\nsay, and I never interfere with what charming people do.  If a\npersonality fascinates me, whatever the personality chooses to do is\nabsolutely delightful to me.  Dorian Gray falls in love with a\nbeautiful girl who acts Shakespeare, and proposes to marry her.  Why\nnot?  If he wedded Messalina he would be none the less interesting.\nYou know I am not a champion of marriage.  The real drawback to\nmarriage is that it makes one unselfish.  And unselfish people are\ncolorless.  They lack individuality.  Still, there are certain\ntemperaments that marriage makes more complex.  They retain their\negotism, and add to it many other egos.  They are forced to have more\nthan one life.  They become more highly organized.  Besides, every\nexperience is of value, and, whatever one may say against marriage,\nit is certainly an experience.  I hope that Dorian Gray will make\nthis girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then\nsuddenly become fascinated by some one else.  He would be a wonderful\nstudy.”",
        "“You don’t mean all that, Harry; you know you don’t.  If Dorian\nGray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than yourself.  You\nare much better than you pretend to be.”",
        "Lord Henry laughed.  “The reason we all like to think so well of\nothers is that we are all afraid for ourselves.  The basis of\noptimism is sheer terror.  We think that we are generous because we\ncredit our neighbor with those virtues that are likely to benefit\nourselves.  We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account,\nand find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may\nspare our pockets.  I mean everything that I have said.  I have the\ngreatest contempt for optimism.  And as for a spoiled life, no life\nis spoiled but one whose growth is arrested.  If you want to mar a\nnature, you have merely to reform it.  But here is Dorian himself.\nHe will tell you more than I can.”",
        "“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said\nthe boy, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings,\nand shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn.  “I have never\nbeen so happy.  Of course it is sudden: all really delightful things\nare.  And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking\nfor all my life.”  He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and\nlooked extraordinarily handsome.",
        "“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I\ndon’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your\nengagement.  You let Harry know.”",
        "“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord\n[34] Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder, and smiling as he\nspoke.  “Come, let us sit down and try what the new chef here is\nlike, and then you will tell us how it all came about.”",
        "“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian, as they took their\nseats at the small round table.  “What happened was simply this.\nAfter I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I had some dinner at that\ncurious little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street, you introduced me\nto, and went down afterwards to the theatre.  Sibyl was playing\nRosalind.  Of course the scenery was dreadful, and the Orlando\nabsurd.  But Sibyl!  You should have seen her!  When she came on in\nher boy’s dress she was perfectly wonderful.  She wore a moss-colored\nvelvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim brown cross-gartered hose,\na dainty little green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel,\nand a hooded cloak lined with dull red.  She had never seemed to me\nmore exquisite.  She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra\nfigurine that you have in your studio, Basil.  Her hair clustered\nround her face like dark leaves round a pale rose.  As for her\nacting–well, you will see her to-night.  She is simply a born\nartist.  I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled.  I forgot that\nI was in London and in the nineteenth century.  I was away with my\nlove in a forest that no man had ever seen.  After the performance\nwas over I went behind, and spoke to her.  As we were sitting\ntogether, suddenly there came a look into her eyes that I had never\nseen there before.  My lips moved towards hers.  We kissed each\nother.  I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment.  It\nseemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point\nof rose-colored joy.  She trembled all over, and shook like a white\nnarcissus.  Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands.\nI feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it.  Of\ncourse our engagement is a dead secret.  She has not even told her\nown mother.  I don’t know what my guardians will say.  Lord Radley is\nsure to be furious.  I don’t care.  I shall be of age in less than a\nyear, and then I can do what I like.  I have been right, Basil,\nhaven’t I, to take my love out of poetry, and to find my wife in\nShakespeare’s plays?  Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have\nwhispered their secret in my ear.  I have had the arms of Rosalind\naround me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.”",
        "“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward, slowly.",
        "“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.",
        "Dorian Gray shook his head.  “I left her in the forest of Arden, I\nshall find her in an orchard in Verona.”",
        "Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner.  “At what\nparticular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? and what\ndid she say in answer?  Perhaps you forgot all about it.”",
        "“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I\ndid not make any formal proposal.  I told her that I loved her, and\nshe said she was not worthy to be my wife.  Not worthy!  Why, the\nwhole world is nothing to me compared to her.”",
        "“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry,–\"much more\npractical than we are.  In situations of that kind we often forget to\nsay anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”",
        "[35] Hallward laid his hand upon his arm.  “Don’t, Harry.  You have\nannoyed Dorian.  He is not like other men.  He would never bring\nmisery upon any one.  His nature is too fine for that.”",
        "Lord Henry looked across the table.  “Dorian is never annoyed with\nme,” he answered.  “I asked the question for the best reason\npossible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking\nany question,–simple curiosity.  I have a theory that it is always\nthe women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women,\nexcept, of course, in middle-class life.  But then the middle classes\nare not modern.”",
        "Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head.  “You are quite\nincorrigible, Harry; but I don’t mind.  It is impossible to be angry\nwith you.  When you see Sibyl Vane you will feel that the man who\ncould wrong her would be a beast without a heart.  I cannot\nunderstand how any one can wish to shame what he loves.  I love Sibyl\nVane.  I wish to place her on a pedestal of gold, and to see the\nworld worship the woman who is mine.  What is marriage?  An\nirrevocable vow.  And it is an irrevocable vow that I want to take.\nHer trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good.  When I am\nwith her, I regret all that you have taught me.  I become different\nfrom what you have known me to be.  I am changed, and the mere touch\nof Sibyl Vane’s hand makes me forget you and all your wrong,\nfascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.”",
        "“You will always like me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry.  “Will you have\nsome coffee, you fellows?–Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne,\nand some cigarettes.  No: don’t mind the cigarettes; I have some.–\nBasil, I can’t allow you to smoke cigars.  You must have a cigarette.\nA cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.  It is\nexquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.  What more can you want?–\nYes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me.  I represent to you all\nthe sins you have never had the courage to commit.”",
        "“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried Dorian Gray, lighting his\ncigarette from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had\nplaced on the table.  “Let us go down to the theatre.  When you see\nSibyl you will have a new ideal of life.  She will represent\nsomething to you that you have never known.”",
        "“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a sad look in his\neyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion.  I am afraid that\nthere is no such thing, for me at any rate.  Still, your wonderful\ngirl may thrill me.  I love acting.  It is so much more real than\nlife.  Let us go.  Dorian, you will come with me.–I am so sorry,\nBasil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.  You must\nfollow us in a hansom.”",
        "They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing.\nHallward was silent and preoccupied.  There was a gloom over him.  He\ncould not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better\nthan many other things that might have happened.  After a few\nmoments, they all passed down-stairs.  He drove off by himself, as\nhad been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little\nbrougham in front of him.  A strange sense of loss came over him.\n[36] He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he\nhad been in the past.  His eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring\nstreets became blurred to him.  When the cab drew up at the doors of\nthe theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.",
        "For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night,\nand the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear\nto ear with an oily, tremulous smile.  He escorted them to their box\nwith a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands, and\ntalking at the top of his voice.  Dorian Gray loathed him more than\never.  He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met\nby Caliban.  Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him.  At\nleast he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand,\nand assured him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a\nreal genius and gone bankrupt over Shakespeare.  Hallward amused\nhimself with watching the faces in the pit.  The heat was terribly\noppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with\npetals of fire.  The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats\nand waistcoats and hung them over the side.  They talked to each\nother across the theatre, and shared their oranges with the tawdry\npainted girls who sat by them.  Some women were laughing in the pit;\ntheir voices were horribly shrill and discordant.  The sound of the\npopping of corks came from the bar.",
        "“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.",
        "“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray.  “It was here I found her, and she is\ndivine beyond all living things.  When she acts you will forget\neverything.  These common people here, with their coarse faces and\nbrutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.\nThey sit silently and watch her.  They weep and laugh as she wills\nthem to do.  She makes them as responsive as a violin.  She\nspiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and\nblood as one’s self.”",
        "“Oh, I hope not!” murmured Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants\nof the gallery through his opera-glass.",
        "“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said Hallward.  “I\nunderstand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.  Any one you\nlove must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you\ndescribe must be fine and noble.  To spiritualize one’s age,–that is\nsomething worth doing.  If this girl can give a soul to those who\nhave lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in\npeople whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them\nof their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not\ntheir own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the\nadoration of the world.  This marriage is quite right.  I did not\nthink so at first, but I admit it now.  God made Sibyl Vane for you.\nWithout her you would have been incomplete.”",
        "“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand.  “I [37]\nknew that you would understand me.  Harry is so cynical, he terrifies\nme.  But here is the orchestra.  It is quite dreadful, but it only\nlasts for about five minutes.  Then the curtain rises, and you will\nsee the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have\ngiven everything that is good in me.”",
        "A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of\napplause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage.  Yes, she was certainly\nlovely to look at,–one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry\nthought, that he had ever seen.  There was something of the fawn in\nher shy grace and startled eyes.  A faint blush, like the shadow of a\nrose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the\ncrowded, enthusiastic house.  She stepped back a few paces, and her\nlips seemed to tremble.  Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began\nto applaud.  Dorian Gray sat motionless, gazing on her, like a man in\na dream.  Lord Henry peered through his opera-glass, murmuring,\n\"Charming! charming!”",
        "The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s\ndress had entered with Mercutio and his friends.  The band, such as\nit was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.  Through\nthe crowd of ungainly, shabbily-dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like\na creature from a finer world.  Her body swayed, as she danced, as a\nplant sways in the water.  The curves of her throat were like the\ncurves of a white lily.  Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.",
        "Yet she was curiously listless.  She showed no sign of joy when her\neyes rested on Romeo.  The few lines she had to speak,–",
        "with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly\nartificial manner.  The voice was exquisite, but from the point of\nview of tone it was absolutely false.  It was wrong in color.  It\ntook away all the life from the verse.  It made the passion unreal.",
        "Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her.  Neither of his friends\ndared to say anything to him.  She seemed to them to be absolutely\nincompetent.  They were horribly disappointed.",
        "Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene\nof the second act.  They waited for that.  If she failed there, there\nwas nothing in her.",
        "She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight.  That could not\nbe denied.  But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew\nworse as she went on.  Her gestures became absurdly artificial.  She\nover-emphasized everything that she had to say.  The beautiful\npassage,–",
        "[38] was declaimed with the painful precision of a school-girl who\nhas been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution.\nWhen she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines,–",
        "she spoke the words as if they conveyed no meaning to her.  It was\nnot nervousness.  Indeed, so far from being nervous, she seemed\nabsolutely self-contained.  It was simply bad art.  She was a\ncomplete failure.",
        "Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their\ninterest in the play.  They got restless, and began to talk loudly\nand to whistle.  The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the\ndress-circle, stamped and swore with rage.  The only person unmoved\nwas the girl herself.",
        "When the second act was over there came a storm of hisses, and Lord\nHenry got up from his chair and put on his coat.  “She is quite\nbeautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act.  Let us go.”",
        "“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard,\nbitter voice.  “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an\nevening, Harry.  I apologize to both of you.”",
        "“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted\nHallward.  “We will come some other night.”",
        "“I wish she was ill,” he rejoined.  “But she seems to me to be simply\ncallous and cold.  She has entirely altered.  Last night she was a\ngreat artist.  To-night she is merely a commonplace, mediocre\nactress.”",
        "“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian.  Love is a more\nwonderful thing than art.”",
        "“They are both simply forms of imitation,” murmured Lord Henry.  “But\ndo let us go.  Dorian, you must not stay here any longer.  It is not\ngood for one’s morals to see bad acting.  Besides, I don’t suppose\nyou will want your wife to act.  So what does it matter if she plays\nJuliet like a wooden doll?  She is very lovely, and if she knows as\nlittle about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful\nexperience.  There are only two kinds of people who are really\nfascinating,–people who know absolutely everything, and people who\nknow absolutely nothing.  Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so\ntragic!  The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion\nthat is unbecoming.  Come to the club with Basil and myself.  We will\nsmoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.  She is\nbeautiful.  What more can you want?”",
        "“Please go away, Harry,” cried the lad.  “I really want to be alone.-\n-Basil, you don’t mind my asking you to go?  Ah! can’t you see that\nmy heart is breaking?”  The hot tears came to his eyes.  His [39]\nlips trembled, and, rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up\nagainst the wall, hiding his face in his hands.",
        "“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in his\nvoice; and the two young men passed out together.",
        "A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up, and the curtain\nrose on the third act.  Dorian Gray went back to his seat.  He looked\npale, and proud, and indifferent.  The play dragged on, and seemed\ninterminable.  Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy\nboots, and laughing.  The whole thing was a fiasco.  The last act was\nplayed to almost empty benches.",
        "As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the\ngreenroom.  The girl was standing alone there, with a look of triumph\non her face.  Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.  There was a\nradiance about her.  Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of\ntheir own.",
        "When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy\ncame over her.  “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.",
        "“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement,–\"horribly!  It\nwas dreadful.  Are you ill?  You have no idea what it was.  You have\nno idea what I suffered.”",
        "The girl smiled.  “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name\nwith long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than\nhoney to the red petals of her lips,–\"Dorian, you should have\nunderstood.  But you understand now, don’t you?”",
        "“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.",
        "“Why I was so bad to-night.  Why I shall always be bad.  Why I shall\nnever act well again.”",
        "He shrugged his shoulders.  “You are ill, I suppose.  When you are\nill you shouldn’t act.  You make yourself ridiculous.  My friends\nwere bored.  I was bored.”",
        "She seemed not to listen to him.  She was transfigured with joy.  An\necstasy of happiness dominated her.",
        "“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one\nreality of my life.  It was only in the theatre that I lived.  I\nthought that it was all true.  I was Rosalind one night, and Portia\nthe other.  The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of\nCordelia were mine also.  I believed in everything.  The common\npeople who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike.  The painted\nscenes were my world.  I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them\nreal.  You came,–oh, my beautiful love!–and you freed my soul from\nprison.  You taught me what reality really is.  To-night, for the\nfirst time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the\nsilliness, of the empty pageant in which I had always played.  To-\nnight, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was\nhideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was\nfalse, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak\nwere unreal, were not my words, not what I wanted to say.  You had\nbrought me something higher, something of which all art is but a\nreflection.  You have made me understand what love really is.  My\nlove! my love!  I am sick [40] of shadows.  You are more to me than\nall art can ever be.  What have I to do with the puppets of a play?\nWhen I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that\neverything had gone from me.  Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it\nall meant.  The knowledge was exquisite to me.  I heard them hissing,\nand I smiled.  What should they know of love?  Take me away, Dorian–\ntake me away with you, where we can be quite alone.  I hate the\nstage.  I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot\nmimic one that burns me like fire.  Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you\nunderstand now what it all means?  Even if I could do it, it would be\nprofanation for me to play at being in love.  You have made me see\nthat.”",
        "He flung himself down on the sofa, and turned away his face.  “You\nhave killed my love,” he muttered.",
        "She looked at him in wonder, and laughed.  He made no answer.  She\ncame across to him, and stroked his hair with her little fingers.\nShe knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips.  He drew them away,\nand a shudder ran through him.",
        "Then he leaped up, and went to the door.  “Yes,” he cried, “you have\nkilled my love.  You used to stir my imagination.  Now you don’t even\nstir my curiosity.  You simply produce no effect.  I loved you\nbecause you were wonderful, because you had genius and intellect,\nbecause you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and\nsubstance to the shadows of art.  You have thrown it all away.  You\nare shallow and stupid.  My God! how mad I was to love you!  What a\nfool I have been!  You are nothing to me now.  I will never see you\nagain.  I will never think of you.  I will never mention your name.\nYou don’t know what you were to me, once.  Why, once . . . . Oh, I\ncan’t bear to think of it!  I wish I had never laid eyes upon you!\nYou have spoiled the romance of my life.  How little you can know of\nlove, if you say it mars your art!  What are you without your art?\nNothing.  I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent.  The\nworld would have worshipped you, and you would have belonged to me.\nWhat are you now?  A third-rate actress with a pretty face.”",
        "The girl grew white, and trembled.  She clinched her hands together,\nand her voice seemed to catch in her throat.  “You are not serious,\nDorian?” she murmured.  “You are acting.”",
        "“Acting!  I leave that to you.  You do it so well,” he answered,\nbitterly.",
        "She rose from her knees, and, with a piteous expression of pain in\nher face, came across the room to him.  She put her hand upon his\narm, and looked into his eyes.  He thrust her back.  “Don’t touch\nme!” he cried.",
        "A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet, and lay\nthere like a trampled flower.  “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she\nwhispered.  “I am so sorry I didn’t act well.  I was thinking of you\nall the time.  But I will try,–indeed, I will try.  It came so\nsuddenly across me, my love for you.  I think I should never have\nknown it if you had not kissed me,–if we had not kissed each other.\nKiss me again, my love.  Don’t go away from me.  I couldn’t bear it.\nCan’t you forgive me for to-night?  I will work so hard, and try to\n[41] improve.  Don’t be cruel to me because I love you better than\nanything in the world.  After all, it is only once that I have not\npleased you.  But you are quite right, Dorian.  I should have shown\nmyself more of an artist.  It was foolish of me; and yet I couldn’t\nhelp it.  Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.”  A fit of passionate\nsobbing choked her.  She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing,\nand Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his\nchiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.  There is always\nsomething ridiculous about the passions of people whom one has ceased\nto love.  Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.  Her\ntears and sobs annoyed him.",
        "“I am going,” he said at last, in his calm, clear voice.  “I don’t\nwish to be unkind, but I can’t see you again.  You have disappointed\nme.”",
        "She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer to him.  Her\nlittle hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for\nhim.  He turned on his heel, and left the room.  In a few moments he\nwas out of the theatre.",
        "Where he went to, he hardly knew.  He remembered wandering through\ndimly-lit streets with gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking\nhouses.  Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after\nhim.  Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves\nlike monstrous apes.  He had seen grotesque children huddled upon\ndoor-steps, and had heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.",
        "When the dawn was just breaking he found himself at Covent Garden.\nHuge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the\npolished empty street.  The air was heavy with the perfume of the\nflowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his\npain.  He followed into the market, and watched the men unloading\ntheir wagons.  A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries.  He\nthanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them,\nand began to eat them listlessly.  They had been plucked at midnight,\nand the coldness of the moon had entered into them.  A long line of\nboys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses,\ndefiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge jade-\ngreen piles of vegetables.  Under the portico, with its gray sun-\nbleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,\nwaiting for the auction to be over.  After some time he hailed a\nhansom and drove home.  The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of\nthe houses glistened like silver against it.  As he was passing\nthrough the library towards the door of his bedroom, his eye fell\nupon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him.  He started back\nin surprise, and then went over to it and examined it.  In the dim\narrested light that struggled through the cream-colored silk blinds,\nthe face seemed to him to be a little changed.  The expression looked\ndifferent.  One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in\nthe mouth.  It was certainly curious.",
        "He turned round, and, walking to the window, drew the blinds up.  The\nbright dawn flooded the room, and swept the fantastic shadows [42]\ninto dusky corners, where they lay shuddering.  But the strange\nexpression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to\nlinger there, to be more intensified even.  The quivering, ardent\nsunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly\nas if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some\ndreadful thing.",
        "He winced, and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in\nivory Cupids, that Lord Henry had given him, he glanced hurriedly\ninto it.  No line like that warped his red lips.  What did it mean?",
        "He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\nagain.  There were no signs of any change when he looked into the\nactual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression\nhad altered.  It was not a mere fancy of his own.  The thing was\nhorribly apparent.",
        "He threw himself into a chair, and began to think.  Suddenly there\nflashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio\nthe day the picture had been finished.  Yes, he remembered it\nperfectly.  He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain\nyoung, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be\nuntarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his\npassions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with\nthe lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the\ndelicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.\nSurely his prayer had not been answered?  Such things were\nimpossible.  It seemed monstrous even to think of them.  And, yet,\nthere was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the\nmouth.",
        "Cruelty!  Had he been cruel?  It was the girl’s fault, not his.  He\nhad dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her\nbecause he had thought her great.  Then she had disappointed him.\nShe had been shallow and unworthy.  And, yet, a feeling of infinite\nregret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing\nlike a little child.  He remembered with what callousness he had\nwatched her.  Why had he been made like that?  Why had such a soul\nbeen given to him?  But he had suffered also.  During the three\nterrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of\npain, aeon upon aeon of torture.  His life was well worth hers.  She\nhad marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age.\nBesides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men.  They\nlived on their emotions.  They only thought of their emotions.  When\nthey took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could\nhave scenes.  Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what\nwomen were.  Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane?  She was nothing\nto him now.",
        "But the picture?  What was he to say of that?  It held the secret of\nhis life, and told his story.  It had taught him to love his own\nbeauty.  Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?  Would he ever\nlook at it again?",
        "No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.  The\nhorrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.\nSuddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that\n[43] makes men mad.  The picture had not changed.  It was folly to\nthink so.",
        "Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\nsmile.  Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.  Its blue eyes\nmet his own.  A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the\npainted image of himself, came over him.  It had altered already, and\nwould alter more.  Its gold would wither into gray.  Its red and\nwhite roses would die.  For every sin that he committed, a stain\nwould fleck and wreck its fairness.  But he would not sin.  The\npicture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of\nconscience.  He would resist temptation.  He would not see Lord Henry\nany more,–would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous\ntheories that in Basil Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him\nthe passion for impossible things.  He would go back to Sibyl Vane,\nmake her amends, marry her, try to love her again.  Yes, it was his\nduty to do so.  She must have suffered more than he had.  Poor child!\nHe had been selfish and cruel to her.  The fascination that she had\nexercised over him would return.  They would be happy together.  His\nlife with her would be beautiful and pure.",
        "He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of\nthe portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.  “How horrible!” he\nmurmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened\nit.  When he stepped out on the grass, he drew a deep breath.  The\nfresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions.  He\nthought only of Sibyl Vane.  A faint echo of his love came back to\nhim.  He repeated her name over and over again.  The birds that were\nsinging in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers\nabout her.",
        "It was long past noon when he awoke.  His valet had crept\nseveral times into the room on tiptoe to see if he was stirring, and\nhad wondered what made his young master sleep so late.  Finally his\nbell sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile\nof letters, on a small tray of old Sèvres china, and drew back the\nolive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in\nfront of the three tall windows.",
        "“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.",
        "“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray, sleepily.",
        "“One hour and a quarter, monsieur.”",
        "How late it was!  He sat up, and, having sipped some tea, turned over\nhis letters.  One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought\nby hand that morning.  He hesitated for a moment, and then put it\naside.  The others he opened listlessly.  They contained the usual\ncollection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private\nviews, programmes of charity concerts, and the like, that are\nshowered on fashionable young men every morning during the season.\nThere was a [44] rather heavy bill, for a chased silver Louis-Quinze\ntoilet-set, that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his\nguardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not\nrealize that we live in an age when only unnecessary things are\nabsolutely necessary to us; and there were several very courteously\nworded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to\nadvance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the most\nreasonable rates of interest.",
        "After about ten minutes he got up, and, throwing on an elaborate\ndressing-gown, passed into the onyx-paved bath-room.  The cool water\nrefreshed him after his long sleep.  He seemed to have forgotten all\nthat he had gone through.  A dim sense of having taken part in some\nstrange tragedy came to him once or twice, but there was the\nunreality of a dream about it.",
        "As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a\nlight French breakfast, that had been laid out for him on a small\nround table close to an open window.  It was an exquisite day.  The\nwarm air seemed laden with spices.  A bee flew in, and buzzed round\nthe blue-dragon bowl, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, that stood in\nfront of him.  He felt perfectly happy.",
        "Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of\nthe portrait, and he started.",
        "“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the\ntable.  “I shut the window?”",
        "Dorian shook his head.  “I am not cold,” he murmured.",
        "Was it all true?  Had the portrait really changed?  Or had it been\nsimply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where\nthere had been a look of joy?  Surely a painted canvas could not\nalter?  The thing was absurd.  It would serve as a tale to tell Basil\nsome day.  It would make him smile.",
        "And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!  First\nin the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the\ntouch of cruelty in the warped lips.  He almost dreaded his valet\nleaving the room.  He knew that when he was alone he would have to\nexamine the portrait.  He was afraid of certainty.  When the coffee\nand cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a\nmad desire to tell him to remain.  As the door closed behind him he\ncalled him back.  The man stood waiting for his orders.  Dorian\nlooked at him for a moment.  “I am not at home to any one, Victor,\"\nhe said, with a sigh.  The man bowed and retired.",
        "He rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a\nluxuriously-cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.  The screen\nwas an old one of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a\nrather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern.  He scanned it curiously,\nwondering if it had ever before concealed the secret of a man’s life.",
        "Should he move it aside, after all?  Why not let it stay there?  What\nwas the use of knowing?  If the thing was true, it was terrible.  If\nit was not true, why trouble about it?  But what if, by some fate or\ndeadlier chance, other eyes than his spied behind, and saw the\nhorrible change?  What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked\nto look at his own picture?  He would be sure to do that.  No; the\n[45] thing had to be examined, and at once.  Anything would be better\nthan this dreadful state of doubt.",
        "He got up, and locked both doors.  At least he would be alone when he\nlooked upon the mask of his shame.  Then he drew the screen aside,\nand saw himself face to face.  It was perfectly true.  The portrait\nhad altered.",
        "As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder,\nhe found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of\nalmost scientific interest.  That such a change should have taken\nplace was incredible to him.  And yet it was a fact.  Was there some\nsubtle affinity between the chemical atoms, that shaped themselves\ninto form and color on the canvas, and the soul that was within him?\nCould it be that what that soul thought, they realized?–that what it\ndreamed, they made true?  Or was there some other, more terrible\nreason?  He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch,\nlay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.",
        "One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him.  It had made\nhim conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane.  It\nwas not too late to make reparation for that.  She could still be his\nwife.  His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher\ninfluence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the\nportrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to\nhim through life, would be to him what holiness was to some, and\nconscience to others, and the fear of God to us all.  There were\nopiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep.\nBut here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin.  Here was an\never-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.",
        "Three o’clock struck, and four, and half-past four, but he did not\nstir.  He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life, and to\nweave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine\nlabyrinth of passion through which he was wandering.  He did not know\nwhat to do, or what to think.  Finally, he went over to the table and\nwrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her\nforgiveness, and accusing himself of madness.  He covered page after\npage with wild words of sorrow, and wilder words of pain.  There is a\nluxury in self-reproach.  When we blame ourselves we feel that no one\nelse has a right to blame us.  It is the confession, not the priest,\nthat gives us absolution.  When Dorian Gray had finished the letter,\nhe felt that he had been forgiven.",
        "Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s\nvoice outside.  “My dear Dorian, I must see you.  Let me in at once.\nI can’t bear your shutting yourself up like this.”",
        "He made no answer at first, but remained quite still.  The knocking\nstill continued, and grew louder.  Yes, it was better to let Lord\nHenry in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to\nquarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if\nparting was inevitable.  He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across\nthe picture, and unlocked the door.",
        "“I am so sorry for it all, my dear boy,” said Lord Henry, coming in.\n\"But you must not think about it too much.”",
        "[46] “Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked Dorian.",
        "“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair, and\nslowly pulling his gloves off.  “It is dreadful, from one point of\nview, but it was not your fault.  Tell me, did you go behind and see\nher after the play was over?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“I felt sure you had.  Did you make a scene with her?”",
        "“I was brutal, Harry,–perfectly brutal.  But it is all right now.  I\nam not sorry for anything that has happened.  It has taught me to\nknow myself better.”",
        "“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way!  I was afraid I\nwould find you plunged in remorse, and tearing your nice hair.”",
        "“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head, and\nsmiling.  “I am perfectly happy now.  I know what conscience is, to\nbegin with.  It is not what you told me it was.  It is the divinest\nthing in us.  Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more,–at least not\nbefore me.  I want to be good.  I can’t bear the idea of my soul\nbeing hideous.”",
        "“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian!  I congratulate\nyou on it.  But how are you going to begin?”",
        "“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”",
        "“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up, and looking at\nhim in perplexed amazement.  “But, my dear Dorian–”",
        "“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say.  Something dreadful\nabout marriage.  Don’t say it.  Don’t ever say things of that kind to\nme again.  Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me.  I am not going to\nbreak my word to her.  She is to be my wife.”",
        "“Your wife!  Dorian! . . . Didn’t you get my letter?  I wrote to you\nthis morning, and sent the note down, by my own man.”",
        "“Your letter?  Oh, yes, I remember.  I have not read it yet, Harry.\nI was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like.”",
        "Lord Henry walked across the room, and, sitting down by Dorian Gray,\ntook both his hands in his, and held them tightly.  “Dorian,” he\nsaid, “my letter–don’t be frightened–was to tell you that Sibyl\nVane is dead.”",
        "A cry of pain rose from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,\ntearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp.  “Dead!  Sibyl dead!\nIt is not true!  It is a horrible lie!”",
        "“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely.  “It is in all\nthe morning papers.  I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any\none till I came.  There will have to be an inquest, of course, and\nyou must not be mixed up in it.  Things like that make a man\nfashionable in Paris.  But in London people are so prejudiced.  Here,\none should never make one’s début with a scandal.  One should reserve\nthat to give an interest to one’s old age.  I don’t suppose they know\nyour name at the theatre.  If they don’t, it is all right.  Did any\none see you going round to her room?  That is an important point.”",
        "Dorian did not answer for a few moments.  He was dazed with horror.\nFinally he murmured, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an\ninquest?  What did you mean by that?  Did Sibyl–?  Oh, [47] Harry, I\ncan’t bear it!  But be quick.  Tell me everything at once.”",
        "“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be\nput in that way to the public.  As she was leaving the theatre with\nher mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten\nsomething up-stairs.  They waited some time for her, but she did not\ncome down again.  They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor\nof her dressing-room.  She had swallowed something by mistake, some\ndreadful thing they use at theatres.  I don’t know what it was, but\nit had either prussic acid or white lead in it.  I should fancy it\nwas prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.  It is\nvery tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it.\nI see by the Standard that she was seventeen.  I should have thought\nshe was almost younger than that.  She looked such a child, and\nseemed to know so little about acting.  Dorian, you mustn’t let this\nthing get on your nerves.  You must come and dine with me, and\nafterwards we will look in at the Opera.  It is a Patti night, and\neverybody will be there.  You can come to my sister’s box.  She has\ngot some smart women with her.”",
        "“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,–\n\"murdered her as certainly as if I had cut her little throat with a\nknife.  And the roses are not less lovely for all that.  The birds\nsing just as happily in my garden.  And to-night I am to dine with\nyou, and then go on to the Opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose,\nafterwards.  How extraordinarily dramatic life is!  If I had read all\nthis in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it.  Somehow,\nnow that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too\nwonderful for tears.  Here is the first passionate love-letter I have\never written in my life.  Strange, that my first passionate love-\nletter should have been addressed to a dead girl.  Can they feel, I\nwonder, those white silent people we call the dead?  Sibyl!  Can she\nfeel, or know, or listen?  Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!  It seems\nyears ago to me now.  She was everything to me.  Then came that\ndreadful night–was it really only last night?–when she played so\nbadly, and my heart almost broke.  She explained it all to me.  It\nwas terribly pathetic.  But I was not moved a bit.  I thought her\nshallow.  Then something happened that made me afraid.  I can’t tell\nyou what it was, but it was awful.  I said I would go back to her.  I\nfelt I had done wrong.  And now she is dead.  My God! my God!  Harry,\nwhat shall I do?  You don’t know the danger I am in, and there is\nnothing to keep me straight.  She would have done that for me.  She\nhad no right to kill herself.  It was selfish of her.”",
        "“My dear Dorian, the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by\nboring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life.\nIf you had married this girl you would have been wretched.  Of course\nyou would have treated her kindly.  One can always be kind to people\nabout whom one cares nothing.  But she would have soon found out that\nyou were absolutely indifferent to her.  And when a woman finds that\nout about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears\nvery smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to [48] pay\nfor.  I say nothing about the social mistake, but I assure you that\nin any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”",
        "“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room,\nand looking horribly pale.  “But I thought it was my duty.  It is not\nmy fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was\nright.  I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about\ngood resolutions,–that they are always made too late.  Mine\ncertainly were.”",
        "“Good resolutions are simply a useless attempt to interfere with\nscientific laws.  Their origin is pure vanity.  Their result is\nabsolutely nil.  They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious\nsterile emotions that have a certain charm for us.  That is all that\ncan be said for them.”",
        "“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,\n\"why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?  I\ndon’t think I am heartless.  Do you?”",
        "“You have done too many foolish things in your life to be entitled to\ngive yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, with his\nsweet, melancholy smile.",
        "The lad frowned.  “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he\nrejoined, “but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless.  I am\nnothing of the kind.  I know I am not.  And yet I must admit that\nthis thing that has happened does not affect me as it should.  It\nseems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play.\nIt has all the terrible beauty of a great tragedy, a tragedy in which\nI took part, but by which I have not been wounded.”",
        "“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an\nexquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism,–\"an\nextremely interesting question.  I fancy that the explanation is\nthis.  It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such\nan inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their\nabsolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack\nof style.  They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.  They give us\nan impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.\nSometimes, however, a tragedy that has artistic elements of beauty\ncrosses our lives.  If these elements of beauty are real, the whole\nthing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  Suddenly we\nfind that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the\nplay.  Or rather we are both.  We watch ourselves, and the mere\nwonder of the spectacle enthralls us.  In the present case, what is\nit that has really happened?  Some one has killed herself for love of\nyou.  I wish I had ever had such an experience.  It would have made\nme in love with love for the rest of my life.  The people who have\nadored me–there have not been very many, but there have been some–\nhave always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care\nfor them, or they to care for me.  They have become stout and\ntedious, and when I meet them they go in at once for reminiscences.\nThat awful memory of woman!  What a fearful thing it is!  And what an\nutter intellectual stagnation it reveals!  One should absorb the\ncolor of life, but one should never remember its details.  Details\nare always vulgar.",
        "[49] “Of course, now and then things linger.  I once wore nothing but\nviolets all through one season, as mourning for a romance that would\nnot die.  Ultimately, however, it did die.  I forget what killed it.\nI think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me.\nThat is always a dreadful moment.  It fills one with the terror of\neternity.  Well,–would you believe it?–a week ago, at Lady\nHampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in\nquestion, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and\ndigging up the past, and raking up the future.  I had buried my\nromance in a bed of poppies.  She dragged it out again, and assured\nme that I had spoiled her life.  I am bound to state that she ate an\nenormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.  But what a lack of\ntaste she showed!  The one charm of the past is that it is the past.\nBut women never know when the curtain has fallen.  They always want a\nsixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over\nthey propose to continue it.  If they were allowed to have their way,\nevery comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would\nculminate in a farce.  They are charmingly artificial, but they have\nno sense of art.  You are more fortunate than I am.  I assure you,\nDorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me\nwhat Sibyl Vane did for you.  Ordinary women always console\nthemselves.  Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colors.\nNever trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a\nwoman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.  It always means\nthat they have a history.  Others find a great consolation in\nsuddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands.  They\nflaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it was the most\nfascinating of sins.  Religion consoles some.  Its mysteries have all\nthe charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me; and I can quite\nunderstand it.  Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that\none is a sinner.  There is really no end to the consolations that\nwomen find in modern life.  Indeed, I have not mentioned the most\nimportant one of all.”",
        "“What is that, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, listlessly.",
        "“Oh, the obvious one.  Taking some one else’s admirer when one loses\none’s own.  In good society that always whitewashes a woman.  But\nreally, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the\nwomen one meets!  There is something to me quite beautiful about her\ndeath.  I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.\nThey make one believe in the reality of the things that shallow,\nfashionable people play with, such as romance, passion, and love.”",
        "“I was terribly cruel to her.  You forget that.”",
        "“I believe that women appreciate cruelty more than anything else.\nThey have wonderfully primitive instincts.  We have emancipated them,\nbut they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same.  They\nlove being dominated.  I am sure you were splendid.  I have never\nseen you angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked.  And,\nafter all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that\nseemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now\nwas absolutely true, and it explains everything.”",
        "[50] “What was that, Harry?”",
        "“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines\nof romance–that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other;\nthat if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”",
        "“She will never come to life again now,” murmured the lad, burying\nhis face in his hands.",
        "“No, she will never come to life.  She has played her last part.  But\nyou must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room\nsimply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a\nwonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.  The girl\nnever really lived, and so she has never really died.  To you at\nleast she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through\nShakespeare’s plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed\nthrough which Shakespeare’s music sounded richer and more full of\njoy.  The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it\nmarred her, and so she passed away.  Mourn for Ophelia, if you like.\nPut ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled.  Cry out\nagainst Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died.  But don’t\nwaste your tears over Sibyl Vane.  She was less real than they are.”",
        "There was a silence.  The evening darkened in the room.  Noiselessly,\nand with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden.  The\ncolors faded wearily out of things.",
        "After some time Dorian Gray looked up.  “You have explained me to\nmyself, Harry,” he murmured, with something of a sigh of relief.  “I\nfelt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I\ncould not express it to myself.  How well you know me!  But we will\nnot talk again of what has happened.  It has been a marvellous\nexperience.  That is all.  I wonder if life has still in store for me\nanything as marvellous.”",
        "“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian.  There is nothing that\nyou, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”",
        "“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and gray, and wrinkled?  What\nthen?”",
        "“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go,–\"then, my dear Dorian,\nyou would have to fight for your victories.  As it is, they are\nbrought to you.  No, you must keep your good looks.  We live in an\nage that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be\nbeautiful.  We cannot spare you.  And now you had better dress, and\ndrive down to the club.  We are rather late, as it is.”",
        "“I think I shall join you at the Opera, Harry.  I feel too tired to\neat anything.  What is the number of your sister’s box?”",
        "“Twenty-seven, I believe.  It is on the grand tier.  You will see her\nname on the door.  But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”",
        "“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian, wearily.  “But I am awfully\nobliged to you for all that you have said to me.  You are certainly\nmy best friend.  No one has ever understood me as you have.”",
        "“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered\nLord Henry, shaking him by the hand.  “Good-by.  I shall see you\nbefore nine-thirty, I hope.  Remember, Patti is singing.”",
        "As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, [51]\nand in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the\nblinds down.  He waited impatiently for him to go.  The man seemed to\ntake an interminable time about everything.",
        "As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen, and drew it back.\nNo; there was no further change in the picture.  It had received the\nnews of Sibyl Vane’s death before he had known of it himself.  It was\nconscious of the events of life as they occurred.  The vicious\ncruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt,\nappeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison,\nwhatever it was.  Or was it indifferent to results?  Did it merely\ntake cognizance of what passed within the soul? he wondered, and\nhoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his\nvery eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.",
        "Poor Sibyl! what a romance it had all been!  She had often mimicked\ndeath on the stage, and at last Death himself had touched her, and\nbrought her with him.  How had she played that dreadful scene?  Had\nshe cursed him, as she died?  No; she had died for love of him, and\nlove would always be a sacrament to him now.  She had atoned for\neverything, by the sacrifice she had made of her life.  He would not\nthink any more of what she had made him go through, that horrible\nnight at the theatre.  When he thought of her, it would be as a\nwonderful tragic figure to show Love had been a great reality.  A\nwonderful tragic figure?  Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her\nchild-like look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace.\nHe wiped them away hastily, and looked again at the picture.",
        "He felt that the time had really come for making his choice.  Or had\nhis choice already been made?  Yes, life had decided that for him,–\nlife, and his own infinite curiosity about life.  Eternal youth,\ninfinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder\nsins,–he was to have all these things.  The portrait was to bear the\nburden of his shame: that was all.",
        "A feeling of pain came over him as he thought of the desecration that\nwas in store for the fair face on the canvas.  Once, in boyish\nmockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those\npainted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him.  Morning after\nmorning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty,\nalmost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times.  Was it to\nalter now with every mood to which he yielded?  Was it to become a\nhideous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to\nbe shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter\ngold the waving wonder of the hair?  The pity of it! the pity of it!",
        "For a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that\nexisted between him and the picture might cease.  It had changed in\nanswer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain\nunchanged.  And, yet, who, that knew anything about Life, would\nsurrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic\nthat chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be\nfraught?  Besides, was it really under his control?  Had it indeed\nbeen prayer that had produced the substitution?  Might there not be\nsome curious scientific reason for it all?  If thought could exercise\nits [52] influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise\nan influence upon dead and inorganic things?  Nay, without thought or\nconscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in\nunison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom, in secret\nlove or strange affinity?  But the reason was of no importance.  He\nwould never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power.  If the\npicture was to alter, it was to alter.  That was all.  Why inquire\ntoo closely into it?",
        "For there would be a real pleasure in watching it.  He would be able\nto follow his mind into its secret places.  This portrait would be to\nhim the most magical of mirrors.  As it had revealed to him his own\nbody, so it would reveal to him his own soul.  And when winter came\nupon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the\nverge of summer.  When the blood crept from its face, and left behind\na pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of\nboyhood.  Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade.  Not one\npulse of his life would ever weaken.  Like the gods of the Greeks, he\nwould be strong, and fleet, and joyous.  What did it matter what\nhappened to the colored image on the canvas?  He would be safe.  That\nwas everything.",
        "He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the\npicture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his\nvalet was already waiting for him.  An hour later he was at the\nOpera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.",
        "As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward\nwas shown into the room.",
        "“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said, gravely.  “I called\nlast night, and they told me you were at the Opera.  Of course I knew\nthat was impossible.  But I wish you had left word where you had\nreally gone to.  I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one\ntragedy might be followed by another.  I think you might have\ntelegraphed for me when you heard of it first.  I read of it quite by\nchance in a late edition of the Globe, that I picked up at the club.\nI came here at once, and was miserable at not finding you.  I can’t\ntell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing.  I know what\nyou must suffer.  But where were you?  Did you go down and see the\ngirl’s mother?  For a moment I thought of following you there.  They\ngave the address in the paper.  Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t\nit?  But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not\nlighten.  Poor woman!  What a state she must be in!  And her only\nchild, too!  What did she say about it all?”",
        "“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian, sipping some pale-\nyellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass, and\nlooking dreadfully bored.  “I was at the Opera.  You should have come\non there.  I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time.\nWe were in her box.  She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang\ndivinely.  Don’t talk about horrid subjects.  If one doesn’t [53]\ntalk about a thing, it has never happened.  It is simply expression,\nas Harry says, that gives reality to things.  Tell me about yourself\nand what you are painting.”",
        "“You went to the Opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly, and\nwith a strained touch of pain in his voice.  “You went to the Opera\nwhile Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?  You can talk\nto me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely,\nbefore the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?\nWhy, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of\nhers!”",
        "“Stop, Basil!  I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet.\n\"You must not tell me about things.  What is done is done.  What is\npast is past.”",
        "“You call yesterday the past?”",
        "“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?  It is only\nshallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.  A man who\nis master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a\npleasure.  I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions.  I want to\nuse them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”",
        "“Dorian, this is horrible!  Something has changed you completely.\nYou look exactly the same wonderful boy who used to come down to my\nstudio, day after day, to sit for his picture.  But you were simple,\nnatural, and affectionate then.  You were the most unspoiled creature\nin the whole world.  Now, I don’t know what has come over you.  You\ntalk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.  It is all Harry’s\ninfluence.  I see that.”",
        "The lad flushed up, and, going to the window, looked out on the\ngreen, flickering garden for a few moments.  “I owe a great deal to\nHarry, Basil,” he said, at last,–\"more than I owe to you.  You only\ntaught me to be vain.”",
        "“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian,–or shall be some day.”",
        "“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning round.  “I\ndon’t know what you want.  What do you want?”",
        "“I want the Dorian Gray I used to know.”",
        "“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him, and putting his hand on his\nshoulder, “you have come too late.  Yesterday when I heard that Sibyl\nVane had killed herself–”",
        "“Killed herself!  Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?” cried\nHallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.",
        "“My dear Basil!  Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident?  Of\ncourse she killed herself  It is one of the great romantic tragedies\nof the age.  As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace\nlives.  They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something\ntedious.  You know what I mean,–middle-class virtue, and all that\nkind of thing.  How different Sibyl was!  She lived her finest\ntragedy.  She was always a heroine.  The last night she played–the\nnight you saw her–she acted badly because she had known the reality\nof love.  When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have\ndied.  She passed again into the sphere of art.  There is something\nof the martyr about her.  Her death has all the pathetic uselessness\nof [54] martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.  But, as I was saying, you\nmust not think I have not suffered.  If you had come in yesterday at\na particular moment,–about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to\nsix,–you would have found me in tears.  Even Harry, who was here,\nwho brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going\nthrough.  I suffered immensely, then it passed away.  I cannot repeat\nan emotion.  No one can, except sentimentalists.  And you are awfully\nunjust, Basil.  You come down here to console me.  That is charming\nof you.  You find me consoled, and you are furious.  How like a\nsympathetic person!  You remind me of a story Harry told me about a\ncertain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying\nto get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered,–I\nforget exactly what it was.  Finally he succeeded, and nothing could\nexceed his disappointment.  He had absolutely nothing to do, almost\ndied of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope.  And besides, my\ndear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to\nforget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point\nof view.  Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation\ndes arts?  I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your\nstudio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.  Well, I am\nnot like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlowe\ntogether, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could\nconsole one for all the miseries of life.  I love beautiful things\nthat one can touch and handle.  Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-\nwork, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp,–there\nis much to be got from all these.  But the artistic temperament that\nthey create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me.  To become\nthe spectator of one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the\nsuffering of life.  I know you are surprised at my talking to you\nlike this.  You have not realized how I have developed.  I was a\nschool-boy when you knew me.  I am a man now.  I have new passions,\nnew thoughts, new ideas.  I am different, but you must not like me\nless.  I am changed, but you must always be my friend.  Of course I\nam very fond of Harry.  But I know that you are better than he is.\nYou are not stronger,–you are too much afraid of life,–but you are\nbetter.  And how happy we used to be together!  Don’t leave me,\nBasil, and don’t quarrel with me.  I am what I am.  There is nothing\nmore to be said.”",
        "Hallward felt strangely moved.  Rugged and straightforward as he was,\nthere was something in his nature that was purely feminine in its\ntenderness.  The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his personality\nhad been the great turning-point in his art.  He could not bear the\nidea of reproaching him any more.  After all, his indifference was\nprobably merely a mood that would pass away.  There was so much in\nhim that was good, so much in him that was noble.",
        "“Well, Dorian,” he said, at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak\nto you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.  I only trust\nyour name won’t be mentioned in connection with it.  The inquest is\nto take place this afternoon.  Have they summoned you?”",
        "Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face\nat the mention of the word “inquest.”  There was something so [55]\ncrude and vulgar about everything of the kind.  “They don’t know my\nname,” he answered.",
        "“But surely she did?”",
        "“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned\nto any one.  She told me once that they were all rather curious to\nlearn who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince\nCharming.  It was pretty of her.  You must do me a drawing of her,\nBasil.  I should like to have something more of her than the memory\nof a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”",
        "“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.  But\nyou must come and sit to me yourself again.  I can’t get on without\nyou.”",
        "“I will never sit to you again, Basil.  It is impossible!” he\nexclaimed, starting back.",
        "Hallward stared at him, “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried.  “Do\nyou mean to say you don’t like what I did of you?  Where is it?  Why\nhave you pulled the screen in front of it?  Let me look at it.  It is\nthe best thing I have ever painted.  Do take that screen away,\nDorian.  It is simply horrid of your servant hiding my work like\nthat.  I felt the room looked different as I came in.”",
        "“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil.  You don’t imagine I\nlet him arrange my room for me?  He settles my flowers for me\nsometimes,–that is all.  No; I did it myself.  The light was too\nstrong on the portrait.”",
        "“Too strong!  Impossible, my dear fellow!  It is an admirable place\nfor it.  Let me see it.”  And Hallward walked towards the corner of\nthe room.",
        "A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between\nHallward and the screen.  “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you\nmust not look at it.  I don’t wish you to.”",
        "“Not look at my own work! you are not serious.  Why shouldn’t I look\nat it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.",
        "“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honor I will never\nspeak to you again as long as I live.  I am quite serious.  I don’t\noffer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.  But,\nremember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us.”",
        "Hallward was thunderstruck.  He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute\namazement.  He had never seen him like this before.  The lad was\nabsolutely pallid with rage.  His hands were clinched, and the pupils\nof his eyes were like disks of blue fire.  He was trembling all over.",
        "“Dorian!”",
        "“Don’t speak!”",
        "“But what is the matter?  Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t\nwant me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel, and going\nover towards the window.  “But, really, it seems rather absurd that I\nshouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in\nParis in the autumn.  I shall probably have to give it another coat\nof varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-\nday?”",
        "“To exhibit it!  You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a\nstrange sense of terror creeping over him.  Was the world going [56]\nto be shown his secret?  Were people to gape at the mystery of his\nlife?  That was impossible.  Something–he did not know what–had to\nbe done at once.",
        "“Yes: I don’t suppose you will object to that.  Georges Petit is\ngoing to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the\nRue de Sèze, which will open the first week in October.  The portrait\nwill only be away a month.  I should think you could easily spare it\nfor that time.  In fact, you are sure to be out of town.  And if you\nhide it always behind a screen, you can’t care much abut it.”",
        "Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead.  There were beads of\nperspiration there.  He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible\ndanger.  “You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,\"\nhe said.  “Why have you changed your mind?  You people who go in for\nbeing consistent have just as many moods as others.  The only\ndifference is that your moods are rather meaningless.  You can’t have\nforgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world\nwould induce you to send it to any exhibition.  You told Harry\nexactly the same thing.”  He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light\ncame into his eyes.  He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him\nonce, half seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have an\ninteresting quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t\nexhibit your picture.  He told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a\nrevelation to me.”  Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret.  He\nwould ask him and try.",
        "“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close, and looking him straight\nin the face, “we have each of us a secret.  Let me know yours, and I\nwill tell you mine.  What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my\npicture?”",
        "Hallward shuddered in spite of himself.  “Dorian, if I told you, you\nmight like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me.\nI could not bear your doing either of those two things.  If you wish\nme never to look at your picture again, I am content.  I have always\nyou to look at.  If you wish the best work I have ever done to be\nhidden from the world, I am satisfied.  Your friendship is dearer to\nme than any fame or reputation.”",
        "“No, Basil, you must tell me,” murmured Dorian Gray.  “I think I have\na right to know.”  His feeling of terror had passed away, and\ncuriosity had taken its place.  He was determined to find out Basil\nHallward’s mystery.",
        "“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said Hallward, looking pale and pained.\n\"Let us sit down.  I will sit in the shadow, and you shall sit in the\nsunlight.  Our lives are like that.  Just answer me one question.\nHave you noticed in the picture something that you did not like?–\nsomething that probably at first did not strike you, but that\nrevealed itself to you suddenly?”",
        "“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with\ntrembling hands, and gazing at him with wild, startled eyes.",
        "“I see you did.  Don’t speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say.\nIt is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance of\nfeeling than a man usually gives to a friend.  Somehow, I had never\nloved a woman.  I suppose I never had time.  Perhaps, as [57] Harry\nsays, a really ’grande passion’ is the privilege of those who have\nnothing to do, and that is the use of the idle classes in a country.\nWell, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most\nextraordinary influence over me.  I quite admit that I adored you\nmadly, extravagantly, absurdly.  I was jealous of every one to whom\nyou spoke.  I wanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy\nwhen I was with you.  When I was away from you, you were still\npresent in my art.  It was all wrong and foolish.  It is all wrong\nand foolish still.  Of course I never let you know anything about\nthis.  It would have been impossible.  You would not have understood\nit; I did not understand it myself.  One day I determined to paint a\nwonderful portrait of you.  It was to have been my masterpiece.  It\nis my masterpiece.  But, as I worked at it, every flake and film of\ncolor seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraid that the world\nwould know of my idolatry.  I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much.\nThen it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be\nexhibited.  You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize\nall that it meant to me.  Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed\nat me.  But I did not mind that.  When the picture was finished, and\nI sat alone with it, I felt that I was right.  Well, after a few days\nthe portrait left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the\nintolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that I had\nbeen foolish in imagining that I had said anything in it, more than\nthat you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint.  Even\nnow I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the\npassion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one\ncreates.  Art is more abstract than we fancy.  Form and color tell us\nof form and color,–that is all.  It often seems to me that art\nconceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him.\nAnd so when I got this offer from Paris I determined to make your\nportrait the principal thing in my exhibition.  It never occurred to\nme that you would refuse.  I see now that you were right.  The\npicture must not be shown.  You must not be angry with me, Dorian,\nfor what I have told you.  As I said to Harry, once, you are made to\nbe worshipped.”",
        "Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  The color came back to his cheeks,\nand a smile played about his lips.  The peril was over.  He was safe\nfor the time.  Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the\nyoung man who had just made this strange confession to him.  He\nwondered if he would ever be so dominated by the personality of a\nfriend.  Lord Harry had the charm of being very dangerous.  But that\nwas all.  He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of.\nWould there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange\nidolatry?  Was that one of the things that life had in store?",
        "“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should\nhave seen this in the picture.  Did you really see it?”",
        "“Of course I did.”",
        "“Well, you don’t mind my looking at it now?”",
        "Dorian shook his head.  “You must not ask me that, Basil.  I could\nnot possibly let you stand in front of that picture.”",
        "“You will some day, surely?”",
        "[58] “Never.”",
        "“Well, perhaps you are right.  And now good-by, Dorian.  You have\nbeen the one person in my life of whom I have been really fond.  I\ndon’t suppose I shall often see you again.  You don’t know what it\ncost me to tell you all that I have told you.”",
        "“My dear Basil,” cried Dorian, “what have you told me?  Simply that\nyou felt that you liked me too much.  That is not even a compliment.”",
        "“It was not intended as a compliment.  It was a confession.”",
        "“A very disappointing one.”",
        "“Why, what did you expect, Dorian?  You didn’t see anything else in\nthe picture, did you?  There was nothing else to see?”",
        "“No: there was nothing else to see.  Why do you ask?  But you mustn’t\ntalk about not meeting me again, or anything of that kind.  You and I\nare friends, Basil, and we must always remain so.”",
        "“You have got Harry,” said Hallward, sadly.",
        "“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.  “Harry spends\nhis days in saying what is incredible, and his evenings in doing what\nis improbable.  Just the sort of life I would like to lead.  But\nstill I don’t think I would go to Harry if I was in trouble.  I would\nsooner go to you, Basil.”",
        "“But you won’t sit to me again?”",
        "“Impossible!”",
        "“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian.  No man comes\nacross two ideal things.  Few come across one.”",
        "“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.\nI will come and have tea with you.  That will be just as pleasant.”",
        "“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward, regretfully.\n\"And now good-by.  I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture\nonce again.  But that can’t be helped.  I quite understand what you\nfeel about it.”",
        "As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.  Poor Basil! how\nlittle he knew of the true reason!  And how strange it was that,\ninstead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had\nsucceeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!\nHow much that strange confession explained to him!  Basil’s absurd\nfits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his\ncurious reticences,–he understood them all now, and he felt sorry.\nThere was something tragic in a friendship so colored by romance.",
        "He sighed, and touched the bell.  The portrait must be hidden away at\nall costs.  He could not run such a risk of discovery again.  It had\nbeen mad of him to have the thing remain, even for an hour, in a room\nto which any of his friends had access.",
        "When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and\nwondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.  The man was\nquite impassive, and waited for his orders.  Dorian lit a cigarette,\n[59] and walked over to the glass and glanced into it.  He could see\nthe reflection of Victor’s face perfectly.  It was like a placid mask\nof servility.  There was nothing to be afraid of, there.  Yet he\nthought it best to be on his guard.",
        "Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the housekeeper that he\nwanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker’s and ask him to\nsend two of his men round at once.  It seemed to him that as the man\nleft the room he peered in the direction of the screen.  Or was that\nonly his fancy?",
        "After a few moments, Mrs. Leaf, a dear old lady in a black silk\ndress, with a photograph of the late Mr. Leaf framed in a large gold\nbrooch at her neck, and old-fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled\nhands, bustled into the room.",
        "“Well, Master Dorian,” she said, “what can I do for you?  I beg your\npardon, sir,\"–here came a courtesy,–\"I shouldn’t call you Master\nDorian any more.  But, Lord bless you, sir, I have known you since\nyou were a baby, and many’s the trick you’ve played on poor old Leaf.\nNot that you were not always a good boy, sir; but boys will be boys,\nMaster Dorian, and jam is a temptation to the young, isn’t it, sir?”",
        "He laughed.  “You must always call me Master Dorian, Leaf.  I will be\nvery angry with you if you don’t.  And I assure you I am quite as\nfond of jam now as I used to be.  Only when I am asked out to tea I\nam never offered any.  I want you to give me the key of the room at\nthe top of the house.”",
        "“The old school-room, Master Dorian?  Why, it’s full of dust.  I must\nget it arranged and put straight before you go into it.  It’s not fit\nfor you to see, Master Dorian.  It is not, indeed.”",
        "“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf.  I only want the key.”",
        "“Well, Master Dorian, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you goes into\nit.  Why, it hasn’t been opened for nearly five years,–not since his\nlordship died.”",
        "He winced at the mention of his dead uncle’s name.  He had hateful\nmemories of him.  “That does not matter, Leaf,” he replied.  “All I\nwant is the key.”",
        "“And here is the key, Master Dorian,” said the old lady, after going\nover the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands.\n\"Here is the key.  I’ll have it off the ring in a moment.  But you\ndon’t think of living up there, Master Dorian, and you so comfortable\nhere?”",
        "“No, Leaf, I don’t.  I merely want to see the place, and perhaps\nstore something in it,–that is all.  Thank you, Leaf.  I hope your\nrheumatism is better; and mind you send me up jam for breakfast.”",
        "Mrs. Leaf shook her head.  “Them foreigners doesn’t understand jam,\nMaster Dorian.  They calls it ’compot.’  But I’ll bring it to you\nmyself some morning, if you lets me.”",
        "“That will be very kind of you, Leaf,” he answered, looking at the\nkey; and, having made him an elaborate courtesy, the old lady left\nthe room, her face wreathed in smiles.  She had a strong objection to\nthe French valet.  It was a poor thing, she felt, for any one to be\nborn a foreigner.",
        "[60] As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket, and looked\nround the room.  His eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet\nheavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-\ncentury Venetian work that his uncle had found in a convent near\nBologna.  Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in.  It\nhad perhaps served often as a pall for the dead.  Now it was to hide\nsomething that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption\nof death itself,–something that would breed horrors and yet would\nnever die.  What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the\npainted image on the canvas.  They would mar its beauty, and eat away\nits grace.  They would defile it, and make it shameful.  And yet the\nthing would still live on.  It would be always alive.",
        "He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told\nBasil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.\nBasil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the\nstill more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament.\nThe love that he bore him–for it was really love–had something\nnoble and intellectual in it.  It was not that mere physical\nadmiration of beauty that is born of the senses, and that dies when\nthe senses tire.  It was such love as Michael Angelo had known, and\nMontaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.  Yes, Basil\ncould have saved him.  But it was too late now.  The past could\nalways be annihilated.  Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do\nthat.  But the future was inevitable.  There were passions in him\nthat would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the\nshadow of their evil real.",
        "He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that\ncovered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen.\nWas the face on the canvas viler than before?  It seemed to him that\nit was unchanged; and yet his loathing of it was intensified.  Gold\nhair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips,–they all were there.  It was\nsimply the expression that had altered.  That was horrible in its\ncruelty.  Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how\nshallow Basil’s reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!–how shallow,\nand of what little account!  His own soul was looking out at him from\nthe canvas and calling him to judgment.  A look of pain came across\nhim, and he flung the rich pall over the picture.  As he did so, a\nknock came to the door.  He passed out as his servant entered.",
        "“The persons are here, monsieur.”",
        "He felt that the man must be got rid of at once.  He must not be\nallowed to know where the picture was being taken to.  There was\nsomething sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.\nSitting down at the writing-table, he scribbled a note to Lord Henry,\nasking him to send him round something to read, and reminding him\nthat they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.",
        "“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men\nin here.”",
        "In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Ashton\nhimself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in\nwith a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.  Mr. Ashton was a\nflorid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was\nconsiderably [61] tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of\nthe artists who dealt with him.  As a rule, he never left his shop.\nHe waited for people to come to him.  But he always made an exception\nin favor of Dorian Gray.  There was something about Dorian that\ncharmed everybody.  It was a pleasure even to see him.",
        "“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled\nhands.  “I thought I would do myself the honor of coming round in\nperson.  I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir.  Picked it up at a\nsale.  Old Florentine.  Came from Fonthill, I believe.  Admirably\nsuited for a religious picture, Mr. Gray.”",
        "“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round,\nMr. Ashton.  I will certainly drop in and look at the frame,–though\nI don’t go in much for religious art,–but to-day I only want a\npicture carried to the top of the house for me.  It is rather heavy,\nso I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”",
        "“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray.  I am delighted to be of any service to\nyou.  Which is the work of art, sir?”",
        "“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back.  “Can you move it,\ncovering and all, just as it is?  I don’t want it to get scratched\ngoing up-stairs.”",
        "“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,\nbeginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from\nthe long brass chains by which it was suspended.  “And, now, where\nshall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”",
        "“I will show you the way, Mr. Ashton, if you will kindly follow me.\nOr perhaps you had better go in front.  I am afraid it is right at\nthe top of the house.  We will go up by the front staircase, as it is\nwider.”",
        "He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and\nbegan the ascent.  The elaborate character of the frame had made the\npicture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious\nprotests of Mr. Ashton, who had a true tradesman’s dislike of seeing\na gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it so as to\nhelp them.",
        "“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man, when they\nreached the top landing.  And he wiped his shiny forehead.",
        "“A terrible load to carry,” murmured Dorian, as he unlocked the door\nthat opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret\nof his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.",
        "He had not entered the place for more than four years,–not, indeed,\nsince he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child and\nthen as a study when he grew somewhat older.  It was a large, well-\nproportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord\nSherard for the use of the little nephew whom, being himself\nchildless, and perhaps for other reasons, he had always hated and\ndesired to keep at a distance.  It did not appear to Dorian to have\nmuch changed.  There was the huge Italian cassone, with its\nfantastically-painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in\nwhich he had so often hidden himself as a boy.  There was the\nsatinwood bookcase filled with his dog-eared school-books.  On the\nwall behind it was hanging the same [62] ragged Flemish tapestry\nwhere a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a\ncompany of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted\nwrists.  How well he recalled it all!  Every moment of his lonely\nchildhood came back to him, as he looked round.  He remembered the\nstainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him\nthat it was here that the fatal portrait was to be hidden away.  How\nlittle he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store\nfor him!",
        "But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes\nas this.  He had the key, and no one else could enter it.  Beneath\nits purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial,\nsodden, and unclean.  What did it matter?  No one could see it.  He\nhimself would not see it.  Why should he watch the hideous corruption\nof his soul?  He kept his youth,–that was enough.  And, besides,\nmight not his nature grow finer, after all?  There was no reason that\nthe future should be so full of shame.  Some love might come across\nhis life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed\nto be already stirring in spirit and in flesh,–those curious\nunpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their\ncharm.  Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from\nthe scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil\nHallward’s masterpiece.",
        "No; that was impossible.  The thing upon the canvas was growing old,\nhour by hour, and week by week.  Even if it escaped the hideousness\nof sin, the hideousness of age was in store for it.  The cheeks would\nbecome hollow or flaccid.  Yellow crow’s-feet would creep round the\nfading eyes and make them horrible.  The hair would lose its\nbrightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross,\nas the mouths of old men are.  There would be the wrinkled throat,\nthe cold blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in\nthe uncle who had been so stern to him in his boyhood.  The picture\nhad to be concealed.  There was no help for it.",
        "“Bring it in, Mr. Ashton, please,” he said, wearily, turning round.\n\"I am sorry I kept you so long.  I was thinking of something else.”",
        "“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who\nwas still gasping for breath.  “Where shall we put it, sir?”",
        "“Oh, anywhere, Here, this will do.  I don’t want to have it hung up.\nJust lean it against the wall.  Thanks.”",
        "“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”",
        "Dorian started.  “It would not interest you, Mr. Ashton,” he said,\nkeeping his eye on the man.  He felt ready to leap upon him and fling\nhim to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that\nconcealed the secret of his life.  “I won’t trouble you any more now.\nI am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”",
        "“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray.  Ever ready to do anything for\nyou, sir.”  And Mr. Ashton tramped down-stairs, followed by the\nassistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in\nhis rough, uncomely face.  He had never seen any one so marvellous.",
        "When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked [63]\nthe door, and put the key in his pocket.  He felt safe now.  No one\nwould ever look on the horrible thing.  No eye but his would ever see\nhis shame.",
        "On reaching the library he found that it was just after five o’clock,\nand that the tea had been already brought up.  On a little table of\ndark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from his\nguardian’s wife, Lady Radley, who had spent the preceding winter in\nCairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book\nbound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled.\nA copy of the third edition of the St. James’s Gazette had been\nplaced on the tea-tray.  It was evident that Victor had returned.  He\nwondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the\nhouse and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.  He would\nbe sure to miss the picture,–had no doubt missed it already, while\nhe had been laying the tea-things.  The screen had not been replaced,\nand the blank space on the wall was visible.  Perhaps some night he\nmight find him creeping up-stairs and trying to force the door of the\nroom.  It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house.  He had\nheard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some\nservant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked\nup a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered\nflower or a bit of crumpled lace.",
        "He sighed, and, having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord\nHenry’s note.  It was simply to say that he sent him round the\nevening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he would\nbe at the club at eight-fifteen.  He opened the St. James’s\nlanguidly, and looked through it.  A red pencil-mark on the fifth\npage caught his eye.  He read the following paragraph:",
        "“INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.–An inquest was held this morning at the Bell\nTavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body\nof Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,\nHolborn.  A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.\nConsiderable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased,\nwho was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and\nthat of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the\ndeceased.”",
        "He frowned slightly, and, tearing the paper in two, went across the\nroom and flung the pieces into a gilt basket.  How ugly it all was!\nAnd how horribly real ugliness made things!  He felt a little annoyed\nwith Lord Henry for having sent him the account.  And it was\ncertainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil.  Victor\nmight have read it.  The man knew more than enough English for that.",
        "Perhaps he had read it, and had begun to suspect something.  And,\nyet, what did it matter?  What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl\nVane’s death?  There was nothing to fear.  Dorian Gray had not killed\nher.",
        "His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.  What\nwas it, he wondered.  He went towards the little pearl-colored\noctagonal stand, that had always looked to him like the work of some\n[64] strange Egyptian bees who wrought in silver, and took the volume\nup.  He flung himself into an arm-chair, and began to turn over the\nleaves.  After a few minutes, he became absorbed.  It was the\nstrangest book he had ever read.  It seemed to him that in exquisite\nraiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world\nwere passing in dumb show before him.  Things that he had dimly\ndreamed of were suddenly made real to him.  Things of which he had\nnever dreamed were gradually revealed.",
        "It was a novel without a plot, and with only one character, being,\nindeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian, who\nspent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the\npassions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except\nhis own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods\nthrough which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere\nartificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called\nvirtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call\nsin.  The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled\nstyle, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms, of\ntechnical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that\ncharacterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French\nschool of Décadents.  There were in it metaphors as monstrous as\norchids, and as evil in color.  The life of the senses was described\nin the terms of mystical philosophy.  One hardly knew at times\nwhether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval\nsaint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner.  It was a\npoisonous book.  The heavy odor of incense seemed to cling about its\npages and to trouble the brain.  The mere cadence of the sentences,\nthe subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex\nrefrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of\nthe lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of revery, a\nmalady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and\nthe creeping shadows.",
        "Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky\ngleamed through the windows.  He read on by its wan light till he\ncould read no more.  Then, after his valet had reminded him several\ntimes of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and, going into the\nnext room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always\nstood at his bedside, and began to dress for dinner.",
        "It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found\nLord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very bored.",
        "“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your\nfault.  That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot what the\ntime was.”",
        "“I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his\nchair.",
        "“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry.  I said it fascinated me.  There is\na great difference.”",
        "“Ah, if you have discovered that, you have discovered a great deal,\"\nmurmured Lord Henry, with his curious smile.  “Come, let us go in to\ndinner.  It is dreadfully late, and I am afraid the champagne will be\ntoo much iced.”",
        "For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the memory of\nthis book.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never\nsought to free himself from it.  He procured from Paris no less than\nfive large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in\ndifferent colors, so that they might suit his various moods and the\nchanging fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have\nalmost entirely lost control.  The hero, the wonderful young\nParisian, in whom the romantic temperament and the scientific\ntemperament were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of\nprefiguring type of himself.  And, indeed, the whole book seemed to\nhim to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived\nit.",
        "In one point he was more fortunate than the book’s fantastic hero.\nHe never knew–never, indeed, had any cause to know–that somewhat\ngrotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still\nwater, which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and\nwas occasioned by the sudden decay of a beauty that had once,\napparently, been so remarkable.  It was with an almost cruel joy–and\nperhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty\nhas its place–that he used to read the latter part of the book, with\nits really tragic, if somewhat over-emphasized, account of the sorrow\nand despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and in the\nworld, he had most valued.",
        "He, at any rate, had no cause to fear that.  The boyish beauty that\nhad so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed\nnever to leave him.  Even those who had heard the most evil things\nagainst him (and from time to time strange rumors about his mode of\nlife crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs) could\nnot believe anything to his dishonor when they saw him.  He had\nalways the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.\nMen who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the\nroom.  There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked\nthem.  His mere presence seemed to recall to them the innocence that\nthey had tarnished.  They wondered how one so charming and graceful\nas he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once\nsordid and sensuous.",
        "He himself, on returning home from one of those mysterious and\nprolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among\nthose who were his friends, or thought that they were so, would creep\nup-stairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never\nleft him, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that\nBasil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging\nface on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back\nat him from the polished glass.  The very sharpness of the contrast\nused to quicken his sense of pleasure.  He grew more and more\nenamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the\ncorruption of his own soul.  He would examine with minute care, and\noften with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that\nseared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual\nmouth, [66] wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the\nsigns of sin or the signs of age.  He would place his white hands\nbeside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile.  He mocked\nthe misshapen body and the failing limbs.",
        "There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his\nown delicately-scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little\nill-famed tavern near the Docks, which, under an assumed name, and in\ndisguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he\nhad brought upon his soul, with a pity that was all the more poignant\nbecause it was purely selfish.  But moments such as these were rare.\nThat curiosity about life that, many years before, Lord Henry had\nfirst stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their\nfriend, seemed to increase with gratification.  The more he knew, the\nmore he desired to know.  He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous\nas he fed them.",
        "Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to\nsociety.  Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each\nWednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the\nworld his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of\nthe day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.  His\nlittle dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted\nhim, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of\nthose invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of\nthe table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers,\nand embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.\nIndeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who\nsaw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of\na type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type\nthat was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with\nall the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the\nworld.  To them he seemed to belong to those whom Dante describes as\nhaving sought to “make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.\"\nLike Gautier, he was one for whom “the visible world existed.”",
        "And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of\nthe arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a\npreparation.  Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for\na moment universal, and Dandyism, which, in its own way, is an\nattempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course,\ntheir fascination for him.  His mode of dressing, and the particular\nstyles that he affected from time to time, had their marked influence\non the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club\nwindows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to\nreproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only\nhalf-serious, fopperies.",
        "For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was\nalmost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found,\nindeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become\nto the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the\nauthor of the “Satyricon” had once been, yet in his inmost heart he\ndesired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be\nconsulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or\n[67] the conduct of a cane.  He sought to elaborate some new scheme\nof life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered\nprinciples and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest\nrealization.",
        "The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been\ndecried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and\nsensations that seem stronger than ourselves, and that we are\nconscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of\nexistence.  But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of\nthe senses had never been understood, and that they had remained\nsavage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them\ninto submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making\nthem elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for\nbeauty was to be the dominant characteristic.  As he looked back upon\nman moving through History, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So\nmuch had been surrendered! and to such little purpose!  There had\nbeen mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-\ndenial, whose origin was fear, and whose result was a degradation\ninfinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in\ntheir ignorance, they had sought to escape, Nature in her wonderful\nirony driving the anchorite out to herd with the wild animals of the\ndesert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his\ncompanions.",
        "Yes, there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new hedonism\nthat was to re-create life, and to save it from that harsh, uncomely\npuritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.  It\nwas to have its service of the intellect, certainly; yet it was never\nto accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of\nany mode of passionate experience.  Its aim, indeed, was to be\nexperience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter\nas they might be.  Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of\nthe vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.  But\nit was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life\nthat is itself but a moment.",
        "There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn,\neither after one of those dreamless nights that make one almost\nenamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen\njoy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more\nterrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that\nlurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring\nvitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of\nthose whose minds have been troubled with the malady of revery.\nGradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear\nto tremble.  Black fantastic shadows crawl into the corners of the\nroom, and crouch there.  Outside, there is the stirring of birds\namong the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or\nthe sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills, and\nwandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the\nsleepers.  Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by\ndegrees the forms and colors of things are restored to them, and we\nwatch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.  The wan\nmirrors get back their mimic life.  The flameless tapers stand where\nwe have left them, and beside them [68] lies the half-read book that\nwe had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the\nball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had\nread too often.  Nothing seems to us changed.  Out of the unreal\nshadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.  We\nhave to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a\nterrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the\nsame wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may\nbe, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had\nbeen re-fashioned anew for our pleasure in the darkness, a world in\nwhich things would have fresh shapes and colors, and be changed, or\nhave other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no\nplace, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or\nregret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the\nmemories of pleasure their pain.",
        "It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian\nGray to be the true object, or among the true objects, of life; and\nin his search for sensations that would be at once new and\ndelightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so\nessential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought\nthat he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to\ntheir subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their\ncolor and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that\ncurious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardor of\ntemperament, and that indeed, according to certain modern\npsychologists, is often a condition of it.",
        "It was rumored of him once that he was about to join the Roman\nCatholic communion; and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great\nattraction for him.  The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all\nthe sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its\nsuperb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive\nsimplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human\ntragedy that it sought to symbolize.  He loved to kneel down on the\ncold marble pavement, and with the priest, in his stiff flowered\ncope, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the\ntabernacle, and raising aloft the jewelled lantern-shaped monstrance\nwith that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed\nthe “panis caelestis,” the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments\nof the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice, and\nsmiting his breast for his sins.  The fuming censers, that the grave\nboys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt\nflowers, had their subtle fascination for him.  As he passed out, he\nused to look with wonder at the black confessionals, and long to sit\nin the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women\nwhispering through the tarnished grating the true story of their\nlives.",
        "But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual\ndevelopment by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of\nmistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable\nfor the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which\nthere are no stars and the moon is in travail.  Mysticism, with its\nmarvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the\nsubtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for\na season; and for a [69] season he inclined to the materialistic\ndoctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious\npleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly\ncell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the\nconception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain\nphysical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.  Yet, as\nhas been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of\nany importance compared with life itself.  He felt keenly conscious\nof how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from\naction and experiment.  He knew that the senses, no less than the\nsoul, have their mysteries to reveal.",
        "And so he would now study perfumes, and the secrets of their\nmanufacture, distilling heavily-scented oils, and burning odorous\ngums from the East.  He saw that there was no mood of the mind that\nhad not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to\ndiscover their true relations, wondering what there was in\nfrankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred\none’s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances,\nand in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the\nimagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of\nperfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling\nroots, and scented pollen-laden flowers, of aromatic balms, and of\ndark and fragrant woods, of spikenard that sickens, of hovenia that\nmakes men mad, and of aloes that are said to be able to expel\nmelancholy from the soul.",
        "At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long\nlatticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-\ngreen lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gypsies\ntore wild music from little zithers, or grave yellow-shawled\nTunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while\ngrinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums, or turbaned\nIndians, crouching upon scarlet mats, blew through long pipes of reed\nor brass, and charmed, or feigned to charm, great hooded snakes and\nhorrible horned adders.  The harsh intervals and shrill discords of\nbarbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and\nChopin’s beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven\nhimself, fell unheeded on his ear.  He collected together from all\nparts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found,\neither in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes\nthat have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to\ntouch and try them.  He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro\nIndians, that women are not allowed to look at, and that even youths\nmay not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging,\nand the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of\nbirds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in\nChili, and the sonorous green stones that are found near Cuzco and\ngive forth a note of singular sweetness.  He had painted gourds\nfilled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long\nclarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but\nthrough which he inhales the air; the harsh turé of the Amazon\ntribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in\ntrees, and that can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three\nleagues; the teponaztli, that [70] has two vibrating tongues of wood,\nand is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum\nobtained from the milky juice of plants; the yotl-bells of the\nAztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical\ndrum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that\nBernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and\nof whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description.  The\nfantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt\na curious delight in the thought that Art, like Nature, has her\nmonsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices.  Yet,\nafter some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the\nOpera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to\n\"Tannhäuser,” and seeing in that great work of art a presentation of\nthe tragedy of his own soul.",
        "On another occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a\ncostume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress\ncovered with five hundred and sixty pearls.  He would often spend a\nwhole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones\nthat he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns\nred by lamplight, the cymophane with its wire-like line of silver,\nthe pistachio-colored peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,\ncarbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four-rayed stars, flame-\nred cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with\ntheir alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.  He loved the red gold\nof the sunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken\nrainbow of the milky opal.  He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds\nof extraordinary size and richness of color, and had a turquoise de\nla vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.",
        "He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels.  In Alphonso’s\n\"Clericalis Disciplina” a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real\njacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander he was said to have\nfound snakes in the vale of Jordan “with collars of real emeralds\ngrowing on their backs.”  There was a gem in the brain of the dragon,\nPhilostratus told us, and “by the exhibition of golden letters and a\nscarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep, and\nslain.  According to the great alchemist Pierre de Boniface, the\ndiamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him\neloquent.  The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked\nsleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine.  The garnet\ncast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her color.\nThe selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that\ndiscovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.\nLeonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a\nnewly-killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison.  The\nbezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm\nthat could cure the plague.  In the nests of Arabian birds was the\naspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any\ndanger by fire.",
        "The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his\nhand, as the ceremony of his coronation.  The gates of the palace of\nJohn the Priest were “made of sardius, with the horn of the horned\n[71] snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.\"\nOver the gable were “two golden apples, in which were two\ncarbuncles,” so that the gold might shine by day, and the carbuncles\nby night.  In Lodge’s strange romance “A Margarite of America” it was\nstated that in the chamber of Margarite were seen “all the chaste\nladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair\nmirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene\nemeraults.”  Marco Polo had watched the inhabitants of Zipangu place\na rose-colored pearl in the mouth of the dead.  A sea-monster had\nbeen enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes,\nand had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over his loss.\nWhen the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung it away,–\nProcopius tells the story,–nor was it ever found again, though the\nEmperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it.\nThe King of Malabar had shown a Venetian a rosary of one hundred and\nfour pearls, one for every god that he worshipped.",
        "When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis\nXII. of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to\nBrantôme, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a\ngreat light.  Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with\nthree hundred and twenty-one diamonds.  Richard II. had a coat,\nvalued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies.\nHall described Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his\ncoronation, as wearing “a jacket of raised gold, the placard\nembroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great\nbauderike about his neck of large balasses.”  The favorites of James\nI. wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane.  Edward II. gave\nto Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armor studded with jacinths, and\na collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap\nparsemé with pearls.  Henry II. wore jewelled gloves reaching to the\nelbow, and had a hawk-glove set with twelve rubies and fifty-two\ngreat pearls.  The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of\nBurgundy of his race, was studded with sapphires and hung with pear-\nshaped pearls.",
        "How exquisite life had once been!  How gorgeous in its pomp and\ndecoration!  Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.",
        "Then he turned his attention to embroideries, and to the tapestries\nthat performed the office of frescos in the chill rooms of the\nNorthern nations of Europe.  As he investigated the subject,–and he\nalways had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed\nfor the moment in whatever he took up,–he was almost saddened by the\nreflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful\nthings.  He, at any rate, had escaped that.  Summer followed summer,\nand the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of\nhorror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged.  No\nwinter marred his face or stained his flower-like bloom.  How\ndifferent it was with material things!  Where had they gone to?\nWhere was the great crocus-colored robe, on which the gods fought\nagainst the giants, that had been worked for Athena?  Where the huge\nvelarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, on\nwhich were represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot\ndrawn by [72] white gilt-reined steeds?  He longed to see the curious\ntable-napkins wrought for Elagabalus, on which were displayed all the\ndainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary\ncloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the\nfantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus,\nand were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks,\nhunters,–all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature;” and the\ncoat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were\nembroidered the verses of a song beginning “Madame, je suis tout\njoyeux,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold\nthread, and each note, a square shape in those days, formed with four\npearls.  He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at\nRheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy, and was decorated with\n\"thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and\nblazoned with the king’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one\nbutterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of\nthe queen, the whole worked in gold.”  Catherine de Médicis had a\nmourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and\nsuns.  Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands,\nfigured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges\nwith broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of\nthe queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.  Louis\nXIV. had gold-embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his\napartment.  The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of\nSmyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the\nKoran.  Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and\nprofusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  It had been\ntaken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of\nMohammed had stood under it.",
        "And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite\nspecimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting\nthe dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought, with gold-threat palmates,\nand stitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes,\nthat from their transparency are known in the East as “woven air,\"\nand “running water,” and “evening dew;” strange figured cloths from\nJava; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins\nor fair blue silks and wrought with fleurs de lys, birds, and images;\nveils of lacis worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades, and stiff\nSpanish velvets; Georgian work with its gilt coins, and Japanese\nFoukousas with their green-toned golds and their marvellously-\nplumaged birds.",
        "He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as\nindeed he had for everything connected with the service of the\nChurch.  In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his\nhouse he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is\nreally the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and\njewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body\nthat is worn by the suffering that she seeks for, and wounded by\nself-inflicted pain.  He had a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and\ngold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden\npomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on\neither side was the pine- [73] apple device wrought in seed-pearls.\nThe orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the\nlife of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in\ncolored silks upon the hood.  This was Italian work of the fifteenth\ncentury.  Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-\nshaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed\nwhite blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver\nthread and colored crystals.  The morse bore a seraph’s head in gold-\nthread raised work.  The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and\ngold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and\nmartyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.  He had chasubles, also, of\namber-colored silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk\ndamask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion\nand Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks\nand other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask,\ndecorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs de lys; altar frontals\nof crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils,\nand sudaria.  In the mystic offices to which these things were put\nthere was something that quickened his imagination.",
        "For these things, and everything that he collected in his lovely\nhouse, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he\ncould escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times\nto be almost too great to be borne.  Upon the walls of the lonely\nlocked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung\nwith his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features\nshowed him the real degradation of his life, and had draped the\npurple-and-gold pall in front of it as a curtain.  For weeks he would\nnot go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back\nhis light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate pleasure in\nmere existence.  Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the\nhouse, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay\nthere, day after day, until he was driven away.  On his return he\nwould sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself,\nbut filled, at other times, with that pride of rebellion that is half\nthe fascination of sin, and smiling, with secret pleasure, at the\nmisshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been\nhis own.",
        "After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and\ngave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as\nwell as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where he had more\nthan once spent his winter.  He hated to be separated from the\npicture that was such a part of his life, and he was also afraid that\nduring his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite\nof the elaborate bolts and bars that he had caused to be placed upon\nthe door.",
        "He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.  It was\ntrue that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and\nugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could\nthey learn from that?  He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt\nhim.  He had not painted it.  What was it to him how vile and full of\nshame it looked?  Even if he told them, would they believe it?",
        "Yet he was afraid.  Sometimes when he was down at his great [74]\nhouse in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of\nhis own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county\nby the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendor of his mode of life, he\nwould suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the\ndoor had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there.\nWhat if it should be stolen?  The mere thought made him cold with\nhorror.  Surely the world would know his secret then.  Perhaps the\nworld already suspected it.",
        "For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted\nhim.  He was blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and\nsocial position fully entitled him to become a member, and on one\noccasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of\nthe Carlton, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a\nmarked manner and went out.  Curious stories became current about him\nafter he had passed his twenty-fifth year.  It was said that he had\nbeen seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant\nparts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with thieves and coiners\nand knew the mysteries of their trade.  His extraordinary absences\nbecame notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society, men\nwould whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer, or\nlook at him with cold searching eyes, as if they were determined to\ndiscover his secret.",
        "Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no\nnotice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner,\nhis charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful\nyouth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient\nanswer to the calumnies (for so they called them) that were\ncirculated about him.  It was remarked, however, that those who had\nbeen most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.  Of\nall his friends, or so-called friends, Lord Henry Wotton was the only\none who remained loyal to him.  Women who had wildly adored him, and\nfor his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at\ndefiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian\nGray entered the room.",
        "Yet these whispered scandals only lent him, in the eyes of many, his\nstrange and dangerous charm.  His great wealth was a certain element\nof security.  Society, civilized society at least, is never very\nready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich\nand charming.  It feels instinctively that manners are of more\nimportance than morals, and the highest respectability is of less\nvalue in its opinion than the possession of a good chef.  And, after\nall, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has\ngiven one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his\nprivate life.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for cold\nentrées, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject;\nand there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the\ncanons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of\nart.  Form is absolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity\nof a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the\ninsincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that\nmake such plays charming.  Is insincerity such a [75] terrible thing?\nI think not.  It is merely a method by which we can multiply our\npersonalities.",
        "Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion.  He used to wonder at\nthe shallow psychology of those who conceive the Ego in man as a\nthing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.  To him, man\nwas a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex\nmultiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of\nthought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the\nmonstrous maladies of the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt\ncold picture-gallery of his country-house and look at the various\nportraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip\nHerbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his “Memoires on the Reigns\nof Queen Elizabeth and King James,” as one who was “caressed by the\ncourt for his handsome face, which kept him not long company.”  Was\nit young Herbert’s life that he sometimes led?  Had some strange\npoisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own?\nWas it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so\nsuddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil\nHallward’s studio, to that mad prayer that had so changed his life?\nHere, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-\nedged ruff and wrist-bands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his\nsilver-and-black armor piled at his feet.  What had this man’s legacy\nbeen?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some\ninheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely the dreams\nthat the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here, from the fading\ncanvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl\nstomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand,\nand her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.\nOn a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were large\ngreen rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life, and\nthe strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he\nsomething of her temperament in him?  Those oval heavy-lidded eyes\nseemed to look curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby, with his\npowdered hair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face\nwas saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted\nwith disdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands\nthat were so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the\neighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.\nWhat of the second Lord Sherard, the companion of the Prince Regent\nin his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage\nwith Mrs. Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was, with his\nchestnut curls and insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?\nThe world had looked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at\nCarlton House.  The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.\nBeside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman\nin black.  Her blood, also, stirred within him.  How curious it all\nseemed!",
        "Yet one had ancestors in literature, as well as in one’s own race,\nnearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly\nwith an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.  There\n[76] were times when it seemed to Dorian Gray that the whole of\nhistory was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it\nin act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for\nhim, as it had been in his brain and in his passions.  He felt that\nhe had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed\nacross the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so\nfull of wonder.  It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their\nlives had been his own.",
        "The hero of the dangerous novel that had so influenced his life had\nhimself had this curious fancy.  In a chapter of the book he tells\nhow, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had\nsat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of\nElephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the\nflute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had\ncaroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables, and supped\nin an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian,\nhad wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking\nround with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to\nend his days, and sick with that ennui, that taedium vitae, that\ncomes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a\nclear emerald at the red shambles of the Circus, and then, in a\nlitter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried\nthrough the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold, and heard men\ncry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted\nhis face with colors, and plied the distaff among the women, and\nbrought the Moon from Carthage, and given her in mystic marriage to\nthe Sun.",
        "Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and\nthe chapter immediately following, in which the hero describes the\ncurious tapestries that he had had woven for him from Gustave\nMoreau’s designs, and on which were pictured the awful and beautiful\nforms of those whom Vice and Blood and Weariness had made monstrous\nor mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife, and painted her\nlips with a scarlet poison; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul\nthe Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus,\nand whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought\nat the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds\nto chase living men, and whose murdered body was covered with roses\nby a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with\nFratricide riding beside him, and his mantle stained with the blood\nof Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence,\nchild and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his\ndebauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white\nand crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy\nthat he might serve her at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin,\nwhose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and\nwho had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine,–the\nson of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father\nat dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo,\nwho in mockery took the name of Innocent, and into whose torpid veins\nthe blood of three lads was infused by a [77] Jewish doctor;\nSigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta, and the lord of Rimini,\nwhose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who\nstrangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d’Este\nin a cup of emerald, and in honor of a shameful passion built a pagan\nchurch for Christian worship; Charles VI., who had so wildly adored\nhis brother’s wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that\nwas coming on him, and who could only be soothed by Saracen cards\npainted with the images of Love and Death and Madness; and, in his\ntrimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthus-like curls, Grifonetto\nBaglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his\npage, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the\nyellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose\nbut weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.",
        "There was a horrible fascination in them all.  He saw them at night,\nand they troubled his imagination in the day.  The Renaissance knew\nof strange manners of poisoning,–poisoning by a helmet and a lighted\ntorch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded\npomander and by an amber chain.  Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a\nbook.  There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode\nthrough which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.",
        "It was on the 7th of November, the eve of his own thirty-\nsecond birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.",
        "He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he\nhad been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold\nand foggy.  At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street\na man passed him in the mist, walking very fast, and with the collar\nof his gray ulster turned up.  He had a bag in his hand.  He\nrecognized him.  It was Basil Hallward.  A strange sense of fear, for\nwhich he could not account, came over him.  He made no sign of\nrecognition, and went on slowly, in the direction of his own house.",
        "But Hallward had seen him.  Dorian heard him first stopping, and then\nhurrying after him.  In a few moments his hand was on his arm.",
        "“Dorian!  What an extraordinary piece of luck!  I have been waiting\nfor you ever since nine o’clock in your library.  Finally I took pity\non your tired servant, and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.\nI am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I wanted particularly to\nsee you before I left.  I thought it was you, or rather your fur\ncoat, as you passed me.  But I wasn’t quite sure.  Didn’t you\nrecognize me?”",
        "“In this fog, my dear Basil?  Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor\nSquare.  I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel\nat all certain about it.  I am sorry you are going away, as I have\nnot seen you for ages.  But I suppose you will be back soon?”",
        "“No: I am going to be out of England for six months.  I intend [78]\nto take a studio in Paris, and shut myself up till I have finished a\ngreat picture I have in my head.  However, it wasn’t about myself I\nwanted to talk.  Here we are at your door.  Let me come in for a\nmoment.  I have something to say to you.”",
        "“I shall be charmed.  But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian\nGray, languidly, as he passed up the steps and opened the door with\nhis latch-key.",
        "The lamp-light struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at\nhis watch.  “I have heaps of time,” he answered.  “The train doesn’t\ngo till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.  In fact, I was\non my way to the club to look for you, when I met you.  You see, I\nshan’t have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy\nthings.  All I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to\nVictoria in twenty minutes.”",
        "Dorian looked at him and smiled.  “What a way for a fashionable\npainter to travel!  A Gladstone bag, and an ulster!  Come in, or the\nfog will get into the house.  And mind you don’t talk about anything\nserious.  Nothing is serious nowadays.  At least nothing should be.”",
        "Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the\nlibrary.  There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open\nhearth.  The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case\nstood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers,\non a little table.",
        "“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian.  He gave me\neverything I wanted, including your best cigarettes.  He is a most\nhospitable creature.  I like him much better than the Frenchman you\nused to have.  What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”",
        "Dorian shrugged his shoulders.  “I believe he married Lady Ashton’s\nmaid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.\nAnglomanie is very fashionable over there now, I hear.  It seems\nsilly of the French, doesn’t it?  But–do you know?–he was not at\nall a bad servant.  I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain\nabout.  One often imagines things that are quite absurd.  He was\nreally very devoted to me, and seemed quite sorry when he went away.\nHave another brandy-and-soda?  Or would you like hock-and-seltzer?  I\nalways take hock-and-seltzer myself.  There is sure to be some in the\nnext room.”",
        "“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said Hallward, taking his cap\nand coat off, and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the\ncorner.  “And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.\nDon’t frown like that.  You make it so much more difficult for me.”",
        "“What is it all about?” cried Dorian, in his petulant way, flinging\nhimself down on the sofa.  “I hope it is not about myself.  I am\ntired of myself to-night.  I should like to be somebody else.”",
        "“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward, in his grave, deep voice,\n\"and I must say it to you.  I shall only keep you half an hour.”",
        "Dorian sighed, and lit a cigarette.  “Half an hour!” he murmured.",
        "[79] “It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for\nyour own sake that I am speaking.  I think it right that you should\nknow that the most dreadful things are being said about you in\nLondon,–things that I could hardly repeat to you.”",
        "“I don’t wish to know anything about them.  I love scandals about\nother people, but scandals about myself don’t interest me.  They have\nnot got the charm of novelty.”",
        "“They must interest you, Dorian.  Every gentleman is interested in\nhis good name.  You don’t want people to talk of you as something\nvile and degraded.  Of course you have your position, and your\nwealth, and all that kind of thing.  But position and wealth are not\neverything.  Mind you, I don’t believe these rumors at all.  At\nleast, I can’t believe them when I see you.  Sin is a thing that\nwrites itself across a man’s face.  It cannot be concealed.  People\ntalk of secret vices.  There are no such things as secret vices.  If\na wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth,\nthe droop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even.  Somebody–\nI won’t mention his name, but you know him–came to me last year to\nhave his portrait done.  I had never seen him before, and had never\nheard anything about him at the time, though I have heard a good deal\nsince.  He offered an extravagant price.  I refused him.  There was\nsomething in the shape of his fingers that I hated.  I know now that\nI was quite right in what I fancied about him.  His life is dreadful.\nBut you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your\nmarvellous untroubled youth,–I can’t believe anything against you.\nAnd yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio\nnow, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things\nthat people are whispering about you, I don’t know what to say.  Why\nis it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of\na club when you enter it?  Why is it that so many gentlemen in London\nwill neither go to your house nor invite you to theirs?  You used to\nbe a friend of Lord Cawdor.  I met him at dinner last week.  Your\nname happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the\nminiatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley.  Cawdor\ncurled his lip, and said that you might have the most artistic\ntastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be\nallowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room\nwith.  I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him\nwhat he meant.  He told me.  He told me right out before everybody.\nIt was horrible!  Why is your friendship so fateful to young men?\nThere was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.  You\nwere his great friend.  There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave\nEngland, with a tarnished name.  You and he were inseparable.  What\nabout Adrian Singleton, and his dreadful end?  What about Lord Kent’s\nonly son, and his career?  I met his father yesterday in St. James\nStreet.  He seemed broken with shame and sorrow.  What about the\nyoung Duke of Perth?  What sort of life has he got now?  What\ngentleman would associate with him?  Dorian, Dorian, your reputation\nis infamous.  I know you and Harry are great friends.  I say nothing\nabout that now, but [80] surely you need not have made his sister’s\nname a by-word.  When you met Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal\nhad ever touched her.  Is there a single decent woman in London now\nwho would drive with her in the Park?  Why, even her children are not\nallowed to live with her.  Then there are other stories,–stories\nthat you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and\nslinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London.  Are they true?\nCan they be true?  When I first heard them, I laughed.  I hear them\nnow, and they make me shudder.  What about your country-house, and\nthe life that is led there?  Dorian, you don’t know what is said\nabout you.  I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to you.  I\nremember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an\namateur curate for the moment always said that, and then broke his\nword.  I do want to preach to you.  I want you to lead such a life as\nwill make the world respect you.  I want you to have a clean name and\na fair record.  I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you\nassociate with.  Don’t shrug your shoulders like that.  Don’t be so\nindifferent.  You have a wonderful influence.  Let it be for good,\nnot for evil.  They say that you corrupt every one whom you become\nintimate with, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a\nhouse, for shame of some kind to follow after you.  I don’t know\nwhether it is so or not.  How should I know?  But it is said of you.\nI am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.  Lord Gloucester\nwas one of my greatest friends at Oxford.  He showed me a letter that\nhis wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at\nMentone.  Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I\never read.  I told him that it was absurd,–that I knew you\nthoroughly, and that you were incapable of anything of the kind.\nKnow you?  I wonder do I know you?  Before I could answer that, I\nshould have to see your soul.”",
        "“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and\nturning almost white from fear.",
        "“Yes,” answered Hallward, gravely, and with infinite sorrow in his\nvoice,–\"to see your soul.  But only God can do that.”",
        "A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man.\n\"You shall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from\nthe table.  “Come: it is your own handiwork.  Why shouldn’t you look\nat it?  You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you\nchoose.  Nobody would believe you.  If they did believe you, they’d\nlike me all the better for it.  I know the age better than you do,\nthough you will prate about it so tediously.  Come, I tell you.  You\nhave chattered enough about corruption.  Now you shall look on it\nface to face.”",
        "There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered.  He stamped\nhis foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner.  He felt a\nterrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his\nsecret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the\norigin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life\nwith the hideous memory of what he had done.",
        "“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him, and looking steadfastly\ninto his stern eyes, “I will show you my soul.  You shall see the\nthing that you fancy only God can see.”",
        "[81] Hallward started back.  “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried.\n\"You must not say things like that.  They are horrible, and they\ndon’t mean anything.”",
        "“You think so?” He laughed again.",
        "“I know so.  As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your\ngood.  You know I have been always devoted to you.”",
        "“Don’t touch me.  Finish what you have to say.”",
        "A twisted flash of pain shot across Hallward’s face.  He paused for a\nmoment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him.  After all, what\nright had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray?  If he had done a\ntithe of what was rumored about him, how much he must have suffered!\nThen he straightened himself up, and walked over to the fireplace,\nand stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frost-like\nashes and their throbbing cores of flame.",
        "“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man, in a hard, clear voice.",
        "He turned round.  “What I have to say is this,” he cried.  “You must\ngive me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against\nyou.  If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning\nto end, I will believe you.  Deny them, Dorian, deny them!  Can’t you\nsee what I am going through?  My God! don’t tell me that you are\ninfamous!”",
        "Dorian Gray smiled.  There was a curl of contempt in his lips.  “Come\nup-stairs, Basil,” he said, quietly.  “I keep a diary of my life from\nday to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written.  I\nwill show it to you if you come with me.”",
        "“I will come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.  I see I have missed\nmy train.  That makes no matter.  I can go to-morrow.  But don’t ask\nme to read anything to-night.  All I want is a plain answer to my\nquestion.”",
        "“That will be given to you up-stairs.  I could not give it here.  You\nwon’t have to read long.  Don’t keep me waiting.”",
        "He passed out of the room, and began the ascent, Basil\nHallward following close behind.  They walked softly, as men\ninstinctively do at night.  The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the\nwall and staircase.  A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.",
        "When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the\nfloor, and taking out the key turned it in the lock.  “You insist on\nknowing, Basil?” he asked, in a low voice.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“I am delighted,” he murmured, smiling.  Then he added, somewhat\nbitterly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know\neverything about me.  You have had more to do with my life than you\nthink.”  And, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.  A\ncold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment\nin a flame of murky orange.  He shuddered.  “Shut the door behind\nyou,” he said, as he placed the lamp on the table.",
        "[82] Hallward glanced round him, with a puzzled expression.  The room\nlooked as if it had not been lived in for years.  A faded Flemish\ntapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, and an almost\nempty bookcase,–that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a\nchair and a table.  As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle\nthat was standing on the mantel-shelf, he saw that the whole place\nwas covered with dust, and that the carpet was in holes.  A mouse ran\nscuffling behind the wainscoting.  There was a damp odor of mildew.",
        "“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?  Draw\nthat curtain back, and you will see mine.”",
        "The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.  “You are mad, Dorian, or\nplaying a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.",
        "“You won’t?  Then I must do it myself,” said the young man; and he\ntore the curtain from its rod, and flung it on the ground.",
        "An exclamation of horror broke from Hallward’s lips as he saw in the\ndim light the hideous thing on the canvas leering at him.  There was\nsomething in its expression that filled him with disgust and\nloathing.  Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was\nlooking at!  The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely marred\nthat marvellous beauty.  There was still some gold in the thinning\nhair and some scarlet on the sensual lips.  The sodden eyes had kept\nsomething of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not\nyet passed entirely away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic\nthroat.  Yes, it was Dorian himself.  But who had done it?  He seemed\nto recognize his own brush-work, and the frame was his own design.\nThe idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid.  He seized the lighted\ncandle, and held it to the picture.  In the left-hand corner was his\nown name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.",
        "It was some foul parody, some infamous, ignoble satire.  He had never\ndone that.  Still, it was his own picture.  He knew it, and he felt\nas if his blood had changed from fire to sluggish ice in a moment.\nHis own picture!  What did it mean?  Why had it altered?  He turned,\nand looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.  His mouth\ntwitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.  He\npassed his hand across his forehead.  It was dank with clammy sweat.",
        "The young man was leaning against the mantel-shelf, watching him with\nthat strange expression that is on the faces of those who are\nabsorbed in a play when a great artist is acting.  There was neither\nreal sorrow in it nor real joy.  There was simply the passion of the\nspectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in the eyes.  He had\ntaken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending\nto do so.",
        "“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last.  His own voice\nsounded shrill and curious in his ears.",
        "“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, “you met me, devoted\nyourself to me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good\nlooks.  One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained\nto me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that\nrevealed to me the wonder of beauty.  In a mad moment, that [83] I\ndon’t know, even now, whether I regret or not, I made a wish.\nPerhaps you would call it a prayer . . . .”",
        "“I remember it!  Oh, how well I remember it!  No! the thing is\nimpossible.  The room is damp.  The mildew has got into the canvas.\nThe paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.  I tell\nyou the thing is impossible.”",
        "“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the\nwindow, and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained\nglass.",
        "“You told me you had destroyed it.”",
        "“I was wrong.  It has destroyed me.”",
        "“I don’t believe it is my picture.”",
        "“Can’t you see your romance in it?” said Dorian, bitterly.",
        "“My romance, as you call it . . .”",
        "“As you called it.”",
        "“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful.  This is the face of\na satyr.”",
        "“It is the face of my soul.”",
        "“God! what a thing I must have worshipped!  This has the eyes of a\ndevil.”",
        "“Each of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian, with a\nwild gesture of despair.",
        "Hallward turned again to the portrait, and gazed at it.  “My God! if\nit is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your\nlife, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you\nfancy you to be!”  He held the light up again to the canvas, and\nexamined it.  The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed, and as he\nhad left it.  It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and\nhorror had come.  Through some strange quickening of inner life the\nleprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away.  The rotting of a\ncorpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.",
        "His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor, and\nlay there sputtering.  He placed his foot on it and put it out.  Then\nhe flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the\ntable and buried his face in his hands.",
        "“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! what an awful lesson!”  There was\nno answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.",
        "“Pray, Dorian, pray,” he murmured.  “What is it that one was taught\nto say in one’s boyhood?  ’Lead us not into temptation.  Forgive us\nour sins.  Wash away our iniquities.’  Let us say that together.  The\nprayer of your pride has been answered.  The prayer of your\nrepentance will be answered also.  I worshipped you too much.  I am\npunished for it.  You worshipped yourself too much.  We are both\npunished.”",
        "Dorian Gray turned slowly around, and looked at him with tear-dimmed\neyes.  “It is too late, Basil,” he murmured.",
        "“It is never too late, Dorian.  Let us kneel down and try if we can\nremember a prayer.  Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ’Though your sins\nbe as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”",
        "[84] “Those words mean nothing to me now.”",
        "“Hush! don’t say that.  You have done enough evil in your life.  My\nGod! don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”",
        "Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable\nfeeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him.  The mad passions\nof a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was\nseated at the table, more than he had ever loathed anything in his\nwhole life.  He glanced wildly around.  Something glimmered on the\ntop of the painted chest that faced him.  His eye fell on it.  He\nknew what it was.  It was a knife that he had brought up, some days\nbefore, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with\nhim.  He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.  As\nsoon as he got behind him, he seized it, and turned round.  Hallward\nmoved in his chair as if he was going to rise.  He rushed at him, and\ndug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing\nthe man’s head down on the table, and stabbing again and again.",
        "There was a stifled groan, and the horrible sound of some one choking\nwith blood.  The outstretched arms shot up convulsively three times,\nwaving grotesque stiff-fingered hands in the air.  He stabbed him\nonce more, but the man did not move.  Something began to trickle on\nthe floor.  He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.\nThen he threw the knife on the table, and listened.",
        "He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.\nHe opened the door, and went out on the landing.  The house was quite\nquiet.  No one was stirring.",
        "He took out the key, and returned to the room, locking himself in as\nhe did so.",
        "The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table\nwith bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.  Had it\nnot been for the red jagged tear in the neck, and the clotted black\npool that slowly widened on the table, one would have said that the\nman was simply asleep.",
        "How quickly it had all been done!  He felt strangely calm, and,\nwalking over to the window, opened it, and stepped out on the\nbalcony.  The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a\nmonstrous peacock’s tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.  He\nlooked down, and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing a\nbull’s-eye lantern on the doors of the silent houses.  The crimson\nspot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner, and then vanished.\nA woman in a ragged shawl was creeping round by the railings,\nstaggering as she went.  Now and then she stopped, and peered back.\nOnce, she began to sing in a hoarse voice.  The policeman strolled\nover and said something to her.  She stumbled away, laughing.  A\nbitter blast swept across the Square.  The gas-lamps flickered, and\nbecame blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches\nas if in pain.  He shivered, and went back, closing the window behind\nhim.",
        "He passed to the door, turned the key, and opened it.  He did not\neven glance at the murdered man.  He felt that the secret of the\nwhole thing was not to realize the situation.  The friend who had\npainted [85] the fatal portrait, the portrait to which all his misery\nhad been due, had gone out of his life.  That was enough.",
        "Then he remembered the lamp.  It was a rather curious one of Moorish\nworkmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished\nsteel.  Perhaps it might be missed by his servant, and questions\nwould be asked.  He turned back, and took it from the table.  How\nstill the man was!  How horribly white the long hands looked!  He was\nlike a dreadful wax image.",
        "He locked the door behind him, and crept quietly down-stairs.  The\nwood-work creaked, and seemed to cry out as if in pain.  He stopped\nseveral times, and waited.  No: everything was still.  It was merely\nthe sound of his own footsteps.",
        "When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.\nThey must be hidden away somewhere.  He unlocked a secret press that\nwas in the wainscoting, and put them into it.  He could easily burn\nthem afterwards.  Then he pulled out his watch.  It was twenty\nminutes to two.",
        "He sat down, and began to think.  Every year–every month, almost–\nmen were strangled in England for what he had done.  There had been a\nmadness of murder in the air.  Some red star had come too close to\nthe earth.",
        "Evidence?  What evidence was there against him?  Basil Hallward had\nleft the house at eleven.  No one had seen him come in again.  Most\nof the servants were at Selby Royal.  His valet had gone to bed.",
        "Paris!  Yes.  It was to Paris that Basil had gone, by the midnight\ntrain, as he had intended.  With his curious reserved habits, it\nwould be months before any suspicions would be aroused.  Months?\nEverything could be destroyed long before then.",
        "A sudden thought struck him.  He put on his fur coat and hat, and\nwent out into the hall.  There he paused, hearing the slow heavy\ntread of the policeman outside on the pavement, and seeing the flash\nof the lantern reflected in the window.  He waited, holding his\nbreath.",
        "After a few moments he opened the front door, and slipped out,\nshutting it very gently behind him.  Then he began ringing the bell.\nIn about ten minutes his valet appeared, half dressed, and looking\nvery drowsy.",
        "“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping\nin; “but I had forgotten my latch-key.  What time is it?”",
        "“Five minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock\nand yawning.",
        "“Five minutes past two?  How horribly late!  You must wake me at nine\nto-morrow.  I have some work to do.”",
        "“All right, sir.”",
        "“Did any one call this evening?”",
        "“Mr. Hallward, sir.  He stayed here till eleven, and then he went\naway to catch his train.”",
        "“Oh!  I am sorry I didn’t see him.  Did he leave any message?”",
        "“No, sir, except that he would write to you.”",
        "[86] “That will do, Francis.  Don’t forget to call me at nine\ntomorrow.”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.",
        "Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the yellow marble table, and\npassed into the library.  He walked up and down the room for a\nquarter of an hour, biting his lip, and thinking.  Then he took the\nBlue Book down from one of the shelves, and began to turn over the\nleaves.  “Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair.”  Yes; that\nwas the man he wanted.",
        "At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a\ncup of chocolate on a tray, and opened the shutters.  Dorian was\nsleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand\nunderneath his cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out\nwith play, or study.",
        "The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as\nhe opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he\nhad been having some delightful dream.  Yet he had not dreamed at\nall.  His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of\npain.  But youth smiles without any reason.  It is one of its\nchiefest charms.",
        "He turned round, and, leaning on his elbow, began to drink his\nchocolate.  The mellow November sun was streaming into the room.  The\nsky was bright blue, and there was a genial warmth in the air.  It\nwas almost like a morning in May.",
        "Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent blood-\nstained feet into his brain, and reconstructed themselves there with\nterrible distinctness.  He winced at the memory of all that he had\nsuffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for\nBasil Hallward, that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair,\ncame back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was\nstill sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.  How horrible that\nwas!  Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.",
        "He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would\nsicken or grow mad.  There were sins whose fascination was more in\nthe memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified\nthe pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a\nquickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could\never bring, to the senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a\nthing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be\nstrangled lest it might strangle one itself.",
        "He passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up hastily, and\ndressed himself with even more than his usual attention, giving a\ngood deal of care to the selection of his necktie and scarf-pin, and\nchanging his rings more than once.",
        "He spent a long time over breakfast, tasting the various dishes,\ntalking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of\n[87] getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his\ncorrespondence.  Over some of the letters he smiled.  Three of them\nbored him.  One he read several times over, and then tore up with a\nslight look of annoyance in his face.  “That awful thing, a woman’s\nmemory!” as Lord Henry had once said.",
        "When he had drunk his coffee, he sat down at the table, and wrote two\nletters.  One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.",
        "“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr.\nCampbell is out of town, get his address.”",
        "As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette, and began sketching upon\na piece of paper, drawing flowers, and bits of architecture, first,\nand then faces.  Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew\nseemed to have an extraordinary likeness to Basil Hallward.  He\nfrowned, and, getting up, went over to the bookcase and took out a\nvolume at hazard.  He was determined that he would not think about\nwhat had happened, till it became absolutely necessary to do so.",
        "When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-\npage of the book.  It was Gautier’s “Emaux et Camées,” Charpentier’s\nJapanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.  The binding was\nof citron-green leather with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted\npomegranates.  It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.  As he\nturned over the pages his eye fell on the poem about the hand of\nLacenaire, the cold yellow hand “du supplice encore mal lavée,” with\nits downy red hairs and its “doigts de faune.”  He glanced at his own\nwhite taper fingers, and passed on, till he came to those lovely\nverses upon Venice:",
        "     Sur une gamme chromatique,\n        Le sein de perles ruisselant,\n     La Vénus de l’Adriatique\n        Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.\n\n     Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes\n        Suivant la phrase au pur contour,\n     S’enflent comme des gorges rondes\n        Que soulève un soupir d’amour.\n\n     L’esquif aborde et me dépose,\n        Jetant son amarre au pilier,\n     Devant une façade rose,\n        Sur le marbre d’un escalier.",
        "How exquisite they were!  As one read them, one seemed to be floating\ndown the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, lying in a\nblack gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.  The mere lines\nlooked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow\none as one pushes out to the Lido.  The sudden flashes of color\nreminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that\nflutter round the tall honey-combed Campanile, or stalk, with such\nstately grace, through the dim arcades.  Leaning back with half-\nclosed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself,–",
        "     Devant une façade rose,\n     Sur le marbre d’un escalier.",
        "[88] The whole of Venice was in those two lines.  He remembered the\nautumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had\nstirred him to delightful fantastic follies.  There was romance in\nevery place.  But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for\nromance, and background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil\nhad been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.\nPoor Basil! what a horrible way for a man to die!",
        "He sighed, and took up the book again, and tried to forget.  He read\nof the swallows that fly in and out of the little café at Smyrna\nwhere the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned\nmerchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each\nother; of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of\ngranite in its lonely sunless exile, and longs to be back by the hot\nlotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises,\nand white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles, with small\nberyl eyes, that crawl over the green steaming mud; and of that\ncurious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the\n\"monstre charmant” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.\nBut after a time the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous, and a\nhorrible fit of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should\nbe out of England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.\nPerhaps he might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every\nmoment was of vital importance.",
        "They had been great friends once, five years before,–almost\ninseparable, indeed.  Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.\nWhen they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:\nAlan Campbell never did.",
        "He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real\nappreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the\nbeauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.\nHis dominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he\nhad spent a great deal of his time working in the Laboratory, and had\ntaken a good class in the Natural Science tripos of his year.\nIndeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a\nlaboratory of his own, in which he used to shut himself up all day\nlong, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart\non his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist\nwas a person who made up prescriptions.  He was an excellent\nmusician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano\nbetter than most amateurs.  In fact, it was music that had first\nbrought him and Dorian Gray together,–music and that indefinable\nattraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he\nwished, and indeed exercised often without being conscious of it.\nThey had met at Lady Berkshire’s the night that Rubinstein played\nthere, and after that used to be always seen together at the Opera,\nand wherever good music was going on.  For eighteen months their\nintimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in\nGrosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the\ntype of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.\nWhether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever\nknew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when\n[89] they met, and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from\nany party at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too,–\nwas strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing\nmusic of any passionate character, and would never himself play,\ngiving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so\nabsorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.\nAnd this was certainly true.  Every day he seemed to become more\ninterested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some of\nthe scientific reviews, in connection with certain curious\nexperiments.",
        "This was the man that Dorian Gray was waiting for, pacing up and down\nthe room, glancing every moment at the clock, and becoming horribly\nagitated as the minutes went by.  At last the door opened, and his\nservant entered.",
        "“Mr. Alan Campbell, sir.”",
        "A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the color came back\nto his cheeks.",
        "“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.”",
        "The man bowed, and retired.  In a few moments Alan Campbell walked\nin, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified\nby his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.",
        "“Alan! this is kind of you.  I thank you for coming.”",
        "“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.  But you said\nit was a matter of life and death.”  His voice was hard and cold.  He\nspoke with slow deliberation.  There was a look of contempt in the\nsteady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian.  He kept his hands in\nthe pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and appeared not to have noticed\nthe gesture with which he had been greeted.",
        "“It is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person.\nSit down.”",
        "Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him.\nThe two men’s eyes met.  In Dorian’s there was infinite pity.  He\nknew that what he was going to do was dreadful.",
        "After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very\nquietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of the\nman he had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this\nhouse, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is\nseated at a table.  He has been dead ten hours now.  Don’t stir, and\ndon’t look at me like that.  Who the man is, why he died, how he\ndied, are matters that do not concern you.  What you have to do is\nthis–”",
        "“Stop, Gray.  I don’t want to know anything further.  Whether what\nyou have told me is true or not true, doesn’t concern me.  I entirely\ndecline to be mixed up in your life.  Keep your horrible secrets to\nyourself.  They don’t interest me any more.”",
        "“Alan, they will have to interest you.  This one will have to\ninterest you.  I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.  But I can’t help\nmyself.  You are the one man who is able to save me.  I am forced to\nbring you into the matter.  I have no option.  Alan, you are a\nscientist.  You know about chemistry, and things of that kind.  You\nhave made experiments.  What you have got to do is to destroy the\n[90] thing that is up-stairs,–to destroy it so that not a vestige\nwill be left of it.  Nobody saw this person come into the house.\nIndeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris.  He will\nnot be missed for months.  When he is missed, there must be no trace\nof him found here.  You, Alan, you must change him, and everything\nthat belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in\nthe air.”",
        "“You are mad, Dorian.”",
        "“Ah!  I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”",
        "“You are mad, I tell you,–mad to imagine that I would raise a finger\nto help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.  I will have\nnothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.  Do you think I am\ngoing to peril my reputation for you?  What is it to me what devil’s\nwork you are up to?”",
        "“It was a suicide, Alan.”",
        "“I am glad of that.  But who drove him to it?  You, I should fancy.”",
        "“Do you still refuse to do this, for me?”",
        "“Of course I refuse.  I will have absolutely nothing to do with it.\nI don’t care what shame comes on you.  You deserve it all.  I should\nnot be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced.  How dare you\nask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?  I\nshould have thought you knew more about people’s characters.  Your\nfriend Lord Henry Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology,\nwhatever else he has taught you.  Nothing will induce me to stir a\nstep to help you.  You have come to the wrong man.  Go to some of\nyour friends.  Don’t come to me.”",
        "“Alan, it was murder.  I killed him.  You don’t know what he had made\nme suffer.  Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or\nthe marring of it than poor Harry has had.  He may not have intended\nit, the result was the same.”",
        "“Murder!  Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?  I shall\nnot inform upon you.  It is not my business.  Besides, you are\ncertain to be arrested, without my stirring in the matter.  Nobody\never commits a murder without doing something stupid.  But I will\nhave nothing to do with it.”",
        "“All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.  You\ngo to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there\ndon’t affect you.  If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid\nlaboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red\ngutters scooped out in it, you would simply look upon him as an\nadmirable subject.  You would not turn a hair.  You would not believe\nthat you were doing anything wrong.  On the contrary, you would\nprobably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing\nthe sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual\ncuriosity, or something of that kind.  What I want you to do is\nsimply what you have often done before.  Indeed, to destroy a body\nmust be less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at.  And,\nremember, it is the only piece of evidence against me.  If it is\ndiscovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you\nhelp me.”",
        "[91] “I have no desire to help you.  You forget that.  I am simply\nindifferent to the whole thing.  It has nothing to do with me.”",
        "“Alan, I entreat you.  Think of the position I am in.  Just before\nyou came I almost fainted with terror.  No! don’t think of that.\nLook at the matter purely from the scientific point of view.  You\ndon’t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come\nfrom.  Don’t inquire now.  I have told you too much as it is.  But I\nbeg of you to do this.  We were friends once, Alan.”",
        "“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian: they are dead.”",
        "“The dead linger sometimes.  The man up-stairs will not go away.  He\nis sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.  Alan!\nAlan! if you don’t come to my assistance I am ruined.  Why, they will\nhang me, Alan!  Don’t you understand?  They will hang me for what I\nhave done.”",
        "“There is no good in prolonging this scene.  I refuse absolutely to\ndo anything in the matter.  It is insane of you to ask me.”",
        "“You refuse absolutely?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "The same look of pity came into Dorian’s eyes, then he stretched out\nhis hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.  He read\nit over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.\nHaving done this, he got up, and went over to the window.",
        "Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and\nopened it.  As he read it, his face became ghastly pale, and he fell\nback in his chair.  A horrible sense of sickness came over him.  He\nfelt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty\nhollow.",
        "After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round,\nand came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.",
        "“I am so sorry, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no alternative.\nI have a letter written already.  Here it is.  You see the address.\nIf you don’t help me, I must send it.  You know what the result will\nbe.  But you are going to help me.  It is impossible for you to\nrefuse now.  I tried to spare you.  You will do me the justice to\nadmit that.  You were stern, harsh, offensive.  You treated me as no\nman has ever dared to treat me,–no living man, at any rate.  I bore\nit all.  Now it is for me to dictate terms.”",
        "Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through\nhim.",
        "“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan.  You know what they are.\nThe thing is quite simple.  Come, don’t work yourself into this\nfever.  The thing has to be done.  Face it, and do it.”",
        "A groan broke from Campbell’s lips, and he shivered all over.  The\nticking of the clock on the mantel-piece seemed to him to be dividing\ntime into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to\nbe borne.  He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened\nround his forehead, and as if the disgrace with which he was\nthreatened had already come upon him.  The hand upon his shoulder\nweighed like a hand of lead.  It was intolerable.  It seemed to crush\nhim.",
        "“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”",
        "[92] He hesitated a moment.  “Is there a fire in the room up-stairs?\"\nhe murmured.",
        "“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”",
        "“I will have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”",
        "“No, Alan, you need not leave the house.  Write on a sheet of note-\npaper what you want, and my servant will take a cab and bring the\nthings back to you.”",
        "Campbell wrote a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope\nto his assistant.  Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.\nThen he rang the bell, and gave it to his valet, with orders to\nreturn as soon as possible, and to bring the things with him.",
        "When the hall door shut, Campbell started, and, having got up from\nthe chair, went over to the chimney-piece.  He was shivering with a\nsort of ague.  For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke.\nA fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was\nlike the beat of a hammer.",
        "As the chime struck one, Campbell turned around, and, looking at\nDorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.  There was\nsomething in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed\nto enrage him.  “You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered.",
        "“Hush, Alan: you have saved my life,” said Dorian.",
        "“Your life?  Good heavens! what a life that is!  You have gone from\ncorruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.  In\ndoing what I am going to do, what you force me to do, it is not of\nyour life that I am thinking.”",
        "“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian, with a sigh, “I wish you had a\nthousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you.”  He turned\naway, as he spoke, and stood looking out at the garden.  Campbell\nmade no answer.",
        "After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant\nentered, carrying a mahogany chest of chemicals, with a small\nelectric battery set on top of it.  He placed it on the table, and\nwent out again, returning with a long coil of steel and platinum wire\nand two rather curiously-shaped iron clamps.",
        "“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.",
        "“Yes,” said Dorian.  “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another\nerrand for you.  What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies\nSelby with orchids?”",
        "“Harden, sir.”",
        "“Yes,–Harden.  You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden\npersonally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,\nand to have as few white ones as possible.  In fact, I don’t want any\nwhite ones.  It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very\npretty place, otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”",
        "“No trouble, sir.  At what time shall I be back?”",
        "Dorian looked at Campbell.  “How long will your experiment take,\nAlan?” he said, in a calm, indifferent voice.  The presence of a\nthird person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.",
        "Campbell frowned, and bit his lip.  “It will take about five hours,\"\nhe answered.",
        "[93] “It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past\nseven, Francis.  Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing.  You\ncan have the evening to yourself.  I am not dining at home, so I\nshall not want you.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.",
        "“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost.  How heavy this chest\nis!  I’ll take it for you.  You bring the other things.”  He spoke\nrapidly, and in an authoritative manner.  Campbell felt dominated by\nhim.  They left the room together.",
        "When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned\nit in the lock.  Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his\neyes.  He shuddered.  “I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.",
        "“It is nothing to me.  I don’t require you,” said Campbell, coldly.",
        "Dorian half opened the door.  As he did so, he saw the face of the\nportrait grinning in the sunlight.  On the floor in front of it the\ntorn curtain was lying.  He remembered that the night before, for the\nfirst time in his life, he had forgotten to hide it, when he crept\nout of the room.",
        "But what was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening,\non one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?  How\nhorrible it was!–more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment,\nthan the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table,\nthe thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet\nshowed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had\nleft it.",
        "He opened the door a little wider, and walked quickly in, with half-\nclosed eyes and averted head, determined that he would not look even\nonce upon the dead man.  Then, stooping down, and taking up the gold-\nand-purple hanging, he flung it over the picture.",
        "He stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed\nthemselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him.  He heard\nCampbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other\nthings that he had required for his dreadful work.  He began to\nwonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they\nhad thought of each other.",
        "“Leave me now,” said Campbell.",
        "He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been\nthrust back into the chair and was sitting up in it, with Campbell\ngazing into the glistening yellow face.  As he was going downstairs\nhe heard the key being turned in the lock.",
        "It was long after seven o’clock when Campbell came back into the\nlibrary.  He was pale, but absolutely calm.  “I have done what you\nasked me to do,” he muttered.  “And now, good-by.  Let us never see\neach other again.”",
        "“You have saved me from ruin, Alan.  I cannot forget that,” said\nDorian, simply.",
        "As soon as Campbell had left, he went up-stairs.  There was a\nhorrible smell of chemicals in the room.  But the thing that had been\nsitting at the table was gone.",
        "“There is no good telling me you are going to be good, Dorian,\"\ncried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl\nfilled with rose-water.  “You are quite perfect.  Pray don’t change.”",
        "Dorian shook his head.  “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful\nthings in my life.  I am not going to do any more.  I began my good\nactions yesterday.”",
        "“Where were you yesterday?”",
        "“In the country, Harry.  I was staying at a little inn by myself.”",
        "“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry smiling, “anybody can be good in the\ncountry.  There are no temptations there.  That is the reason why\npeople who live out of town are so uncivilized.  There are only two\nways, as you know, of becoming civilized.  One is by being cultured,\nthe other is by being corrupt.  Country-people have no opportunity of\nbeing either, so they stagnate.”",
        "“Culture and corruption,” murmured Dorian.  “I have known something\nof both.  It seems to me curious now that they should ever be found\ntogether.  For I have a new ideal, Harry.  I am going to alter.  I\nthink I have altered.”",
        "“You have not told me yet what your good action was.  Or did you say\nyou had done more than one?”",
        "“I can tell you, Harry.  It is not a story I could tell to any one\nelse.  I spared somebody.  It sounds vain, but you understand what I\nmean.  She was quite beautiful, and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane.  I\nthink it was that which first attracted me to her.  You remember\nSibyl, don’t you?  How long ago that seems!  Well, Hetty was not one\nof our own class, of course.  She was simply a girl in a village.\nBut I really loved her.  I am quite sure that I loved her.  All\nduring this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run\ndown and see her two or three times a week.  Yesterday she met me in\na little orchard.  The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair,\nand she was laughing.  We were to have gone away together this\nmorning at dawn.  Suddenly I determined to leave her as flower-like\nas I had found her.”",
        "“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a\nthrill of real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry.  “But I can\nfinish your idyl for you.  You gave her good advice, and broke her\nheart.  That was the beginning of your reformation.”",
        "“Harry, you are horrible!  You mustn’t say these dreadful things.\nHetty’s heart is not broken.  Of course she cried, and all that.  But\nthere is no disgrace upon her.  She can live, like Perdita, in her\ngarden.”",
        "“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing.  “My\ndear Dorian, you have the most curious boyish moods.  Do you think\nthis girl will ever be really contented now with any one of her own\nrank?  I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a\ngrinning ploughman.  Well, having met you, and loved you, will teach\nher to despise her husband, and she will be wretched.  From a moral\npoint of view I really don’t think much of your great renunciation.\n[95] Even as a beginning, it is poor.  Besides, how do you know that\nHetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some mill-pond, with\nwater-lilies round her, like Ophelia?”",
        "“I can’t bear this, Harry!  You mock at everything, and then suggest\nthe most serious tragedies.  I am sorry I told you now.  I don’t care\nwhat you say to me, I know I was right in acting as I did.  Poor\nHetty!  As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at\nthe window, like a spray of jasmine.  Don’t let me talk about it any\nmore, and don’t try to persuade me that the first good action I have\ndone for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever\nknown, is really a sort of sin.  I want to be better.  I am going to\nbe better.  Tell me something about yourself.  What is going on in\ntown?  I have not been to the club for days.”",
        "“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”",
        "“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,” said\nDorian, pouring himself out some wine, and frowning slightly.",
        "“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and\nthe public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more\nthan one topic every three months.  They have been very fortunate\nlately, however.  They have had my own divorce-case, and Alan\nCampbell’s suicide.  Now they have got the mysterious disappearance\nof an artist.  Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the gray\nulster who left Victoria by the midnight train on the 7th of November\nwas poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never\narrived in Paris at all.  I suppose in about a fortnight we will be\ntold that he has been seen in San Francisco.  It is an odd thing, but\nevery one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.  It\nmust be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the\nnext world.”",
        "“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up\nhis Burgundy against the light, and wondering how it was that he\ncould discuss the matter so calmly.",
        "“I have not the slightest idea.  If Basil chooses to hide himself, it\nis no business of mine.  If he is dead, I don’t want to think about\nhim.  Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.  I hate it.\nOne can survive everything nowadays except that.  Death and vulgarity\nare the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot\nexplain away.  Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian.  You\nmust play Chopin to me.  The man with whom my wife ran away played\nChopin exquisitely.  Poor Victoria!  I was very fond of her.  The\nhouse is rather lonely without her.”",
        "Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and, passing into the\nnext room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the\nkeys.  After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped, and, looking\nover at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil\nwas murdered?”",
        "Lord Henry yawned.  “Basil had no enemies, and always wore a\nWaterbury watch.  Why should he be murdered?  He was not clever\nenough to have enemies.  Of course he had a wonderful genius for\npainting.  But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as\npossible.  Basil was really rather dull.  He only interested me once,\n[96] and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild\nadoration for you.”",
        "“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian, with a sad look in his eyes.\n\"But don’t people say that he was murdered?”",
        "“Oh, some of the papers do.  It does not seem to be probable.  I know\nthere are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man\nto have gone to them.  He had no curiosity.  It was his chief defect.\nPlay me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low\nvoice, how you have kept your youth.  You must have some secret.  I\nam only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and bald,\nand yellow.  You are really wonderful, Dorian.  You have never looked\nmore charming than you do to-night.  You remind me of the day I saw\nyou first.  You were rather cheeky, very shy, and absolutely\nextraordinary.  You have changed, of course, but not in appearance.\nI wish you would tell me your secret.  To get back my youth I would\ndo anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be\nrespectable.  Youth!  There is nothing like it.  It’s absurd to talk\nof the ignorance of youth.  The only people whose opinions I listen\nto now with any respect are people much younger than myself.  They\nseem in front of me.  Life has revealed to them her last wonder.  As\nfor the aged, I always contradict the aged.  I do it on principle.\nIf you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday,\nthey solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore\nhigh stocks and knew absolutely nothing.  How lovely that thing you\nare playing is!  I wonder did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the\nsea weeping round the villa, and the salt spray dashing against the\npanes?  It is marvelously romantic.  What a blessing it is that there\nis one art left to us that is not imitative!  Don’t stop.  I want\nmusic to-night.  It seems to me that you are the young Apollo, and\nthat I am Marsyas listening to you.  I have sorrows, Dorian, of my\nown, that even you know nothing of.  The tragedy of old age is not\nthat one is old, but that one is young.  I am amazed sometimes at my\nown sincerity.  Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!  What an exquisite\nlife you have had!  You have drunk deeply of everything.  You have\ncrushed the grapes against your palate.  Nothing has been hidden from\nyou.  But it has all been to you no more than the sound of music.  It\nhas not marred you.  You are still the same.",
        "“I wonder what the rest of your life will be.  Don’t spoil it by\nrenunciations.  At present you are a perfect type.  Don’t make\nyourself incomplete.  You are quite flawless now.  You need not shake\nyour head: you know you are.  Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive\nyourself.  Life is not governed by will or intention.  Life is a\nquestion of nerves, and fibres, and slowly-built-up cells in which\nthought hides itself and passion has its dreams.  You may fancy\nyourself safe, and think yourself strong.  But a chance tone of color\nin a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once\nloved and that brings strange memories with it, a line from a\nforgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece\nof music that you had ceased to play,–I tell you, Dorian, that it is\non things like these that our lives depend.  Browning writes about\nthat somewhere; but our [97] own senses will imagine them for us.\nThere are moments when the odor of heliotrope passes suddenly across\nme, and I have to live the strangest year of my life over again.",
        "“I wish I could change places with you, Dorian.  The world has cried\nout against us both, but it has always worshipped you.  It always\nwill worship you.  You are the type of what the age is searching for,\nand what it is afraid it has found.  I am so glad that you have never\ndone anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or\nproduced anything outside of yourself!  Life has been your art.  You\nhave set yourself to music.  Your days have been your sonnets.”",
        "Dorian rose up from the piano, and passed his hand through his hair.\n\"Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to\nhave the same life, Harry.  And you must not say these extravagant\nthings to me.  You don’t know everything about me.  I think that if\nyou did, even you would turn from me.  You laugh.  Don’t laugh.”",
        "“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?  Go back and play the nocturne\nover again.  Look at that great honey-colored moon that hangs in the\ndusky air.  She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she\nwill come closer to the earth.  You won’t?  Let us go to the club,\nthen.  It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly.\nThere is some one at the club who wants immensely to know you,–young\nLord Poole, Bournmouth’s eldest son.  He has already copied your\nneckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you.  He is quite\ndelightful, and rather reminds me of you.”",
        "“I hope not,” said Dorian, with a touch of pathos in his voice.  “But\nI am tired to-night, Harry.  I won’t go to the club.  It is nearly\neleven, and I want to go to bed early.”",
        "“Do stay.  You have never played so well as to-night.  There was\nsomething in your touch that was wonderful.  It had more expression\nthan I had ever heard from it before.”",
        "“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling.  “I am a\nlittle changed already.”",
        "“Don’t change, Dorian; at any rate, don’t change to me.  We must\nalways be friends.”",
        "“Yet you poisoned me with a book once.  I should not forgive that.\nHarry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one.  It\ndoes harm.”",
        "“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.  You will soon be\ngoing about warning people against all the sins of which you have\ngrown tired.  You are much too delightful to do that.  Besides, it is\nno use.  You and I are what we are, and will be what we will be.\nCome round tomorrow.  I am going to ride at eleven, and we might go\ntogether.  The Park is quite lovely now.  I don’t think there have\nbeen such lilacs since the year I met you.”",
        "“Very well.  I will be here at eleven,” said Dorian.  “Good-night,\nHarry.”  As he reached the door he hesitated for a moment, as if he\nhad something more to say.  Then he sighed and went out.",
        "It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm,\nand did not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled\n[98] home, smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress\npassed him.  He heard one of them whisper to the other, “That is\nDorian Gray.”  He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was\npointed out, or stared at, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing\nhis own name now.  Half the charm of the little village where he had\nbeen so often lately was that no one knew who he was.  He had told\nthe girl whom he had made love him that he was poor, and she had\nbelieved him.  He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had\nlaughed at him, and told him that wicked people were always very old\nand very ugly.  What a laugh she had!–just like a thrush singing.\nAnd how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!\nShe knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.",
        "When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He\nsent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library,\nand began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said\nto him.",
        "Was it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild\nlonging for the unstained purity of his boyhood,–his rose-white\nboyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had\ntarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption, and given horror\nto his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had\nexperienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that\nhad crossed his own it had been the fairest and the most full of\npromise that he had brought to shame.  But was it all irretrievable?\nWas there no hope for him?",
        "It was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.\nIt was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  Alan\nCampbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not\nrevealed the secret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement,\nsuch as it was, over Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass\naway.  It was already waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor,\nindeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his\nmind.  It was the living death of his own soul that troubled him.\nBasil had painted the portrait that had marred his life.  He could\nnot forgive him that.  It was the portrait that had done everything.\nBasil had said things to him that were unbearable, and that he had\nyet borne with patience.  The murder had been simply the madness of a\nmoment.  As for Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own act.  He\nhad chosen to do it.  It was nothing to him.",
        "A new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting\nfor.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent\nthing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would\nbe good.",
        "As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\nthe locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as\nit had been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to\nexpel every sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of\nevil had already gone away.  He would go and look.",
        "He took the lamp from the table and crept up-stairs.  As he unlocked\nthe door, a smile of joy flitted across his young face and [99]\nlingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and the\nhideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to\nhim.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.",
        "He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom,\nand dragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and\nindignation broke from him.  He could see no change, unless that in\nthe eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved\nwrinkle of the hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome,–more\nloathsome, if possible, than before,–and the scarlet dew that\nspotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilt.",
        "Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or\nthe desire of a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his\nmocking laugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us\ndo things finer than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?",
        "Why was the red stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have\ncrept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was\nblood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped,–blood\neven on the hand that had not held the knife.",
        "Confess?  Did it mean that he was to confess?  To give himself up,\nand be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt that the idea was\nmonstrous.  Besides, who would believe him, even if he did confess?\nThere was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.  Everything\nbelonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned what had\nbeen below-stairs.  The world would simply say he was mad.  They\nwould shut him up if he persisted in his story.",
        "Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make\npublic atonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their\nsins to earth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would\ncleanse him till he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his\nshoulders.  The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.\nHe was thinking of Hetty Merton.",
        "It was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking\nat.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there been nothing more in\nhis renunciation than that?  There had been something more.  At least\nhe thought so.  But who could tell?",
        "And this murder,–was it to dog him all his life?  Was he never to\nget rid of the past?  Was he really to confess?  No.  There was only\none bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself,–that was\nevidence.",
        "He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  It had given him\npleasure once to watch it changing and growing old.  Of late he had\nfelt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.  When he had\nbeen away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look\nupon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.  Its mere\nmemory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like conscience\nto him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.",
        "He looked round, and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.\nHe had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.\nIt was bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it\n[100] would kill the painter’s work, and all that that meant.  It\nwould kill the past, and when that was dead he would be free.  He\nseized it, and stabbed the canvas with it, ripping the thing right up\nfrom top to bottom.",
        "There was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its\nagony that the frightened servants woke, and crept out of their\nrooms.  Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square below, stopped,\nand looked up at the great house.  They walked on till they met a\npoliceman, and brought him back.  The man rang the bell several\ntimes, but there was no answer.  The house was all dark, except for a\nlight in one of the top windows.  After a time, he went away, and\nstood in the portico of the next house and watched.",
        "“Whose house is that, constable?” asked the elder of the two\ngentlemen.",
        "“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.",
        "They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle.",
        "Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics\nwere talking in low whispers to each other.  Old Mrs. Leaf was\ncrying, and wringing her hands.  Francis was as pale as death.",
        "After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\nfootmen and crept up-stairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply.\nThey called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying\nto force the door, they got on the roof, and dropped down on to the\nbalcony.  The windows yielded easily: the bolts were old.",
        "When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid\nportrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder\nof his exquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead\nman, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered,\nwrinkled, and loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined\nthe rings that they recognized who it was.",
