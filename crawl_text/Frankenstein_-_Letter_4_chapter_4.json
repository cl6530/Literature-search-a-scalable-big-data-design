        "To Mrs. Saville, England",
        "August 5th, 17-",
        "So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\nthese papers can come into your possession.",
        "Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\nshe floated.  Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",
        "About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\nhave no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\nsituation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\ndistant inequalities of the ice.  This appearance excited our\nunqualified wonder.  We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from\nany land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in\nreality, so distant as we had supposed.  Shut in, however, by ice, it\nwas impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\ngreatest attention.  About two hours after this occurrence we heard the\nground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.  We,\nhowever, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark\nthose large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the\nice.  I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.",
        "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\ntalking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\nfragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\nsome undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\non the open sea.”",
        "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\nforeign accent.  “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will\nyou have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”",
        "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\nnorthern pole.",
        "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\nGood God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  His limbs were\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\nsuffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\nair he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\nswallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\nkitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\nwhich restored him wonderfully.",
        "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  When he\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more\ninteresting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him the most trifling\nservice, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam\nof benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he is\ngenerally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.",
        "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the\nmen, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow\nhim to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and\nmind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.  Once,\nhowever, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so\nstrange a vehicle.",
        "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”",
        "“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”",
        "This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had\npursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”",
        "“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”",
        "“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\nbenevolently restored me to life.”",
        "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\nice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new\nspirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.  He\nmanifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the\nsledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the\natmosphere.  I have promised that someone should watch for him and give\nhim instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.",
        "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\npresent day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. \nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\nwith him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\nso attractive and amiable.  I said in one of my letters, my dear\nMargaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have\nfound a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should\nhave been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.",
        "I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.",
        "My affection for my guest increases every day.  He excites at once my\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.  How can I see so\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\ngrief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.  He is now much\nrecovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently\nwatching for the sledge that preceded his own.  Yet, although unhappy,\nhe is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests\nhimself deeply in the projects of others.  He has frequently conversed\nwith me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.  He\nentered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual\nsuccess and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to\nsecure it.  I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use\nthe language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my\nsoul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I\nwould sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the\nfurtherance of my enterprise.  One man’s life or death were but a small\nprice to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for\nthe dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of\nour race.  As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s\ncountenance.  At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his\nemotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and\nfailed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a\ngroan burst from his heaving breast.  I paused; at length he spoke, in\nbroken accents:  “Unhappy man!  Do you share my madness?  Have you\ndrunk also of the intoxicating draught?  Hear me; let me reveal my\ntale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”",
        "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\nnecessary to restore his composure.  Having conquered the violence of\nhis feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of\npassion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to\nconverse concerning myself personally.  He asked me the history of my\nearlier years.  The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various\ntrains of reflection.  I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my\nthirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever\nfallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of\nlittle happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.  “I agree with you,\"\nreplied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up,\nif one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves–such a friend ought to\nbe–do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I\nonce had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled,\ntherefore, to judge respecting friendship.  You have hope, and the\nworld before you, and have no cause for despair.  But I–I have lost\neverything and cannot begin life anew.”",
        "As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\ngrief that touched me to the heart.  But he was silent and presently\nretired to his cabin.",
        "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\ndoes the beauties of nature.  The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\nelevating his soul from earth.  Such a man has a double existence:  he\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",
        "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\nwanderer?  You would not if you saw him.  You have been tutored and\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.  Sometimes I\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.  I\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",
        "Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.  I had\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination.  You seek for\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\nhas been.  I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\nin case of failure.  Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\ndeemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”",
        "You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\na recital of his misfortunes.  I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.  I expressed\nthese feelings in my answer.",
        "“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my\nfate is nearly fulfilled.  I wait but for one event, and then I shall\nrepose in peace.  I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving\nthat I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if\nthus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny;\nlisten to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\ndetermined.”",
        "He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when\nI should be at leisure.  This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.\nI have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my\nduties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has\nrelated during the day.  If I should be engaged, I will at least make\nnotes.  This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest\npleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own\nlips–with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future\nday!  Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in\nmy ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy\nsweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the\nlineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.",
        "Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it–thus!",
