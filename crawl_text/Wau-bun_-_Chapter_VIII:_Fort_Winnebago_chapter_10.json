        "Major and Mrs. Twiggs, and a few of the younger officers (for nearly all\nof the older ones were absent), with our brother Robert, or, as he is\ncalled throughout all the Indian tribes, “Bob,” gave us a cordial\nwelcome–how cordial those alone can know who have come, like us, to a\nremote, isolated home in the wilderness. The Major insisted on our\ntaking possession at once of vacant quarters in the fort, instead of at\n“the Agency,” as had been proposed.",
        "“No–we must be under the same roof with them. Mrs. Twiggs had been\nwithout a companion of her own sex for more than four months, and would\ncertainly not hear of a separation now. But we must be their guests\nuntil the arrival of the boats containing our furniture,” which, under\nthe care of our old acquaintance, Hamilton Arndt, was making its way\nslowly up from Green Bay.",
        "A dinner had been prepared for us. This is one of the advantages of the\nzigzag approach by the Fox River–travellers never take their friends by\nsurprise; and when the whole circle sat down to the hospitable board, we\nwere indeed a merry company.",
        "After dinner Mrs. Twiggs showed me the quarters assigned to us, on the\nopposite side of the spacious hall. They consisted of two large rooms on\neach of the three floors or stories of the building. On the ground-floor\nthe front room was vacant. The one in the rear was to be the\nsleeping-apartment, as was evident from a huge, unwieldy bedstead, of\nproportions amply sufficient to have accommodated Og, the King of\nBashan, with Mrs. Og and the children into the bargain. We could not\nrepress our laughter; but the bedstead was nothing to another structure\nwhich occupied a second corner of the apartment.",
        "This edifice had been built under the immediate superintendence of one\nof our young lieutenants, and it was plain to be seen that upon it both\nhe and the soldiers who fabricated it had exhausted all their\narchitectural skill. The timbers of which it was composed had been\ngrooved and carved; the pillars that supported the front swelled in and\nout in a most fanciful manner; the doors were not only panelled, but\nradiated in a way to excite the admiration of all unsophisticated eyes.\nA similar piece of workmanship had been erected in each set of quarters,\nto supply the deficiency of closets, an inconvenience which had never\noccurred, until too late, to the bachelors who planned them. The three\napartments of which each structure was composed, were unquestionably\ndesigned for clothes-press, store-room, and china-closet; such, at\nleast, were the uses to which Mrs. Twiggs had appropriated the one\nassigned to her. There was this slight difficulty, that in the latter\nthe shelves were too close to admit of setting in even a gravy-boat, but\nthey made up in number what was wanting in space. We christened the\nwhole affair, in honor of its projector, a “Davis,” thus placing the\nfirst laurel on the brow of one who was afterwards to signalize himself\nin Cabinet making of quite a different character.",
        "The bold promontory on which Fort Winnebago was built looked down upon\nthe extended prairie and the Fox River on one side, and on the other\nstretched away into the thickly-wooded ridge that led off to Belle\nFontaine and Lake Puckaway.",
        "In front lay an extent of meadow, across which was the Portage road, of\nabout two miles in length, leading between the Fox and the Wisconsin\nRivers. Teams of oxen and a driver were kept at the Agency by the\nGovernment, to transport the canoes of the Indians across this place,\nwhich at many seasons was wet, miry, and almost impassable.",
        "The woods were now brilliant with the many tints of autumn, and the\nscene around was further enlivened by groups of Indians, in all\ndirections, and their lodges, which were scattered here and there, in\nthe vicinity of the Agency buildings. On the low grounds might be seen\nthe white tents of the traders, already prepared to furnish winter\nsupplies to the Indians, in exchange for the annuity money they were\nabout to receive.",
        "A great concourse had been for many days assembling in anticipation of\nthe payment, which was expected to take place as soon as Shaw-nee-aw-kee\nshould arrive with the silver.",
        "Preparatory to this event, the great chief of the nation, Four-Legs,\nwhose village we had passed at the entrance to Winnebago Lake, had\nthought proper to take a little carouse, as is too apt to be the custom\nwhen the savages come into the neighborhood of a sutler’s establishment.\nIn the present instance, the facilities for a season of intoxication had\nbeen augmented by the presence on the ground of some traders, too\nregardless of the very stringent laws prohibiting the sale of liquor to\nthe Indians.",
        "Poor Four-Legs could not stand this full tide of prosperity. Unchecked\nby the presence of his Father, the agent, he carried his indulgence to\nsuch excess that he fell a victim in the course of a few days. His\nfuneral had been celebrated with unusual pomp the day before our\narrival, and great was my disappointment at finding myself too late to\nwitness all the ceremonies.",
        "His body, according to their custom, having been wrapped in a blanket,\nand placed in a rude coffin, along with his guns, tomahawk, pipes, and a\nquantity of tobacco, had been carried to the most elevated point of the\nhill opposite the fort, followed by an immense procession of his people,\nwhooping, beating their drums, howling, and making altogether what is\nemphatically termed a ’pow-wow“",
        "After the interment of the body, a stake was planted at its head, on\nwhich was painted in vermilion a series of hieroglyphics, descriptive of\nthe great deeds and events of his life The whole was then surrounded\nwith pickets of the trunks of the tamarack-trees, and hither the friends\nwould come for many successive days to renew the expression of their\ngrief, and to throw over the grave tobacco and other offerings to the\nGreat Spirit.",
        "It was a consolation to find that, although delayed, we were yet in time\nto furnish a quantity of white cotton for a flag to wave over the grave,\nand also to pay a considerable bill at the sutler’s for the different\narticles that had been found necessary for the funeral parade–it being\na duty expected of their Father to bury the dead suitably.",
        "The funeral observances in honor of the chief had not yet ceased.\nThroughout the day, and all that night, the sound of instruments,\nmingled with doleful lamentations, and with the discordant whoops and\nyells of those in a partial state of intoxication, filled the air, and\ndisturbed our repose. To these were added occasionally the plaintive\nsounds of the Indian flute, upon which the young savage plays when he is\nin love. Grief and whiskey had made their hearts tender, and the woods\nresounded to their melancholy strains.",
        "Early the following morning, before I left my room, I was startled by\nthe sounds of lamentation and woe proceeding from the adjoining\napartment. On entering it, I found several squaws seated on the floor,\nwith downcast looks expressive of condolence and sympathy, while in\ntheir midst sat a little ugly woman, in tattered garments, with\nblackened face and dishevelled hair, sobbing and wailing bitterly.",
        "Not doubting they were the family of the deceased chief, I was quite\ntroubled at my inability to express, otherwise than by gestures, my\nparticipation in their sorrows.",
        "Unacquainted as I was with their customs, I took it for granted from\ntheir wretched appearance that poverty and destitution formed one of the\nsources of their affliction. One of the party, at least, seemed in the\nvery depths of misery. “Can it be possible,” said I to myself, “that\nthis poor creature has only these scanty rags to cover her?”",
        "Stepping back to my own room, I brought out a pretty calico wrapper,\nwhich I presented to the little, dirty, blackened object. She took it,\nand commenced a fresh series of sobbing and sighing. I made signs to her\nto put it on, opening it and explaining to her how it was to be worn,\nand recommending to her, by gestures, to lose no time in making herself\nmore comfortable.",
        "At this, the other women burst into a laugh.",
        "“Very mal-à-propos,” thought I, “and somewhat unfeeling.” At that moment\nmy husband, entering, explained to me that the chief mourner was Madame\nFour-Legs, the widow; that she had undoubtedly a comfortable wardrobe at\nhome, but that it was part of the etiquette of mourning to go for a\nseason with neglected persons and blackened faces. All this was told me\nin the intervals of shaking hands, and offering and receiving\ncondolences in the most uncouth, guttural language I had ever heard.\nTheir Father at length dismissed them, with a promise of some presents\nto help dry up their tears. It must not be inferred that the grief of\nthe poor little widow was not sincere. On the contrary, she was greatly\nattached to her husband, and had had great influence not only with him\nbut with the nation at large. She was a Fox woman, and spoke the\nChippewa, which is the court language among all the tribes, so that she\nwas often called upon to act as interpreter, and had, in fact, been in\nthe habit of accompanying her husband, and assisting him by her counsels\nupon all occasions. She was a person of great shrewdness and judgment,\nand, as I afterwards experienced, of strong and tenacious affections.",
        "After breakfast I received a visit from the principal chiefs, who had\nput on their best of apparel and paint to receive their new mother.",
        "There was Naw-kaw, or Kar-ray-mau-nee, “the Walking Turtle,” now the\nprincipal chief of the nation, a stalwart Indian, with a broad, pleasant\ncountenance, the great peculiarity of which was an immense under lip,\nhanging nearly to his chin. There was the old Day-kau-ray, the most\nnoble, dignified, and venerable of his own, or indeed of any tribe. His\nfine Roman countenance, rendered still more striking by his bald head,\nwith one solitary tuft of long silvery hair neatly tied and falling back\non his shoulders; his perfectly neat, appropriate dress, almost without\nornament, and his courteous demeanor, never laid aside under any\ncircumstances, all combined to give him the highest place in the\nconsideration of all who knew him. It will hereafter be seen that his\ntraits of character were not less grand and striking than were his\npersonal appearance and deportment.",
        "There was Black-Wolf, whose lowering, surly face was well described by\nhis name. The fierce expression of his countenance was greatly\nheightened by the masses of heavy black hair hanging round it, quite\ncontrary to the usual fashion among the Winnebagoes. They, for the most\npart, remove a portion of their hair, the remainder of which is drawn to\nthe back of the head, clubbed and ornamented with beads, ribbons, cock’s\nfeathers, or, if they are so entitled, an eagle’s feather for every\nscalp taken from an enemy.",
        "There was Talk-English, a remarkably handsome, powerful young Indian,\nwho received his name in the following manner. He was one of a party of\nsixteen Winnebagoes who had, by invitation, accompanied their Agent and\nMajor Forsyth (or the Chippewa, as he was called) on a visit to the\nPresident at Washington, the year previous.",
        "On the journey, the question naturally addressed to them by people not\nfamiliar with Western Indians was,–",
        "“Do you talk English?”",
        "The young fellow, being very observant, came to his Father. “What do\nthey mean by this? Everybody says to me, talk English!“",
        "The Agent interpreted the words to him. “Ah, very well.”",
        "The next place they arrived at was Lockport, in the State of New York.\nJumping off the canal-boat upon the lock, he ran up to the first man he\nmet, and, thrusting forward his face, cried out, “Talk Eengeesh?”",
        "“Yes,” said the man; “do you talk English?”",
        "“Ya-as.”",
        "From that time forward he always bore the name of Talk-English, and\nwas registered on the pay-rolls by a title of which he was not a little\nproud.",
        "Hoo-wau-ne-kah, “the Little Elk,” was another of the distinguished men\nof the tribe. He had likewise been at Washington. Henry Clay, when he\nvisited them, after looking carefully at the countenances and bearing\nof all the members of the deputation, had indicated him as the one\npossessing the greatest talent; and he was greatly pleased when informed\nthat he was the principal orator of the nation, and decidedly superior\nin abilities to any other individual of the tribe.",
        "Wild-Cat, our Indian Falstaff in all save the cowardice and falsehood, I\nhave already mentioned.",
        "Then there was Kau-ray-kaw-saw-kaw, “the White Crow,” a Rock River\nIndian, who afterwards distinguished himself as the friend of the whites\nduring the Sauk war. He was called by the French “le Borgne,” from\nhaving lost an eye; and the black silk handkerchief which he wore\ndrooping over the left side of his face to disguise the blemish, taken\nwith his native costume, gave him a very singular appearance.",
        "There was a nephew of the defunct chief Four-Legs, to whom with justice\nwas given, by both whites and Indians, the appellation of “the Dandy.\"\nWhen out of mourning his dress was of the most studied and fanciful\ncharacter. A shirt (when he condescended to wear any) of the brightest\ncolors, ornamented with innumerable rows of silver brooches set thickly\ntogether; never less than two pairs of silver arm-bands; leggings and\nmoccasins of the most elaborate embroidery in ribbons and\nporcupine-quills; everything that he could devise in the shape of\nornament hanging to his club of hair behind; a feather fan in one hand,\nand in the other a mirror, in which he contemplated himself every five\nminutes; these, with the variety and brilliancy of the colors upon his\nface, the suitable choice and application of which occupied no small\nportion of the hours allotted to his toilet, made up the equipment of\nyoung Four-Legs.",
        "This devotion to dress and appearance seemed not altogether out of\nplace in a youthful dandy; but we had likewise an old one of the same\nstamp. Pawnee Blanc, or the White Pawnee, surpassed his younger\ncompetitor, if possible, in attention to his personal attractions.",
        "Upon the present occasion he appeared in all his finery, and went\nthrough the customary salutations with an air of solemn dignity, then\nwalked, as did the others, into the parlor (for I had received them in\nthe hall), where they all seated themselves upon the floor. Fortunately,\nthe room was now bare of furniture, but “alas!” thought I, “for my\npretty carpet, if this is to be the way they pay their respects to me!\"\nI watched the falling of the ashes from their long pipes, and the other\ninconveniences of the use of tobacco, or kin-nee-kin-nick, with absolute\ndismay.",
        "The visit of the chiefs was succeeded by one from the interpreter and\nhis wife, with all the Canadian and half-breed women, whose husbands\nfound employment at the Agency or at the American Fur Company’s\nestablishment.",
        "By this time my piano had been taken from its case and set up in our\nquarters. To our great joy, we found it entirely uninjured. Thanks to\nthe skill of Nunns and Clark, not a note was out of tune.",
        "The women, to whom it was an entire novelty, were loud in their\nexclamations of wonder and delight.",
        "“Eh-h-h! regardez donc! Quelles inventions! Quelles merveilles!“[13]",
        "One, observing the play of my fingers reflected in the nameboard, called\nin great exultation to her companions. She had discovered, as she\nthought, the hidden machinery by which the sounds were produced, and was\nnot a little mortified when she was undeceived.",
