        "In the preceding chapter we have followed the fortunes of Charles Stuart,\nfrom his landing in Scotland to his defeat at Worcester and his escape to\nthe continent; we may now look back and direct our attention to some of the\nmore important events which occurred during the same period, in England and\nIreland.",
        "1. The reader is aware that the form of government established in England\nwas an oligarchy. A few individuals, under the cover of a nominal\nparliament, ruled the kingdom with the power of the sword. Could the sense\nof the nation have been collected, there cannot be a doubt that the old\nroyalists of the Cavalier, and the new royalists of the Presbyterian party,\nwould have formed a decided majority; but they were awed into silence and\nsubmission by the presence of a standing army of forty-five thousand men;\nand the maxim that “power gives right” was held out as a sufficient reason\nwhy they should swear fidelity to the commonwealth.[1] This numerous army,",

        "the real source of their security, proved, however, a cause of constant\nsolicitude to the leaders. The pay of the officers and men was always in\narrear; the debentures which they received could be seldom exchanged for\nmoney without a loss of fifty, sixty, or seventy per cent.; and the plea of\nnecessity was accepted as an excuse for the illegal claim of free quarters\nwhich they frequently exercised. To supply their wants, recourse was\ntherefore had to additional taxation, with occasional grants from the\nexcise, and large sales of forfeited property;[1] and, to appease\nthe discontent of the people, promises were repeatedly made, that a\nconsiderable portion of the armed force should be disbanded, and the\npractice of free quarter be abolished. But of these promises, the first\nproved a mere delusion; for, though some partial reductions were made, on\nthe whole the amount of the army continued to increase; the second was\nfulfilled; but in return, the burthen of taxation was augmented; for the\nmonthly assessment on the counties gradually swelled from sixty to ninety,\nto one hundred and twenty, and in conclusion, to one hundred and sixty\nthousand pounds.[2]",
        "Another subject of disquietude sprung out of those principles of liberty\nwhich, even after the suppression of the late mutiny, were secretly\ncherished and occasionally avowed, by the soldiery.

By the latter Lilburne\nwas revered as an apostle and a martyr; they read with avidity the\npublications which repeatedly issued from his cell; and they condemned as\npersecutors and tyrants the men who had immured him and his companions in\nthe Tower. Preparations had been made[a] to bring them to trial as the\nauthors of the late mutiny; but, on more mature deliberation, the project\nwas abandoned,[b] and an act was passed making it treason to assert that\nthe government was tyrannical, usurped, or unlawful. No enactments,\nhowever, could check the hostility of Lilburne; and a new pamphlet from his\npen,[c] in vindication of “The Legal Fundamental Liberties of the People,\"\nput to the test the resolution of his opponents.

        "The Levellers had boldly avowed their object; the royalists worked in the\ndark and by stealth; yet the council by its vigilance and promptitude\nproved a match for the open hostility of the one and the secret\nmachinations of the other. A doubt may, indeed, be raised of the policy of\nthe “engagement,” a promise of fidelity to the commonwealth without king or\nhouse of lords. As long as it was confined to those who held office under\nthe government, it remained a mere question of choice; but when it was\nexacted from all Englishmen above seventeen years of age, under the penalty\nof incapacity to maintain an action in any court of law, it became to\nnumbers a matter of necessity, and served rather to irritate than\nto produce security.[2] A more efficient measure was the permanent\nestablishment of a high court of justice to inquire into offences against\nthe state, to which was added the organization of a system of espionage by\nCaptain Bishop, under the direction of Scot, a member of the council.

Then followed an active\ncorrespondence both with Charles soon after his arrival in Scotland, and\nwith the earl of Newcastle, the Lord Hopton, and a council of exiles; first\nat Utrecht, and afterwards at the Hague. By the plan ultimately adopted, it\nwas proposed that Charles himself or Massey, leaving a sufficient force\nto occupy the English army in Scotland, should, with a strong corps of\nCavalry, cross[a] the borders between the kingdoms; that at the same time\nthe royalists in the several associations should rise in arms, and that\nthe exiles in Holland, with five thousand English and German adventurers,\nshould land in Kent, surprise Dover, and hasten to join their Presbyterian\nassociates, in the capital.[1] But, to arrange and insure the co-operation\nof all the parties concerned required the employment of numerous agents, of\nwhom, if several were actuated by principle, many were of doubtful faith\nand desperate fortunes. Some of these betrayed their trust; some undertook\nto serve both parties, and deceived each; and it is a curious fact that,\nwhile the letters of the agents for the royalists often passed through the\nhands of Bishop himself, his secret papers belonging to the council of\nstate were copied and forwarded to the king.[2] This consequence however\nfollowed,",

While the king was on his\nway to Scotland, a number of blank commissions had been seized in the\npossession of Dr. Lewen, a civilian, who suffered[a] the penalty of death.\nSoon afterwards Sir John Gell, Colonel Eusebius Andrews, and Captain\nBenson, were arraigned on the charge of conspiring the destruction of\nthe government established by law. They opposed three objections to the\njurisdiction of the court: it was contrary to Magna Charta, which gave\nto every freeman the right of being tried by his peers; contrary to the\npetition of right, by which courts-martial (and the present court was most\ncertainly a court-martial) had been forbidden; and contrary to the many\ndeclarations of parliament, that the laws, the rights of the people, and\nthe courts of justice, should be maintained. But the court repelled[b] the\nobjections; Andrews and Benson suffered death, and Gell, who had not\nbeen an accomplice, but only cognizant of the plot, was condemned[c] to\nperpetual imprisonment, with the forfeiture of his property.[1]",

Since\nthe loss of Munster by the defection of Inchiquin’s forces, they had\nentertained an incurable distrust of their English allies; and to appease\ntheir jealousy, he dismissed the few Englishmen who yet remained in the\nservice. Finding them rise in their demands, he called a general assembly\nat Loughrea, announced his intention, or pretended intention, of quitting\nthe kingdom; and then, at the general request, and after some demur,\nconsented to remain.

Without, however, waiting for his answer, they\nproceeded to frame[b] a declaration, in which they charged Ormond with\nnegligence, incapacity, and perfidy; protested that, though they were\ncompelled by the great duty of self-preservation to withdraw from the\ngovernment of the king’s lieutenant, they had no intention to derogate from\nthe royal authority; and pronounced that, in the existing circumstances,\nthe Irish people were no longer bound by the articles of the pacification,\nbut by the oath under which they had formerly associated for their\ncommon protection.

They\nmaintained that nothing but a general negotiation could put an end to those\nprivate treaties which daily thinned their numbers, and exposed the more\nresolute to inevitable ruin; that the conditions held out were better than\nthey had reason to expect now, infinitely better than they could expect\nhereafter. Let them put the sincerity of their enemies to the test. If\nthe treaty should succeed, the nation would be saved; if it did not, the\nfailure would unite all true Irishmen in the common cause, who, if they\nmust fall, would not fall unrevenged. There was much force in this\nreasoning; and it was strengthened by the testimony of officers from\nseveral quarters, who represented that, to negotiate with the parliament\nwas the only expedient for the preservation of the people. But Clanricard\ntreated the proposal with contempt. To entertain it was an insult to him,\nan act of treason against the king; and he was seconded by the eloquence\nand authority of Castlehaven, who affected to despise the power of the\nenemy, and attributed his success to their own divisions.

Some of the officers declared that the parliament must be\ndissolved “one way or other;” but the general checked their indiscretion\nand precipitancy; and the assembly broke up at midnight, with an\nunderstanding that the leading men on each side should resume the subject\nin the morning.[2]",
        "At an early hour the conference was recommenced,[b] and after a short time\ninterrupted, in consequence of the receipt of a notice by the general that\nit was the intention of the house to comply with the desires of the army.\nThis was a mistake: the opposite party, led by Vane, who had discovered the\nobject of Cromwell,",

        "had indeed resolved to pass a bill of dissolution, not, however, the bill\nproposed by the officers, but their own bill, containing all the obnoxious\nprovisions; and to pass it that very morning, that it might obtain the\nforce of law before their adversaries could have time to appeal to the\npower of the sword.[1] While Harrison “most sweetly and humbly” conjured\nthem to pause before they took so important a step, Ingoldsby hastened\nto inform the lord-general at Whitehall. His resolution was immediately\nformed, and a company of musketeers received orders to accompany him to the\nhouse.",
        "At this eventful moment, big with the most important consequences both to\nhimself and his country, whatever were the workings of Cromwell’s mind, he\nhad the art to conceal them from the eyes of the beholders. Leaving the\nmilitary in the lobby, he entered the house, and composedly seated himself\non one of the outer benches. His dress was a plain suit of black cloth,\nwith grey worsted stockings. For a while he seemed to listen with interest\nto the debate; but, when the speaker was going to put the question, he\nwhispered to Harrison, “This is the time: I must do it;” and rising, put\noff his hat to address the house. At first his language was decorous and\neven laudatory. Gradually he became more warm and animated: at last\nhe assumed all the vehemence of passion, and indulged in personal\nvituperation. He charged the members with self-seeking and profaneness;\nwith the frequent denial of justice, and numerous",
        "[Footnote 1: These particulars may be fairly collected from Whitelock, 554,\ncompared with the declaration of the officers, and Cromwell’s speech to\nhis parliament. The intention to dissolve themselves is also asserted by\nHazlerig.–Burton’s Diary, iii. 98.]",
        "acts of oppression; with idolizing the lawyers, the constant advocates of\ntyranny; with neglecting the men who had bled for them in the field, that\nthey might gain the Presbyterians who had apostatized from the cause;\nand with doing all this in order to perpetuate their own power, and to\nreplenish their own purses. But their time was come; the Lord had disowned\nthem; he had chosen more worthy instruments to perform his work. Here the\norator was interrupted by Sir Peter Wentworth, who declared that he\nnever before heard language so unparliamentary, language, too, the more\noffensive, because it was addressed to them by their own servant, whom they\nhad too fondly cherished, and whom, by their unprecedented bounty, they had\nmade what he was. At these words Cromwell put on his hat, and, springing\nfrom his place, exclaimed, “Come, come, sir, I will put an end to your\nprating.” For a few seconds, apparently in the most violent agitation, he\npaced forward and backward, and then, stamping on the floor, added, “You\nare no parliament. I say you are no parliament: bring them in, bring them\nin.” Instantly the door opened, and Colonel Worseley entered, followed by\nmore than twenty musketeers. “This,” cried Sir Henry Vane, “is not honest.\nIt is against morality and common honesty.” “Sir Henry Vane,” replied\nCromwell, “O Sir Henry Vane! The Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane! He\nmight have prevented this. But he is a juggler, and has not common honesty\nhimself.” From Vane he directed his discourse to Whitelock, on whom he\npoured a torrent of abuse; then, pointing to Challoner, “There,” he\ncried, “sits a drunkard;” next, to Marten and Wentworth, “There are two\nwhoremasters:” and afterwards, selecting different members in succession,\ndescribed them as dishonest and corrupt livers, a shame and a scandal to\nthe profession of the gospel. Suddenly, however, checking himself, he\nturned to the guard, and ordered them to clear the house. At these words\nColonel Harrison took the speaker by the hand, and led him from the chair;\nAlgernon Sidney was next compelled to quit his seat; and the other members,\neighty in number, on the approach of the military, rose and moved towards\nthe door. Cromwell now resumed his discourse. “It is you,” he exclaimed,\n“that have forced me to do this. I have sought the Lord both day and night,\nthat he would rather slay me, than put me on the doing of this work.\"\nAlderman Allen took advantage of these words to observe, that it was not\nyet too late to undo what had been done; but Cromwell instantly charged him\nwith peculation, and gave him into custody. When all were gone, fixing his\neye on the mace, “What,” said he, “shall we do with this fool’s bauble?\nHere, carry it away.” Then, taking the act of dissolution from the clerk,\nhe ordered the doors to be locked, and, accompanied by the military,\nreturned to Whitehall.",
        "That afternoon the members of the council assembled in their usual place of\nmeeting. Bradshaw had just taken the chair, when the lord-general entered,\nand told them, that if they were there as private individuals, they\nwere welcome; but, if as the council of state, they must know that the\nparliament was dissolved, and with it also the council. “Sir,” replied\nBradshaw, with the spirit of an ancient Roman, “we have heard what you did\nat the house this morning, and before many hours all England will know it.\nBut, sir, you are mistaken to think that the parliament is dissolved. No\npower under heaven can dissolve them but themselves. Therefore take you\nnotice of that.” After this protest they withdrew.[1]",
        "Thus, by the parricidal hands of its own children, perished the long\nparliament, which, under a variety of forms, had, for more than twelve\nyears, defended and invaded the liberties of the nation. It fell without a\nstruggle or a groan, unpitied and unregretted. The members slunk away to\ntheir homes, where they sought by submission to purchase the forbearance\nof their new master; and their partisans, if partisans they had, reserved\nthemselves in silence for a day of retribution, which came not before\nCromwell slept in his grave. The royalists congratulated each other on an\nevent which they deemed a preparatory step to the restoration of the king;\nthe army and navy, in numerous addresses, declared that they would live or\ndie, stand or fall, with the lord-general, and in every part of the country\nthe congregations of the saints magnified the arm of the Lord which had\nbroken the mighty, that in lieu of the sway of mortal men, “the fifth\nmonarchy, the reign of Christ, might be established upon earth.\"[2]",
        "It would, however, be unjust to the memory of those who exercised the\nsupreme power after the death of the king, not to acknowledge that there\nexisted among them men capable of wielding with energy the destinies of a\ngreat empire. They governed only four years; yet, under their auspices, the\nconquests of Ireland and Scotland were achieved, and a navy was",

Deliberative assemblies are always slow in their proceedings;\nyet the pleasure of parliament, as the supreme power, was to be taken\non every subject connected with the foreign relations, or the internal\nadministration of the country; and hence it happened that, among the\nimmense variety of questions which came before it, those commanded\nimmediate attention which were deemed of immediate necessity; while the\nothers, though often of the highest importance to the national welfare,\nwere first postponed, then neglected, and ultimately forgotten. To this\nhabit of procrastination was perhaps owing the extinction of its authority.\nIt disappointed the hopes of the country, and supplied Cromwell with the\nmost plausible argument in defence of his conduct.",
        "Of the parliamentary transactions up to this period, the principal have\nbeen noticed in the preceding pages. I shall add a few others which may\nbe thought worthy the attention of the reader. 1. It was complained that,\nsince the abolition of the spiritual tribunals, the sins of incest,\nadultery, and fornication had been multiplied, in consequence of the\nimpunity with which they might be committed; and, at the prayer of the\ngodly, they were made[a] criminal offences, cognizable by the criminal\ncourts, and punishable, the two first with death, the last with three\nmonths’ imprisonment.",

        "But it was predicted at the time, and experience verified the prediction,\nthat the severity of the punishment would defeat the purpose of the law. 2.\nScarcely a petition was presented, which did not, among other things, pray\nfor the reformation of the courts of justice; and the house, after several\nlong debates, acquiesced[a] in a measure, understood to be only the\nforerunner of several others,[b] that the law books should be written, and\nlaw proceedings be conducted in the English language.[1] 3. So enormous\nwere the charges of the commonwealth, arising from incessant war by sea or\nland, that questions of finance continually engaged the attention of the\nhouse. There were four principal sources of revenue; the customs, the\nexcise, the sale of fee-farm rents,[2] of the lands of the crown, and of\nthose belonging to the bishops, deans, and chapters, and the sequestration\nand forfeiture of the estates of papists and delinquents. The ordinances\nfor the latter had been passed as early as the year 1643, and in the course\nof the seven succeeding years, the harvest had been reaped and gathered.\nStill some gleanings might remain; and in 1650, an act was passed[c] for\nthe better ordering and managing such estates; the former compositions\nwere subjected to examination; defects and concealments were detected;\nand proportionate fines were in numerous cases exacted. In 1651, seventy\nindividuals, most of them of high rank, all of opulent fortunes, who\nhad imprudently displayed their attachment to the royal cause, were\ncondemned[d] to forfeit their property,",

The clergy of the established church were ejected\nfrom their livings, and the professors of the Catholic faith were condemned\nto forfeit two-thirds of their property, or to abjure their religion. Nor\nwas the proof of recusancy to depend, as formerly, on the slow process of\npresentation and conviction; bare suspicion was held a sufficient ground\nfor the sequestrator to seize his prey; and the complainant was told that\nhe had the remedy in his own hands, he might take the oath of abjuration.\nWhen the Independents succeeded to the exercise of the supreme power, both\nthe persecuted parties indulged a hope of more lenient treatment, and both\nwere disappointed.

The ejected clergymen were still excluded from the\npulpit, and the Catholics were still the victims of persecuting statutes.\nIn 1650, an act was passed[a] offering to the discoverers of priests and\nJesuits, or of their receivers and abettors, the same reward as had been\ngranted to the apprehenders of highwaymen. Immediately officers and\ninformers were employed in every direction; the houses of Catholics were\nbroken open and searched at all hours of the day and night; many clergymen\nwere apprehended, and several were tried, and received[b] judgment of\ndeath.
