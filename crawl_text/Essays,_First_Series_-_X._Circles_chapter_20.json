        "The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it\nforms is the second; and throughout nature this\nprimary figure is repeated without end. It is the\nhighest emblem in the cipher of the world. St.\nAugustine described the nature of God as a circle\nwhose centre was everywhere and its circumference\nnowhere.  We are all our lifetime reading the copious\nsense of this first of forms. One moral we have already\ndeduced, in considering the circular or compensatory\ncharacter of every human action. Another analogy we\nshall now trace, that every action admits of being\noutdone. Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth\nthat around every circle another can be drawn; that\nthere is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning;\nthat there is always another dawn risen on mid-noon,\nand under every deep a lower deep opens.",
        "This fact, as far as it symbolizes the moral fact of\nthe Unattainable, the flying Perfect, around which the\nhands of man can never meet, at once the inspirer and\nthe condemner of every success, may conveniently serve\nus to connect many illustrations of human power in\nevery department.",
        "There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is\nfluid and volatile. Permanence is but a word of\ndegrees.  Our globe seen by God is a transparent\nlaw, not a mass of facts. The law dissolves the\nfact and holds it fluid. Our culture is the\npredominance of an idea which draws after it this\ntrain of cities and institutions.  Let us rise into\nanother idea: they will disappear. The Greek\nsculpture is all melted away, as if it had been\nstatues of ice; here and there a solitary figure or\nfragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of\nsnow left in cold dells and mountain clefts in June\nand July. For the genius that created it creates now\nsomewhat else. The Greek letters last a little longer,\nbut are already passing under the same sentence and\ntumbling into the inevitable pit which the creation\nof new thought opens for all that is old. The new\ncontinents are built out of the ruins of an old planet;\nthe new races fed out of the decomposition of the\nforegoing. New arts destroy the old. See the investment\nof capital in aqueducts made useless by hydraulics;\nfortifications, by gunpowder; roads and canals, by\nrailways; sails, by steam; steam by electricity.",
        "You admire this tower of granite, weathering the\nhurts of so many ages. Yet a little waving hand\nbuilt this huge wall, and that which builds is\nbetter than that which is built. The hand that\nbuilt can topple it down much faster. Better than\nthe hand and nimbler was the invisible thought\nwhich wrought through it; and thus ever, behind\nthe coarse effect, is a fine cause, which, being\nnarrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer\ncause. Every thing looks permanent until its secret\nis known. A rich estate appears to women a firm and\nlasting fact; to a merchant, one easily created out\nof any materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good\ntillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold\nmine, or a river, to a citizen; but to a large farmer,\nnot much more fixed than the state of the crop. Nature\nlooks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a\ncause like all the rest; and when once I comprehend\nthat, will these fields stretch so immovably wide,\nthese leaves hang so individually considerable?\nPermanence is a word of degrees. Every thing is medial.\nMoons are no more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls.",
        "The key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying\nthough he look, he has a helm which he obeys, which is\nthe idea after which all his facts are classified. He\ncan only be reformed by showing him a new idea which\ncommands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving\ncircle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes\non all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and\nthat without end. The extent to which this generation\nof circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on\nthe force or truth of the individual soul. For it is\nthe inert effort of each thought, having formed itself\ninto a circular wave of circumstance,—as for instance\nan empire, rules of an art, a local usage, a religious\nrite,—to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify and\nhem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it\nbursts over that boundary on all sides and expands\nanother orbit on the great deep, which also runs up into\na high wave, with attempt again to stop and to bind. But\nthe heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and\nnarrowest pulses, it already tends outward with a vast\nforce and to immense and innumerable expansions.",
        "Every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series.\nEvery general law only a particular fact of some more\ngeneral law presently to disclose itself. There is no\noutside, no inclosing wall, no circumference to us. The\nman finishes his story,—how good! how final! how it\nputs a new face on all things! He fills the sky. Lo!\non the other side rises also a man and draws a circle\naround the circle we had just pronounced the outline of\nthe sphere. Then already is our first speaker not man,\nbut only a first speaker. His only redress is forthwith\nto draw a circle outside of his antagonist. And so men\ndo by themselves. The result of to-day, which haunts the\nmind and cannot be escaped, will presently be abridged\ninto a word, and the principle that seemed to explain\nnature will itself be included as one example of a bolder\ngeneralization. In the thought of to-morrow there is a\npower to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the\nliteratures of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven\nwhich no epic dream has yet depicted. Every man is not\nso much a workman in the world as he is a suggestion of\nthat he should be. Men walk as prophecies of the next age.",
        "Step by step we scale this mysterious ladder: the\nsteps are actions; the new prospect is power. Every\nseveral result is threatened and judged by that which\nfollows. Every one seems to be contradicted by the\nnew; it is only limited by the new. The new statement\nis always hated by the old, and, to those dwelling in\nthe old, comes like an abyss of scepticism. But the\neye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are\neffects of one cause; then its innocency and benefit\nappear, and presently, all its energy spent, it pales\nand dwindles before the revelation of the new hour.",
        "Fear not the new generalization. Does the fact look\ncrass and material, threatening to degrade thy theory\nof spirit? Resist it not; it goes to refine and raise\nthy theory of matter just as much.",
        "There are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to consciousness.\nEvery man supposes himself not to be fully understood; and\nif there is any truth in him, if he rests at last on the\ndivine soul, I see not how it can be otherwise. The last\nchamber, the last closet, he must feel was never opened;\nthere is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable. That is,\nevery man believes that he has a greater possibility.",
        "Our moods do not believe in each other. To-day I am\nfull of thoughts and can write what I please. I see\nno reason why I should not have the same thought,\nthe same power of expression, to-morrow. What I write,\nwhilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the\nworld; but yesterday I saw a dreary vacuity in this\ndirection in which now I see so much; and a month hence,\nI doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so\nmany continuous pages. Alas for this infirm faith, this\nwill not strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow! I am\nGod in nature; I am a weed by the wall.",
        "The continual effort to raise himself above himself,\nto work a pitch above his last height, betrays itself\nin a man’s relations. We thirst for approbation, yet\ncannot forgive the approver. The sweet of nature is\nlove; yet, if I have a friend I am tormented by my\nimperfections. The love of me accuses the other party.\nIf he were high enough to slight me, then could I love\nhim, and rise by my affection to new heights. A man’s\ngrowth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends.\nFor every friend whom he loses for truth, he gains a\nbetter. I thought as I walked in the woods and mused\non my friends, why should I play with them this game of\nidolatry? I know and see too well, when not voluntarily\nblind, the speedy limits of persons called high and\nworthy. Rich, noble and great they are by the liberality\nof our speech, but truth is sad. O blessed Spirit, whom\nI forsake for these, they are not thou! Every personal\nconsideration that we allow costs us heavenly state. We\nsell the thrones of angels for a short and turbulent\npleasure.",
        "How often must we learn this lesson? Men cease to\ninterest us when we find their limitations. The only\nsin is limitation. As soon as you once come up with a\nman’s limitations, it is all over with him. Has he\ntalents? has he enterprise? has he knowledge? It boots\nnot. Infinitely alluring and attractive was he to you\nyesterday, a great hope, a sea to swim in; now, you\nhave found his shores, found it a pond, and you care\nnot if you never see it again.",
        "Each new step we take in thought reconciles twenty\nseemingly discordant facts, as expressions of one\nlaw. Aristotle and Plato are reckoned the respective\nheads of two schools. A wise man will see that\nAristotle platonizes. By going one step farther back\nin thought, discordant opinions are reconciled by\nbeing seen to be two extremes of one principle, and\nwe can never go so far back as to preclude a still\nhigher vision.",
        "Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this\nplanet. Then all things are at risk. It is as when a\nconflagration has broken out in a great city, and no\nman knows what is safe, or where it will end. There\nis not a piece of science but its flank may be turned\nto-morrow; there is not any literary reputation, not\nthe so-called eternal names of fame, that may not be\nrevised and condemned. The very hopes of man, the\nthoughts of his heart, the religion of nations, the\nmanners and morals of mankind are all at the mercy of\na new generalization. Generalization is always a new\ninflux of the divinity into the mind. Hence the thrill\nthat attends it.",
        "Valor consists in the power of self-recovery, so\nthat a man cannot have his flank turned, cannot be\nout-generalled, but put him where you will, he stands.\nThis can only be by his preferring truth to his past\napprehension of truth, and his alert acceptance of it\nfrom whatever quarter; the intrepid conviction that\nhis laws, his relations to society, his Christianity,\nhis world, may at any time be superseded and decease.",
        "There are degrees in idealism. We learn first to play\nwith it academically, as the magnet was once a toy.\nThen we see in the heyday of youth and poetry that it\nmay be true, that it is true in gleams and fragments.\nThen its countenance waxes stern and grand, and we see\nthat it must be true. It now shows itself ethical and\npractical. We learn that God is; that he is in me; and\nthat all things are shadows of him.  The idealism of\nBerkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of\nJesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact\nthat all nature is the rapid efflux of goodness executing\nand organizing itself. Much more obviously is history and\nthe state of the world at any one time directly dependent\non the intellectual classification then existing in the\nminds of men. The things which are dear to men at this\nhour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged\non their mental horizon, and which cause the present order\nof things, as a tree bears its apples. A new degree of\nculture would instantly revolutionize the entire system\nof human pursuits.",
        "Conversation is a game of circles. In conversation\nwe pluck up the termini which bound the common of\nsilence on every side. The parties are not to be\njudged by the spirit they partake and even express\nunder this Pentecost. To-morrow they will have receded\nfrom this high-water mark. To-morrow you shall find\nthem stooping under the old pack-saddles. Yet let us\nenjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls.\nWhen each new speaker strikes a new light, emancipates\nus from the oppression of the last speaker, to oppress\nus with the greatness and exclusiveness of his own\nthought, then yields us to another redeemer, we seem\nto recover our rights, to become men. O, what truths\nprofound and executable only in ages and orbs, are\nsupposed in the announcement of every truth! In common\nhours, society sits cold and statuesque. We all stand\nwaiting, empty,—knowing, possibly, that we can be full,\nsurrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to\nus, but prose and trivial toys. Then cometh the god and\nconverts the statues into fiery men, and by a flash of\nhis eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things,\nand the meaning of the very furniture, of cup and saucer,\nof chair and clock and tester, is manifest. The facts\nwhich loomed so large in the fogs of yesterday,—property,\nclimate, breeding, personal beauty and the like, have\nstrangely changed their proportions. All that we reckoned\nsettled shakes and rattles; and literatures, cities,\nclimates, religions, leave their foundations and dance\nbefore our eyes. And yet here again see the swift\ncircumspection! Good as is discourse, silence is better,\nand shames it. The length of the discourse indicates the\ndistance of thought betwixt the speaker and the hearer.\nIf they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no\nwords would be necessary thereon. If at one in all parts,\nno words would be suffered.",
        "Literature is a point outside of our hodiernal circle\nthrough which a new one may be described. The use of\nliterature is to afford us a platform whence we may\ncommand a view of our present life, a purchase by\nwhich we may move it. We fill ourselves with ancient\nlearning, install ourselves the best we can in Greek,\nin Punic, in Roman houses, only that we may wiselier\nsee French, English and American houses and modes of\nliving. In like manner we see literature best from the\nmidst of wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or\nfrom a high religion. The field cannot be well seen\nfrom within the field. The astronomer must have his\ndiameter of the earth’s orbit as a base to find the\nparallax of any star.",
        "Therefore we value the poet. All the argument and all\nthe wisdom is not in the encyclopaedia, or the treatise\non metaphysics, or the Body of Divinity, but in the\nsonnet or the play. In my daily work I incline to repeat\nmy old steps, and do not believe in remedial force, in\nthe power of change and reform. But some Petrarch or\nAriosto, filled with the new wine of his imagination,\nwrites me an ode or a brisk romance, full of daring\nthought and action. He smites and arouses me with his\nshrill tones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and\nI open my eye on my own possibilities. He claps wings\nto the sides of all the solid old lumber of the world,\nand I am capable once more of choosing a straight path\nin theory and practice.",
        "We have the same need to command a view of the religion\nof the world. We can never see Christianity from the\ncatechism:—from the pastures, from a boat in the pond,\nfrom amidst the songs of wood-birds we possibly may.\nCleansed by the elemental light and wind, steeped in the\nsea of beautiful forms which the field offers us, we may\nchance to cast a right glance back upon biography.\nChristianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind; yet\nwas there never a young philosopher whose breeding had\nfallen into the Christian church by whom that brave text\nof Paul’s was not specially prized:—\"Then shall also the\nSon be subject unto Him who put all things under him, that\nGod may be all in all.” Let the claims and virtues of\npersons be never so great and welcome, the instinct of man\npresses eagerly onward to the impersonal and illimitable,\nand gladly arms itself against the dogmatism of bigots with\nthis generous word out of the book itself.",
        "The natural world may be conceived of as a system of\nconcentric circles, and we now and then detect in\nnature slight dislocations which apprise us that this\nsurface on which we now stand is not fixed, but sliding.\nThese manifold tenacious qualities, this chemistry and\nvegetation, these metals and animals, which seem to\nstand there for their own sake, are means and methods\nonly,—are words of God, and as fugitive as other words.\nHas the naturalist or chemist learned his craft, who\nhas explored the gravity of atoms and the elective\naffinities, who has not yet discerned the deeper law\nwhereof this is only a partial or approximate statement,\nnamely that like draws to like, and that the goods which\nbelong to you gravitate to you and need not be pursued\nwith pains and cost? Yet is that statement approximate\nalso, and not final. Omnipresence is a higher fact. Not\nthrough subtle subterranean channels need friend and fact\nbe drawn to their counterpart, but, rightly considered,\nthese things proceed from the eternal generation of the\nsoul. Cause and effect are two sides of one fact.",
        "The same law of eternal procession ranges all that\nwe call the virtues, and extinguishes each in the\nlight of a better. The great man will not be prudent\nin the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much\ndeduction from his grandeur. But it behooves each to\nsee, when he sacrifices prudence, to what god he\ndevotes it; if to ease and pleasure, he had better\nbe prudent still; if to a great trust, he can well\nspare his mule and panniers who has a winged chariot\ninstead. Geoffrey draws on his boots to go through\nthe woods, that his feet may be safer from the bite\nof snakes; Aaron never thinks of such a peril. In many\nyears neither is harmed by such an accident. Yet it\nseems to me that with every precaution you take against\nsuch an evil you put yourself into the power of the evil.\nI suppose that the highest prudence is the lowest prudence.\nIs this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge\nof our orbit? Think how many times we shall fall back into\npitiful calculations before we take up our rest in the\ngreat sentiment, or make the verge of to-day the new\ncentre. Besides, your bravest sentiment is familiar to\nthe humblest men. The poor and the low have their way of\nexpressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you.\n“Blessed be nothing” and “The worse things are, the better\nthey are” are proverbs which express the transcendentalism\nof common life.",
        "One man’s justice is another’s injustice; one man’s\nbeauty another’s ugliness; one man’s wisdom another’s\nfolly; as one beholds the same objects from a higher\npoint. One man thinks justice consists in paying debts,\nand has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is\nvery remiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait\ntediously. But that second man has his own way of\nlooking at things; asks himself Which debt must I pay\nfirst, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor?\nthe debt of money, or the debt of thought to mankind,\nof genius to nature? For you, O broker, there is no\nother principle but arithmetic. For me, commerce is of\ntrivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the\naspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach\none duty, like you, from all other duties, and concentrate\nmy forces mechanically on the payment of moneys. Let me\nlive onward; you shall find that, though slower, the\nprogress of my character will liquidate all these debts\nwithout injustice to higher claims. If a man should\ndedicate himself to the payment of notes, would not this\nbe injustice? Does he owe no debt but money? And are all\nclaims on him to be postponed to a landlord’s or a banker’s?",
        "There is no virtue which is final; all are initial.\nThe virtues of society are vices of the saint. The\nterror of reform is the discovery that we must cast\naway our virtues, or what we have always esteemed\nsuch, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser\nvices:—",
        "It is the highest power of divine moments that they\nabolish our contritions also. I accuse myself of sloth\nand unprofitableness day by day; but when these waves\nof God flow into me I no longer reckon lost time. I no\nlonger poorly compute my possible achievement by what\nremains to me of the month or the year; for these moments\nconfer a sort of omnipresence and omnipotence which asks\nnothing of duration, but sees that the energy of the mind\nis commensurate with the work to be done, without time.",
        "And thus, O circular philosopher, I hear some reader\nexclaim, you have arrived at a fine Pyrrhonism, at an\nequivalence and indifferency of all actions, and would\nfain teach us that if we are true, forsooth, our crimes\nmay be lively stones out of which we shall construct the\ntemple of the true God!",
        "I am not careful to justify myself. I own I am\ngladdened by seeing the predominance of the saccharine\nprinciple throughout vegetable nature, and not less by\nbeholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of\nthe principle of good into every chink and hole that\nselfishness has left open, yea into selfishness and sin\nitself; so that no evil is pure, nor hell itself without\nits extreme satisfactions. But lest I should mislead any\nwhen I have my own head and obey my whims, let me remind\nthe reader that I am only an experimenter.  Do not set\nthe least value on what I do, or the least discredit on\nwhat I do not, as if I pretended to settle any thing as\ntrue or false. I unsettle all things. No facts are to me\nsacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless\nseeker with no Past at my back.",
        "Yet this incessant movement and progression which all\nthings partake could never become sensible to us but\nby contrast to some principle of fixture or stability\nin the soul. Whilst the eternal generation of circles\nproceeds, the eternal generator abides. That central\nlife is somewhat superior to creation, superior to\nknowledge and thought, and contains all its circles.\nFor ever it labors to create a life and thought as\nLarge and excellent as itself, but in vain, for that\nwhich is made instructs how to make a better.",
        "Thus there is no sleep, no pause, no preservation,\nbut all things renew, germinate and spring. Why\nshould we import rags and relics into the new hour?\nNature abhors the old, and old age seems the only\ndisease; all others run into this one. We call it by\nmany names,—fever, intemperance, insanity, stupidity\nand crime; they are all forms of old age; they are\nrest, conservatism, appropriation, inertia; not newness,\nnot the way onward. We grizzle every day. I see no need\nof it. Whilst we converse with what is above us, we do\nnot grow old, but grow young. Infancy, youth, receptive,\naspiring, with religious eye looking upward, counts\nitself nothing and abandons itself to the instruction\nflowing from all sides. But the man and woman of seventy\nassume to know all, they have outlived their hope, they\nrenounce aspiration, accept the actual for the necessary\nand talk down to the young. Let them, then, become organs\nof the Holy Ghost; let them be lovers; let them behold\ntruth; and their eyes are uplifted, their wrinkles smoothed,\nthey are perfumed again with hope and power. This old age\nought not to creep on a human mind. In nature every moment\nis new; the past is always swallowed and forgotten; the\ncoming only is sacred.  Nothing is secure but life,\ntransition, the energizing spirit. No love can be bound\nby oath or covenant to secure it against a higher love.\nNo truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in\nthe light of new thoughts. People wish to be settled; only\nas far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.",
        "Life is a series of surprises. We do not guess to-day\nthe mood, the pleasure, the power of to-morrow, when we\nare building up our being. Of lower states, of acts of\nroutine and sense, we can tell somewhat; but the\nmasterpieces of God, the total growths and universal\nmovements of the soul, he hideth; they are incalculable.\nI can know that truth is divine and helpful; but how it\nshall help me I can have no guess, for so to be is the\nsole inlet of so to know. The new position of the\nadvancing man has all the powers of the old, yet has\nthem all new. It carries in its bosom all the energies\nof the past, yet is itself an exhalation of the morning.\nI cast away in this new moment all my once hoarded\nknowledge, as vacant and vain. Now, for the first time\nseem I to know any thing rightly. The simplest words,—we\ndo not know what they mean except when we love and aspire.",
        "The difference between talents and character is\nadroitness to keep the old and trodden round, and\npower and courage to make a new road to new and\nbetter goals. Character makes an overpowering present;\na cheerful, determined hour, which fortifies all the\ncompany by making them see that much is possible and\nexcellent that was not thought of. Character dulls\nthe impression of particular events. When we see the\nconqueror we do not think much of any one battle or\nsuccess. We see that we had exaggerated the difficulty.\nIt was easy to him. The great man is not convulsible or\ntormentable; events pass over him without much impression.\nPeople say sometimes, ’See what I have overcome; see how\ncheerful I am; see how completely I have triumphed over\nthese black events.’ Not if they still remind me of the\nblack event. True conquest is the causing the calamity\nto fade and disappear as an early cloud of insignificant\nresult in a history so large and advancing.",
        "The one thing which we seek with insatiable desire is to\nforget ourselves, to be surprised out of our propriety,\nto lose our sempiternal memory and to do something without\nknowing how or why; in short to draw a new circle. Nothing\ngreat was ever achieved without enthusiasm. The way of life\nis wonderful; it is by abandonment. The great moments of\nhistory are the facilities of performance through the\nstrength of ideas, as the works of genius and religion.\n“A man” said Oliver Cromwell “never rises so high as when\nhe knows not whither he is going.” Dreams and drunkenness,\nthe use of opium and alcohol are the semblance and counterfeit\nof this oracular genius, and hence their dangerous attraction\nfor men. For the like reason they ask the aid of wild passions,\nas in gaming and war, to ape in some manner these flames and\ngenerosities of the heart.",
