        "The name of one of the oldest deities of which we have any record\nis Set (Phoenician) or Seth (Hebrew).  Traces of this God are\nfound in all oriental countries; and in the most primitive\nreligions, whose traditions are still extant, he (or she) appears\nas the supreme God.  After the subjection of Egypt by the\nstranger kings and the consequent introduction into the country\nof Sabianism, the dual creative force residing in the sun is\nrepresented by Seth.  We are told that Seth signifies “appointed\nor put in the place of the murdered Abel.”",
        "That there is some deep mystery connected with this subject none\nwho has studied it carefully can help observing.",
        "According to the story of creation as set forth in the Jehovistic\naccount, on Saturday night, after God had finished his work, and\nimmediately after he had commanded Adam to “be fruitful,” he\npresents him with a staff, which we observe is handed down to\nEnoch and all the patriarchs.  Here the mystery deepens, for it\nis declared that this staff was presented so Seth, and that it\nwas a branch of the Tree of Life.",
        "That beneath this allegory is veiled a contest, or perhaps a\ncompromise, between the worshippers of two distinct sects, seems\naltogether probable.  That the handing down of this branch of the\nTree of Life, first to Adam, or man, by Aleim, and its subsequent\ntransference to Seth, the God of Nature, the Destroyer or\nRegenerator, seems to indicate a victory for the adherents of a\npurer religion.  The translator of Kallimachus says: “It is well\nknown to the learned reader that the descendants of Cain are\ndistinguished in Scripture by the name of the sons of man or\nAdam; those of Seth by the name of the sons of God.”  Gen.  vi.,\n2.[85] It is stated in Julius Africanus that all the righteous\nmen and patriarchs down to the Saviour himself have sprung from\nSeth and have been denominated as the sons of God in\ncontradistinction to the sons of man.",
        "[85] Forlong, Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 527.",
        "Doubtless at the time indicated by the transference of the\ncreative agency from Aleim to Adam, the worship of an abstract\nprinciple, or of a Trinity composed of the powers of Nature, was\nlosing its hold on the minds of the people, and the creative\npower, or the reproductive energy in human beings, was rapidly\ntaking the place of the older Deity.  These higher principles\nforgotten, Adam, or man, had become the Creator.",
        "It is not improbable that the terms Adam, Cain, Abel, and Seth\nhave an esoteric meaning which for ages was known only to the\npriests.  From various facts which in later times are being\nbrought forward regarding the ancient myths of Genesis, it is\nbelieved that these names originally stood for races of men, and\nthat subsequently certain religious doctrines came to be attached\nto them.  The offering of fruit by Cain, the elder brother, who\nwas a tiller of the ground, and that of flesh by Abel, who was a\nkeeper of sheep, indicates a quarrel which ended in the death of\nthe latter.  After the death of Abel, or after one of these\nprinciples or sects was subdued, the older religion was revived,\nand Seth, as the Aleim, or as the creative power within the sun,\nwas “appointed” or again worshipped.",
        "It would seem that Seth was appointed to represent the third\nperson in the ancient Trinity–the Destroyer or Regenerator which\nhad previously come to embody all the powers of the Creator and\nPreserver.  The fact has been observed that the very ancient\nphilosophers believed matter to be eternal, hence, seeming death,\nor destruction, was necessary to renewed life or regeneration. \nIn other words, creation was but continuous change in the form of\nmatter.",
        "Of the doctrines of the Sethians extant at the beginning of\nChristianity, Hippolytus says that their system “is made up of\ntenets from natural philosophers.  These tenets embrace a belief\nin the Eternal Logos–Darkness, Mist, and Tempest.”  These\nelements subsequently became identified with the Evil Principle,\nor the Devil.  The cold of winter, the darkness of night, and\nwater, were finally set forth as the Trinity.  Regarding cold,\ndarkness, and water, or darkness, mist, and tempest, Hippolytus\nobserves:",
        "“These the Sethian says are the three principles of our system;\nor when he states that three were born in paradise– Adam, Eve,\nthe serpent; or when he speaks of three persons, namely, Cain,\nAbel, Seth, and again of three others, Shem, Ham, Japheth; or\nwhen he mentions three patriarchs–Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; or when\nhe speaks of three days before the sun, etc.”",
        "The same writer says that their entire system is derived from the\nancients; that, antecedent to the Eleusinian mysteries, were\nenacted by them the ceremonies connected with the worship of the\nGreat Mother.[86]",
        "[86] Hippolytus, Refutation of all Heresies, book v., ch. 15.",
        "We have observed that through some process not thoroughly\nunderstood at the present time, the adherents of the older faith\nhad succeeded in reinstating their Deity.  The powers of Nature\nhad come to be represented by Typhon Seth.  It was the God of\nDeath and of Life, of Destruction and Regeneration.  The simoom\nof the desert and the cold of winter were Seth, as were also the\ngenial powers of Spring.  We are informed by various writers that\nTyphon Seth was feminine.  She was the early God of the Jews.  In\nother words, the Jews were formerly worshippers of a female\nDeity.  Jehovah, Iav, was originally female.",
        "Although the secret meaning of all the allegories contained in\nthe Old Testament is not fully understood, still the belief that\nCain, Abel, and Seth represented the self-triplicated Deity at a\ntime when the idea of man as a creator had been accepted, or when\nhis power to reproduce was becoming the highest idea of a\ncreative force, is consistent with what is known of the Cabala of\nthe Jews, or of the esoteric meaning of the Jewish scriptures\nformerly known only to the priests.  In other words, the ancient\ndoctrines, the true meaning of which was no longer understood by\nthem, were patched together as a basis for the later developments\nin Jewish religious experience.",
        "We have seen that six hundred years after Adam appears Noah,\nanother self-triplicated Saviour or preserver of man, with his\nark or seed vessel, beneath which is veiled the female element. \nAfterward Abraham becomes the Great Father or Saviour, and later\nMoses.  That, in the time of the latter, the more ancient worship\nof a creative force in Nature represented by the Aleim, had, by\nthe masses of the people, been wholly lost, is evident from the\nOld Testament writings.  The worship of the Father, the male\npower, in opposition to that of the Mother, or the female power,\nconstituted the religion of Moses.  In the religion of the Jews,\nJehovah came to be regarded as wholly male and as spirit, while\nEdam (translated “downward tending”), the female principle, was\nmatter, or woman, which finally became identified with the Devil.",
        "The philosophical doctrine that spirit is evolved through matter,\nor that matter must be raised to a certain dynamical power before\nspirit can manifest itself through it, was no longer understood;\nonly the husks of this doctrine –the myths and symbols of\nNature-worship–remained; these were taken literally, and thus\nman’s religion was made to conform to his lowered estate.",
        "When man had so far gained the ascendancy over woman as to assert\nthat he is the sole Creator of their joint offspring, he was no\nlonger of the earth earthy, but at once became the child of\nheaven.  He was, however, bound to earth through his association\nwith matter, or with woman, from whom he was unable to free\nhimself.  The “sons of God” were united “to the daughters of\nman.”  Jahvah, the “God of hosts,” who was revengeful, weak,\njealous, and cruel, was worshipped in the place of Aleim the\ngreat dual force throughout Nature.  The ethereal, spiritual male\nessence resided somewhere in the heavens and created from afar,\nwhile the earth (female) furnished only the body or material\nsubstance.",
        "In the history of the god Seth is to be found a clue to the way\nin which the sublime and philosophical doctrines of the ancients,\nafter their true meaning was forgotten, were finally changed so\nas to conform to the enforced humiliation and degradation of\nwomen.",
        "Seth or Typhon was for ages worshipped throughout Egypt, and as\nshe comprehended the powers of Nature, or the creative energy\nresiding in the sun and earth, little is heard of any other god. \nStrange it is, however, that Seth is worshipped more in her\ncapacity as Destroyer than as Regenerator.  So soon as we\nunderstand the origin and character of the Devil, and so soon as\nwe divest ourselves of the false ideas which under a state of\nignorance and gross sensuality came to prevail relative to the\n“powers of darkness,” we shall perceive that his (or her) Satanic\nmajesty was once a very respectable personage and a powerful\nDivinity–a Divinity which was worshipped by a people whose\nsuperior intelligence can scarcely be questioned.  Regarding this\nsubject Higgins remarks:",
        "“Persons who have not given much consideration to these subjects\nwill be apt to wonder that any people should be found to offer\nadoration to the evil principle; but they do not consider that,\nin all these recondite systems, the evil principle, or the\nDestroyer, or Lord of Death, was at the same time the\nRegenerator.  He could not destroy but to reproduce, and it was\nprobably not till this principle began to be forgotten, that the\nevil being, per se, arose; for in some nations this effect seems\nto have taken place.  Thus Baal-Zebub is, in Iberno Celtic, Baal\nLord, and Zab Death, Lord of Death; but he is also called Aleim,\nthe same as the God of the Israelites; and this is right, because\nhe was one of the Trimurti or Trinity.",
        "“If I be correct respecting the word Aleim being feminine, we\nhere see the Lord of Death of the feminine gender; but the\nGoddess Ashtaroth or Astarte, the Eoster of the Germans, was also\ncalled Aleim.  Here again Aleim is feminine, which shows that I\nam right in making Aleim the plural feminine.  Thus we have\ndistinctly found Aleim the Creator (Gen. i., 1), Aleim the\nPreserver, and Aleim the Destroyer, and this not by inference,\nbut literally expressed.\"[87]",
        "[87] Anacalypsis, ch. ii., p. 66.",
        "At one period of their history the Hebrews worshipped Ashtaroth\nand Baal, they together representing the great Aleim, the\nindivisible God, but after the Israelites had chosen the worship\nof the male principle as an independent deity, or as the only\nimportant agency in the creative processes, as Baal might not be\nrepresented aside from his counterpart Ashtaroth, he was no\nlonger adored but came to stand for something “approaching the\nDevil.”  Forlong has observed the fact that, although in Hebrew\nBaal is masculine, in the Greek translations he is feminine both\nin the Old and New Testaments.[88]",
        "[88] Forlong, Rivers of Life, p. 223.",
        "Jehovah was originally female, so, also, was Netpe the Holy\nSpirit of the Egyptian Tree of Life.  We are given to understand\nthat Netpe was the same as Rhea, the partner of Sev or Saturn,\nand that her hieroglyphic name was “Abyss of Heaven.”  Osiris was\nthe son of this goddess who was really a Mai or Mary, the\nCelestial Mother, he being the only God of the Egyptians who was\nborn upon this earth and lived among men.  Of this Forlong\nremarks: “His birthplace was Mount Sinai; called by the Egyptians\nNysa, hence his Greek name Dionysos.”",
        "As the Palm was the first offering of Mother Earth to her\nchildren, so Osiris was the first offspring of the Egyptian\nCelestial Virgin to mankind.  He was the new sun which through\nthe winter months had been “buried,” but which in process of time\narose to gladden all the earth.  He was also the new Sun of\nRighteousness which was to renew the world, or redeem mankind\nfrom sin.",
        "The female principle for the time being cast out of the Deity,\nOsiris, the male element, now outwardly assumes the position of\nsupreme God.  It was, however, reserved for a later and more\nsensuous age to permanently adopt an absurdity so opposed to all\nestablished ideas relative to a creative force in Nature and in\nman.  Seth, the Destroyer, had been deposed, but, so deeply\nrooted in the human mind had become the idea of a female Creator,\nthat Isis, the Queen of Heaven, a somewhat lower conception of\nMuth, or of universal womanhood, soon assumed the place of Seth\nbeside Osiris.  Later in the history of Egypt, when the gods have\nbecome greatly multiplied, and the original significance of the\ndeity obscured, Horus, the child and the third member in the\nlater Egyptian triad, not unfrequently appears in her place as\none of the eight great gods.",
        "The fact is observed that the history of Osiris is not alone the\n“history of the circle of the year, or of the sun dying away and\nresuscitating itself again, but that it is also the history of\nthe cycle of 600.”  It has been said that of the component\nelements of his hieroglyphical name, Isis is the first, and that\nthe name Osiris really signifies the “Eye of Isis.”",
        "According to Plutarch, Isis and Muth are identical, but from the\nevidence at hand it is plain that Muth comprehends divine\nwomanhood, or the female principle as it was regarded at an\nearlier stage of human growth.  Muth is not only the parent of\nthe sun, or the force which produces the sun, but she is also\nWisdom, the first emanation from the Deity, at the same time that\nshe comprehends all the possibilities of Nature.  Isis seems to\nrepresent the Deity at a time when the higher truths known to a\nmore ancient people were beginning to lose their hold upon the\nrace.",
        "Renouf informs us that the word Maat, or Muth, means Law, “not in\nthat forensic sense of command issued either by a human sovereign\nauthority, or by a divine legislator, like the laws of the\nHebrews, but in the sense of that unerring order which governs\nthe universe, whether in its physical or its moral aspect.\"[89]\nThe same writer observes further that Maat “is called mistress of\nHeaven, ruler of earth, and president of the nether world,” and\nin a further description of the conception embodied in this\nDeity, refers to the fact that while she is the mother of the sun\nshe is also the first emanation from God.",
        "[89] The Religion of Ancient Egypt, p. 126.",
        "Although Typhon Seth was long worshipped as the sole Deity in\nEgypt, in later ages the god-idea came to be represented by Seth\nand Osiris.  Toward the close of Typhon Seth’s reign, Horus, the\nchild, the young sun, was represented “as rising from his\nhiding-place, attracting beneficent vapors to return them back as\ndews, which the Egyptians called the tears of Isis.”",
        "Seth and Osiris represent a division of the Deity.  Osiris, as\nthe sun, represents heat; as man, or as god, he stands for\ndesire.  Seth or Typhon stands for the cold of winter, the simoom\nof the desert, or the “wind that blasts.”  Seth, Osiris, and\nHorus constitute a Trinity of which Muth is the Great Mother. \nFinally, with the gradual ascendancy of male influence and power,\nit is observed that Seth appears as the brother of Osiris.",
        "It is the opinion of Bunsen that the fundamental idea of Osiris\nand Set was “not merely the glorification of the sun, but was\nalso the worship of the primitive creative power.\"[90] But, as in\nEgypt the creative agency was regarded as both female and male,\nthe former being in the ascendancy, this fact of itself would\nseem to determine the sex and position of Seth.",
        "[90] History of Egypt, vol. iv., p. 319.",
        "In the ideas concerning Seth and Osiris may be observed something\nof the manner in which the fructifying agencies of the sun and\nthe reproductive power in human beings were blended and together\nworshipped as the Deity; while through the history of these gods\nare to be traced some of the processes by which the idea of the\nCreator was changed from female to male.",
        "In all countries, at a certain stage in the history of religion,\nthe transference of female deified power to mortal man may be\nobserved.  In the attempt to change Seth or Typhon into a male\nGod may be noted perhaps the first effort in Egypt to dethrone,\nor lessen the female power in the god-idea.",
        "The fact seems plain that the Great Typhon Seth, or Set, who\nconferred on the sovereigns of the eighteenth and nineteenth\ndynasties of Egypt “the symbols of life and power,” was none\nother than the primitive Regenerator or Destroyer, who was for\nages worshipped as the God of Nature the Aleim, or the\nlife-giving energy throughout the universe.",
        "We have observed that when the profound principles underlying the\nmost ancient doctrines had been lost or forgotten, and when\nthrough the decay of philosophy, and through the stimulation of\nthe sensual in human nature, mankind had lost the power to reason\nabstractly, Destruction, which was symbolized by darkness or the\nabsence of the sun’s rays, finally became the evil principle, or\nthe Devil.  Darkness and cold, which had formerly been worshipped\nas the powers which brought forth the sun, or as mother of the\nsun, in process of time became the agency which is ever warring\nwith good and which is constantly destroying that which the\nlatter brings forth.",
        "We are informed by Forlong that “some derive our term Devil from\nNiphl or Nevil, the wind that blasts or obstructs the growth of\ncorn; and it used sometimes to be written th’ evil, which is\nD’evil or Devil.”",
        "It was “this Dualistic heresy which separated the Zend or Persian\nbranch of the Aryans from their Vedic brethren, and compelled\nthem to emigrate to the westward.\"[91]",
        "[91] See Rawlinson, Notes on the Early History of Babylon.",
        "The ancient philosophical truth that matter is eternal, and that\nthe destruction of vegetable life through the agency of cold was\none of the necessary processes of re-generation, or the renewal\nof life, had evidently been lost sight of at the time when Seth\nwas dethroned in Egypt.  Wilkinson informs us that “both Seth and\nOsiris were adored until a change took place respecting Seth,\nbrought about apparently by foreign influence.”  Sethi or Sethos,\na ruler whose reign represents the Augustan age of Egyptian\nsplendor, received his name from this Deity.  It is said that\nduring the twentieth dynasty Seth is suddenly portrayed as the\nprinciple of evil “with which is associated sin.”  Consequently\nall the effigies of this great Goddess were destroyed and all her\nnames and inscriptions “which could be reached” were effaced.",
        "Bunsen tells us that Schelling, who has made a study of Egyptian\nmythology, although totally ignorant of the later historical\nfacts which by means of hieroglyphical monuments have been\nobtained, had arrived at the conclusion that Seth had occupied an\nimportant position in the Deity down to the fourteenth century\nB.C.  “Schelling had on mere speculative grounds been brought to\nlay down as a postulate that Typhon, at some early period, had\nbeen considered by the Egyptians as a beneficent and powerful\nGod.”",
        "Wilkinson says that the character given to Seth, who was called\nBaal-Seth and the God of the Gentiles, “is explained by his being\nthe cause of evil.”  We are assured that formerly “Sin the great\nserpent, or Apophis the giant, was distinct from Seth who was a\ndeity and a part of the divine system.  But after the recondite\nprinciples underlying sun-worship were lost or forgotten; when\ncold and darkness, or the sinking away of the sun’s rays, which\nare necessary to the reappearance of light and warmth, came to be\nregarded as the destructive element, or the evil principle, woman\nbecame identified with this principle.  She was the producer of\nevil, and came to be represented in connection with a serpent as\nthe cause of all earthly or material things.  She is Destruction,\nbut not Regeneration.  She is in fact matter.  The cold of winter\nand the darkness of night, which are necessary to the return of\nthe sun’s warmth and which were formerly set forth as a\nbeneficent mother who brings forth the sun, became only the evil\nprinciple–that which obscures the light.  In fact Darkness or\nabsence of the sun’s heat has become the Devil.  It is the “cause\nof evil in the world.”",
        "With woman blinded by superstition, with every instinct of the\nfemale nature outraged, and with her position as the central\nfigure in the Deity and in the family usurped, her temples were\nsoon profaned, her images defiled, and the titles representing\nher former greatness transferred to males.",
        "There is no doubt but this doctrine was the legitimate outcome of\nthe decay of female influence.  Through the further stimulation\nof the lower nature of man its absurdity gradually increased,\nuntil under the system calling itself Christian it finally\nreached its height.  This subject will be referred to later in\nthese pages.",
        "When we remember that the original representation of the Deity\namong the nations of the earth consisted of a female figure\nembracing a child, and when we observe that subsequently in the\ndevelopment of the god-idea woman appears associated with a\nserpent as the cause of evil in the world, the history of the God\nSeth, who, as we have seen, represented the processes of Nature,\nnamely Destruction and Regeneration, seems quite significant as\nindicating some of the actual processes involved in this change.",
        "There can be little doubt that the facts relating to this Deity\nindicate the source whence has sprung the great theological dogma\nunderlying Christianity, that woman is the cause of evil in the\nworld.",
