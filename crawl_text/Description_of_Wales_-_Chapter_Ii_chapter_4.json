They were\nVenedotia, now called North Wales; Demetia, or South Wales, which\nin British is called Deheubarth, that is, the southern part; and\nPowys, the middle or eastern district.  Roderic the Great, or\nRhodri Mawr, who was king over all Wales, was the cause of this\ndivision.  He had three sons, Mervin, Anarawt, and Cadell, amongst\nwhom he partitioned the whole principality.  North Wales fell to\nthe lot of Mervin; Powys to Anarawt; and Cadell received the\nportion of South Wales, together with the general good wishes of\nhis brothers and the people; for although this district greatly\nexceeded the others in quantity, it was the least desirable from\nthe number of noble chiefs, or Uchelwyr, (6) men of a superior\nrank, who inhabited it, and were often rebellious to their lords,\nand impatient of control.  But Cadell, on the death of his\nbrothers, obtained the entire dominion of Wales, (7) as did his\nsuccessors till the time of Tewdwr, whose descendants, Rhys, son of\nTewdwr, Gruflydd, son of Rhys, and Rhys, son of Gruffydd, the\nruling prince in our time, enjoyed only (like the father) the\nsovereignty over South Wales.",
