        "When I returned to the common the sun was setting.\nScattered groups were hurrying from the direction of Woking,\nand one or two persons were returning.  The crowd about\nthe pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon\nyellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people, perhaps.\nThere were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared\nto be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed\nthrough my mind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:",
        "“Keep back!  Keep back!”",
        "A boy came running towards me.",
        "“It’s a-movin’,” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and\na-screwin’ out.  I don’t like it.  I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I am.”",
        "I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think,\ntwo or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one an-\nother, the one or two ladies there being by no means the\nleast active.",
        "“He’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one.",
        "“Keep back!” said several.",
        "The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.\nEvery one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar hum-\nming sound from the pit.",
        "“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back.  We\ndon’t know what’s in the confounded thing, you know!”",
        "I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe\nhe was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out\nof the hole again.  The crowd had pushed him in.",
        "The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.\nNearly two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blun-\ndered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto\nthe top of the screw.  I turned, and as I did so the screw must\nhave come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel\nwith a ringing concussion.  I stuck my elbow into the person\nbehind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again.\nFor a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black.\nI had the sunset in my eyes.",
        "I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly\nsomething a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essen-\ntials a man.  I know I did.  But, looking, I presently saw some-\nthing stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements,\none above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes.\nThen something resembling a little grey snake, about the\nthickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing\nmiddle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then\nanother.",
        "A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek\nfrom a woman behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed\nupon the cylinder still, from which other tentacles were now\nprojecting, and began pushing my way back from the edge\nof the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the\nfaces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate exclama-\ntions on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards.\nI saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I\nfound myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of\nthe pit running off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the\ncylinder, and ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petri-\nfied and staring.",
        "A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear,\nwas rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As\nit bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet\nleather.",
        "Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me stead-\nfastly.  The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was\nrounded, and had, one might say, a face.  There was a mouth\nunder the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and\npanted, and dropped saliva.  The whole creature heaved and\npulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacular appendage gripped\nthe edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.",
        "Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely\nimagine the strange horror of its appearance.  The peculiar\nV-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of\nbrow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike\nlower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon\ngroups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in\na strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness\nof movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the\nearth--above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense\neyes--were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and\nmonstrous.  There was something fungoid in the oily brown\nskin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedi-\nous movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this first en-\ncounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and\ndread.",
        "Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the\nbrim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like\nthe fall of a great mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar\nthick cry, and forthwith another of these creatures appeared\ndarkly in the deep shadow of the aperture.",
        "I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of\ntrees, perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly\nand stumbling, for I could not avert my face from these\nthings.",
        "There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I\nstopped, panting, and waited further developments.  The\ncommon round the sand pits was dotted with people, stand-\ning like myself in a half-fascinated terror, staring at these\ncreatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit\nin which they lay.  And then, with a renewed horror, I saw a\nround, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the\npit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but\nshowing as a little black object against the hot western sun.\nNow he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed\nto slip back until only his head was visible.  Suddenly he van-\nished, and I could have fancied a faint shriek had reached\nme.  I had a momentary impulse to go back and help him\nthat my fears overruled.",
        "Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep\npit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had\nmade.  Anyone coming along the road from Chobham or Wo-\nking would have been amazed at the sight--a dwindling mul-\ntitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a\ngreat irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind gates\nand hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,\nexcited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of\nsand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black\nagainst the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of\ndeserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags\nor pawing the ground.",
