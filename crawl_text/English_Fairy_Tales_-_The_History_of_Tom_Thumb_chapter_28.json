        "In the days of the great Prince Arthur, there lived a mighty magician,\ncalled Merlin, the most learned and skilful enchanter the world has\never seen.",
        "This famous magician, who could take any form he pleased, was\ntravelling about as a poor beggar, and being very tired, he stopped at\nthe cottage of a ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some food.",
        "The countryman bade him welcome, and his wife, who was a very good-\nhearted woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl, and some\ncoarse brown bread on a platter.",
        "Merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the ploughman and his\nwife; but he could not help noticing that though everything was neat\nand comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both to be very unhappy.\nHe therefore asked them why they were so melancholy, and learned that\nthey were miserable because they had no children.",
        "The poor woman said, with tears in her eyes: “I should be the happiest\ncreature in the world if I had a son; although he was no bigger than\nmy husband’s thumb, I would be satisfied.”",
        "Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a\nman’s thumb, that he determined to grant the poor woman’s wish.\nAccordingly, in a short time after, the ploughman’s wife had a son,\nwho, wonderful to relate! was not a bit bigger than his father’s\nthumb.",
        "The queen of the fairies, wishing to see the little fellow, came in at\nthe window while the mother was sitting up in the bed admiring him.\nThe queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent\nfor some of the fairies, who dressed her little godson according to\nher orders:",
        "  “An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;\n  His shirt of web by spiders spun;\n  With jacket wove of thistle’s down;\n  His trowsers were of feathers done.\n  His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie\n  With eyelash from his mother’s eye\n  His shoes were made of mouse’s skin,\n  Tann’d with the downy hair within.”",
        "Tom never grew any larger than his father’s thumb, which was only of\nordinary size; but as he got older he became very cunning and full of\ntricks. When he was old enough to play with the boys, and had lost all\nhis own cherry-stones, he used to creep into the bags of his\nplayfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out without their noticing\nhim, would again join in the game.",
        "One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry-stones,\nwhere he had been stealing as usual, the boy to whom it belonged\nchanced to see him. “Ah, ah! my little Tommy,” said the boy, “so I\nhave caught you stealing my cherry-stones at last, and you shall be\nrewarded for your thievish tricks.” On saying this, he drew the string\ntight round his neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor\nlittle Tom’s legs, thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out\nwith pain, and begged to be let out, promising never to steal again.",
        "A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and\nTom, being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge\nof the bowl; but his foot slipped, and he plumped over head and ears\ninto the batter, without his mother noticing him, who stirred him into\nthe pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.",
        "The batter filled Tom’s mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, on\nfeeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot,\nthat his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, pulling\nit out of the pot, she threw it outside the door. A poor tinker, who\nwas passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his\nbudget, he then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of\nthe batter, he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker\nthat he flung down the pudding and ran away. The pudding being broke\nto pieces by the fall, Tom crept out covered all over with the batter,\nand walked home. His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in\nsuch a woeful state, put him into a teacup, and soon washed off the\nbatter; after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.",
        "Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom’s mother went to milk her\ncow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was\nvery high, for fear of being blown away, she tied him to a thistle\nwith a piece of fine thread. The cow soon observed Tom’s oak-leaf hat,\nand liking the appearance of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one\nmouthful. While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her\ngreat teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared\nout as loud as he could: “Mother, mother!”",
        "“Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?” said his mother.",
        "“Here, mother,” replied he, “in the red cow’s mouth.”",
        "His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised at\nthe odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.\nFortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to\nthe ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in\nher bosom and ran home with him.",
        "Tom’s father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle\nwith, and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and\nrolled into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him up,\nand flew with him over the sea, and there dropped him.",
        "A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was\nsoon after caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they\nopened the fish in order to cook it, every one was astonished at\nfinding such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted at being free\nagain. They carried him to the king, who made Tom his dwarf, and he\nsoon grew a great favourite at court; for by his tricks and gambols he\nnot only amused the king and queen, but also all the Knights of the\nRound Table.",
        "It is said that when the king rode out on horseback, he often took Tom\nalong with him, and if a shower came on, he used to creep into his\nmajesty’s waistcoat-pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.",
        "King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if\nthey were as small as he was, and whether they were well off. Tom told\nthe king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the\ncourt, but in rather poor circumstances. On hearing this, the king\ncarried Tom to his treasury, the place where he kept all his money,\nand told him to take as much money as he could carry home to his\nparents, which made the poor little fellow caper with joy. Tom went\nimmediately to procure a purse, which was made of a water-bubble, and\nthen returned to the treasury, where be received a silver threepenny-\npiece to put into it.",
        "Our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his\nback; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and\nset forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any\naccident, and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the\nway, in two days and two nights he reached his father’s house in\nsafety.",
        "Tom had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his\nback, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet\nhim, and carried him into the house. But he soon returned to Court.",
        "As Tom’s clothes had suffered much in the batter-pudding, and the\ninside of the fish, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and\nto be mounted as a knight on a mouse.",
        "  Of Butterfly’s wings his shirt was made,\n    His boots of chicken’s hide;\n  And by a nimble fairy blade,\n  Well learned in the tailoring trade,\n    His clothing was supplied.\n  A needle dangled by his side;\n  A dapper mouse he used to ride,\n  Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!",
        "It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress and mounted\non the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and nobility, who\nwere all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancing\ncharger.",
        "The king was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little\nchair to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also\na palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in.\nHe also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.",
        "The queen was so enraged at the honours conferred on Sir Thomas that\nshe resolved to ruin him, and told the king that the little knight had\nbeen saucy to her.",
        "The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the\ndanger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he\nlay for a long time until he was almost starved with hunger; but at\nlast he ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the\nground, near the place of his concealment, he got close to it and\njumping astride on it, was carried up into the air. The butterfly flew\nwith him from tree to tree and from field to field, and at last\nreturned to the court, where the king and nobility all strove to catch\nhim; but at last poor Tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in\nwhich he was almost drowned.",
        "When the queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be\nbeheaded; and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of his\nexecution.",
        "However a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about\ntill the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.",
        "The king received Tom again into favour, which he did not live to\nenjoy, for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew\nhis sword and fought well, yet the spider’s poisonous breath at last\novercame him.",
        "  He fell dead on the ground where he stood,\n  And the spider suck’d every drop of his blood.",
        "King Arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their\nlittle favourite that they went into mourning and raised a fine white\nmarble monument over his grave with the following epitaph:",
        "  Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur’s knight,\n  Who died by a spider’s cruel bite.\n  He was well known in Arthur’s court,\n  Where he afforded gallant sport;\n  He rode at tilt and tournament,\n  And on a mouse a-hunting went.\n  Alive he filled the court with mirth;\n  His death to sorrow soon gave birth.\n  Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head\n  And cry,–Alas! Tom Thumb is dead!",
