        "A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree\nwhich bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night\none of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered\nthe gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set\nhis eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and\nin the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son\nwas ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the\nmorning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep\nwatch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm\nshould come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man\nlaid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he\nheard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of\npure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak,\nthe gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow\ndid the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail,\nand then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the\nmorning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that\nit was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king\nsaid, ’One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.’",
        "Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ’Do not shoot\nme, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is,\nand that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in\nthe evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to\neach other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go\nnot in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may\nappear to you to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to\nhimself, ’What can such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he\nshot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail\nabove its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the\nevening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of\nthese were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other\nlooked very dirty, and poor. ’I should be very silly,’ said he, ’if I\nwent to that shabby house, and left this charming place’; so he went\ninto the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the\nbird, and his country too.",
        "Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no\ntidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing\nhappened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but\nwhen he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the\nwindow where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he\ncould not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden\nbird and his country in the same manner.",
        "Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent\nhis coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he\nwould not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox,\nand heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and\ndid not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said,\n’Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and\nthe fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick\nthat their hair whistled in the wind.",
        "When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\nwas beginning his journey, and said, ’Go straight forward, till you\ncome to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast\nasleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and\npass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in\na wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not\ntry to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the\nhandsome one, otherwise you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched\nout his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they\nwent over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.",
        "Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ’It will be a\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’;\nso he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden\ncage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers\nawoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The\nnext morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it\nsentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse\nwhich could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to\nhave the golden bird given him for his own.",
        "So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ’You see now\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I\nwill still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you\nwill do as I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the\ncastle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the\ngroom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be\nsure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one\nthat is close by it.’ Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and\naway they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the\nwind.",
        "All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the\ngolden saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a\ngreat pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. ’I will give him the\ngood one,’ said he; ’I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the\ngolden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the\nguards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again\nbrought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But\nit was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess,\nhe should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own.",
        "Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said,\n’Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\no’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\nand stone till their hair whistled again.",
        "As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\no’clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her\nthe kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many\ntears that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he\nrefused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till\nat last he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house\nthe guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again.",
        "Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ’You shall\nnever have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that\nstops the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the\nwhole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven\ndays, and had done very little, the fox came and said. ’Lie down and\ngo to sleep; I will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the\nhill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now\nthat it was removed he must give him the princess.",
        "Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young\nman and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ’We will have\nall three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ’Ah!’ said the\nyoung man, ’that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’",
        "’If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ’it can be done. When you\ncome to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must\nsay, “Here she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount\nthe golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to\ntake leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift\nher quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side,\nand gallop away as fast as you can.’",
        "All went right: then the fox said, ’When you come to the castle where\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say\nthat you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden\nbird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away.’",
        "This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\ncame, and said, ’Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But\nthe young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ’I will at any rate\ngive you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the\ngallows, and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went.\n’Well,’ thought the young man, ’it is no hard matter to keep that\nadvice.’",
        "He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village\nwhere he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise\nand uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said,\n’Two men are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the\ntwo men were his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ’Cannot\nthey in any way be saved?’ But the people said ’No,’ unless he would\nbestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he\ndid not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and\nhis brothers were given up, and went on with him towards their home.",
        "And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ’Let us sit down by the\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\n’Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and\nwent home to the king their master, and said. ’All this have we won by\nour labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would\nnot eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.",
        "The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so\nsteep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once\nmore, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil\nwould have befallen him: ’Yet,’ said he, ’I cannot leave you here, so\nlay hold of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the\nriver, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, ’Your brothers have\nset watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed\nhimself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was\nscarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to\nsing, and princess left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and\ntold him all his brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished,\nand he had the princess given to him again; and after the king’s death\nhe was heir to his kingdom.",
        "A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old\nfox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and\ncut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.",
