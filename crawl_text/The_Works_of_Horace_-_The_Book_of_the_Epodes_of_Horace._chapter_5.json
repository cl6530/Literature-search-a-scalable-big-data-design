        "TO MAECENAS.",
        "Thou wilt go, my friend Maecenas, with Liburian galleys among the\ntowering forts of ships, ready at thine own [hazard] to undergo any of\nCaesar’s dangers. What shall I do? To whom life may be agreeable, if you\nsurvive; but, if otherwise, burdensome. Whether shall I, at your\ncommand, pursue my ease, which can not be pleasing unless in your\ncompany? Or shall I endure this toil with such a courage, as becomes\neffeminate men to bear? I will bear it? and with an intrepid soul follow\nyou, either through the summits of the Alps, and the inhospitable\nCaucus, or to the furthest western bay. You may ask how I, unwarlike and\ninfirm, can assist your labors by mine? While I am your companion, I\nshall be in less anxiety, which takes possession of the absent in a\ngreater measure. As the bird, that has unfledged young, is in a greater\ndread of serpents’ approaches, when they are left;–not that, if she\nshould be present when they came, she could render more help. Not only\nthis, but every other war, shall be cheerfully embraced by me for the\nhope of your favor; [and this,] not that my plows should labor, yoked to\na greater number of mine own oxen; or that my cattle before the\nscorching dog-star should change the Calabrian for the Lucanian\npastures: neither that my white country-box should equal the Circaean\nwalls of lofty Tusculum. Your generosity has enriched me enough, and\nmore than enough: I shall never wish to amass, what either, like the\nmiser Chremes, I may bury in the earth, or luxuriously squander, like a\nprodigal.",

        "THE PRAISES OF A COUNTRY LIFE.",
        "Happy the man, who, remote from business, after the manner of the\nancient race of mortals, cultivates his paternal lands with his own\noxen, disengaged from every kind of usury; he is neither alarmed by the\nhorrible trump, as a soldier, nor dreads he the angry sea; he shuns both\nthe bar and the proud portals of citizens in power. Wherefore he either\nweds the lofty poplars to the mature branches of the vine; and, lopping\noff the useless boughs with his pruning-knife, he ingrafts more fruitful\nones: or he takes a prospect of the herds of his lowing cattle,\nwandering about in a lonely vale; or stores his honey, pressed [from the\ncombs], in clean vessels; or shears his tender sheep. Or, when autumn\nhas lifted up in the fields his head adorned with mellow fruits, how\ndoes he rejoice, while he gathers the grafted pears, and the grape that\nvies with the purple, with which he may recompense thee, O Priapus, and\nthee, father Sylvanus, guardian of his boundaries! Sometimes he delights\nto lie under an aged holm, sometimes on the matted grass: meanwhile the\nwaters glide along in their deep channels; the birds warble in the\nwoods; and the fountains murmur with their purling streams, which\ninvites gentle slumbers. But when the wintery season of the tempestuous\nair prepares rains and snows, he either drives the fierce boars, with\nmany a dog, into the intercepting toils; or spreads his thin nets with\nthe smooth pole, as a snare for the voracious thrushes; or catches in\nhis gin the timorous hare, or that stranger the crane, pleasing rewards\n[for his labor]. Among such joys as these, who does not forget those\nmischievous anxieties, which are the property of love. But if a chaste\nwife, assisting on her part [in the management] of the house, and\nbeloved children (such as is the Sabine, or the sun-burned spouse of the\nindustrious Apulian), piles up the sacred hearth with old wood, just at\nthe approach of her weary husband; and, shutting up the fruitful cattle\nin the woven hurdles, milks dry their distended udders: and, drawing\nthis year’s wine out of a well-seasoned cask, prepares the unbought\ncollation: not the Lucrine oysters could delight me more, nor the\nturbot, nor the scar, should the tempestuous winter drive any from the\neastern floods to this sea: not the turkey, nor the Asiatic wild-fowl,\ncan come into my stomach more agreeably, than the olive gathered from\nthe richest branches from the trees, or the sorrel that loves the\nmeadows, or mallows salubrious for a sickly body, or a lamb slain at the\nfeast of Terminus, or a kid rescued from the wolf. Amid these dainties,\nhow it pleases one to see the well-fed sheep hastening home! to see the\nweary oxen, with drooping neck, dragging the inverted ploughshare! and\nslaves, the test of a rich family, ranged about the smiling household\ngods! When Alfius, the usurer, now on the point of turning countryman,\nhad said this, he collected in all his money on the Ides; and endeavors\nto put it out again at the Calends.",
        "ODE III.",
        "TO MAECENAS.",
        "If any person at any time with an impious hand has broken his aged\nfather’s neck, let him eat garlic, more baneful than hemlock. Oh! the\nhardy bowels of the mowers! What poison is this that rages in my\nentrails? Has viper’s blood, infused in these herbs, deceived me? Or has\nCanidia dressed this baleful food? When Medea, beyond all the [other]\nargonauts, admired their handsome leader, she anointed Jason with this,\nas he was going to tie the untried yoke on the bulls: and having\nrevenged herself on [Jason’s] mistress, by making her presents besmeared\nwith this, she flew away on her winged dragon. Never did the steaming\ninfluence of any constellation so raging as this rest upon the thirsty\nAppulia: neither did the gift [_of Dejanira] burn hotter upon the\nshoulders of laborious Hercules. But if ever, facetious Maecenas, you\nshould have a desire for any such stuff again, I wish that your girl may\noppose her hand to your kiss, and lie at the furthest part of the bed.",
        "ODE IV.",
        "TO MENAS.",
        "As great an enmity as is allotted by nature to wolves and lambs, [so\ngreat a one] have I to you, you that are galled at your back with\nSpanish cords, and on your legs with the hard fetter. Though,\npurse-proud with your riches, you strut along, yet fortune does not\nalter your birth. Do you not observe while you are stalking along the\nsacred way with a robe twice three ells long, how the most open\nindignation of those that pass and repass turns their looks on thee?\nThis fellow, [say they,] cut with the triumvir’s whips, even till the\nbeadle was sick of his office, plows a thousand acres of Falernian land,\nand wears out the Appian road with his nags; and, in despite of Otho,\nsits in the first rows [of the circus] as a knight of distinction. To\nwhat purpose is it, that so many brazen-beaked ships of immense bulk\nshould be led out against pirates and a band of slaves, while this\nfellow, this is a military tribune?",
        "ODE V.",
        "THE WITCHES MANGLING A BOY.",
        "But oh, by all the gods in heaven, who rule the earth and human race,\nwhat means this tumult? And what the hideous looks of all these [hags,\nfixed] upon me alone? I conjure thee by thy children (if invoked Lucina\nwas ever present at any real birth of thine), I [conjure] thee by this\nempty honor of my purple, by Jupiter, who must disapprove these\nproceedings, why dost thou look at me as a step-mother, or as a wild\nbeast stricken with a dart? While the boy made these complaints with a\nfaltering voice, he stood with his bandages of distinction taken from\nhim, a tender frame, such as might soften the impious breasts of the\ncruel Thracians; Canidia, having interwoven her hair and uncombed head\nwith little vipers, orders wild fig-trees torn up from graves, orders\nfuneral cypresses and eggs besmeared with the gore of a loathsome toad,\nand feathers of the nocturnal screech-owl, and those herbs, which\nlolchos, and Spain, fruitful in poisons, transmits, and bones snatched\nfrom the mouth of a hungry bitch, to be burned in Colchian flames. But\nSagana, tucked up for expedition, sprinkling the waters of Avernus all\nover the house, bristles up with her rough hair like a sea-urchin, or a\nboar in the chase. Veia, deterred by no remorse of conscience, groaning\nwith the toil, dug up the ground with the sharp spade; where the boy,\nfixed in, might long be tormented to death at the sight of food varied\ntwo or three times in a day: while he stood out with his face, just as\nmuch at bodies suspended by the chin [in swimming] project from the\nwater, that his parched marrow and dried liver might be a charm for\nlove; when once the pupils of his eyes had wasted away, fixed on the\nforbidden food. Both the idle Naples, and every neighboring town\nbelieved, that Folia of Ariminum, [a witch] of masculine lust, was not\nabsent: she, who with her Thessalian incantations forces the charmed\nstars and the moon from heaven. Here the fell Canidia, gnawing her\nunpaired thumb with her livid teeth, what said she? or what did she not\nsay? O ye faithful witnesses to my proceedings, Night and Diana, who\npresidest over silence, when the secret rites are celebrated: now, now\nbe present, now turn your anger and power against the houses of our\nenemies, while the savage wild beasts lie hid in the woods, dissolved in\nsweet repose; let the dogs of Suburra (which may be matter of ridicule\nfor every body) bark at the aged profligate, bedaubed with ointment,\nsuch as my hands never made any more exquisite. What is the matter? Why\nare these compositions less efficacious than those of the barbarian\nMedea? by means of which she made her escape, after having revenged\nherself on [Jason’s] haughty mistress, the daughter of the mighty Creon;\nwhen the garment, a gift that was injected with venom, took off his new\nbride by its inflammatory power. And yet no herb, nor root hidden in\ninaccessible places, ever escaped my notice. [Nevertheless,] he sleeps\nin the perfumed bed of every harlot, from his forgetfulness [of me]. Ah!\nah! he walks free [from my power] by the charms of some more knowing\nwitch. Varus, (oh you that will shortly have much to lament!) you shall\ncome back to me by means of unusual spells; nor shall you return to\nyourself by all the power of Marsian enchantments, I will prepare a\nstronger philter: I will pour in a stronger philter for you, disdainful\nas you are; and the heaven shall subside below the sea, with the earth\nextended over it, sooner than you shall not burn with love for me, in\nthe same manner as this pitch [burns] in the sooty flames. At these\nwords, the boy no longer [attempted], as before, to move the impious\nhags by soothing expressions; but, doubtful in what manner he should\nbreak silence, uttered Thyestean imprecations. Potions [said he] have a\ngreat efficacy in confounding right and wrong, but are not able to\ninvert the condition of human nature; I will persecute you with curses;\nand execrating detestation is not to be expiated by any victim.\nMoreover, when doomed to death I shall have expired, I will attend you\nas a nocturnal fury; and, a ghost, I will attack your faces with my\nhooked talons (for such is the power of those divinities, the Manes),\nand, brooding upon your restless breasts, I will deprive you of repose\nby terror. The mob, from village to village, assaulting you on every\nside with stones, shall demolish you filthy hags. Finally, the wolves\nand Esquiline vultures shall scatter abroad your unburied limbs. Nor\nshall this spectacle escape the observation of my parents, who, alas!\nmust survive me.",
        "Ode. VI.",
        "AGAINST CASSIUS SEVERUS.",
        "O cur, thou coward against wolves, why dost thou persecute innocent\nstrangers? Why do you not, if you can, turn your empty yelpings hither,\nand attack me, who will bite again? For, like a Molossian, or tawny\nLaconian dog, that is a friendly assistant to shepherds, I will drive\nwith erected ears through the deep snows every brute that shall go\nbefore me. You, when you have filled the grove with your fearful\nbarking, you smell at the food that is thrown to you. Have a care, have\na care; for, very bitter against bad men, I exert my ready horns uplift;\nlike him that was rejected as a son-in-law by the perfidious Lycambes,\nor the sharp enemy of Bupalus. What, if any cur attack me with malignant\ntooth, shall I, without revenge, blubber like a boy?",

        "TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE.",
        "Whither, whither, impious men are you rushing? Or why are the swords\ndrawn, that were [so lately] sheathed? Is there too little of Roman\nblood spilled upon land and sea? [And this,] not that the Romans might\nburn the proud towers of envious Carthage, or that the Britons, hitherto\nunassailed, might go down the sacred way bound in chains: but that,\nagreeably to the wishes of the Parthians, this city may fall by its own\nmight. This custom [of warfare] never obtained even among either wolves\nor savage lions, unless against a different species. Does blind phrenzy,\nor your superior valor, or some crime, hurry you on at this rate? Give\nanswer. They are silent: and wan paleness infects their countenances,\nand their stricken souls are stupefied. This is the case: a cruel\nfatality and the crime of fratricide have disquieted the Romans, from\nthat time when the blood of the innocent Remus, to be expiated by his\ndescendants, was spilled upon the earth.",
        "ODE VIII.",
        "UPON A WANTON OLD WOMAN.",
        "Can you, grown rank with lengthened age, ask what unnerves my vigor?\nWhen your teeth are black, and old age withers your brow with wrinkles:\nand your back sinks between your staring hip-bones, like that of an\nunhealthy cow. But, forsooth! your breast and your fallen chest, full\nwell resembling a broken-backed horse, provoke me; and a body flabby,\nand feeble knees supported by swollen legs. May you be happy: and may\ntriumphal statues adorn your funeral procession; and may no matron\nappear in public abounding with richer pearls. What follows, because the\nStoic treatises sometimes love to be on silken pillows? Are unlearned\nconstitutions the less robust? Or are their limbs less stout? But for\nyou to raise an appetite, in a stomach that is nice, it is necessary\nthat you exert every art of language.",
        "ODE IX.",
        "TO MAECENAS.",
        "When, O happy Maecenas, shall I, overjoyed at Caesar’s being victorious,\ndrink with you under the stately dome (for so it pleases Jove) the\nCaecuban reserved for festal entertainments, while the lyre plays a\ntune, accompanied with flutes, that in the Doric, these in the Phrygian\nmeasure? As lately, when the Neptunian admiral, driven from the sea,\nand his navy burned, fled, after having menaced those chains to Rome,\nwhich, like a friend, he had taken off from perfidious slaves. The Roman\nsoldiers (alas! ye, our posterity, will deny the fact), enslaved to a\nwoman, carry palisadoes and arms, and can be subservient to haggard\neunuchs; and among the military standards, oh shame! the sun beholds an\n[Egyptian] canopy. Indignant at this the Gauls turned two thousand of\ntheir cavalry, proclaiming Caesar; and the ships of the hostile navy,\ngoing off to the left, lie by in port. Hail, god of triumph! Dost thou\ndelay the golden chariots and untouched heifers? Hail, god of triumph!\nYou neither brought back a general equal [to Caesar] from the Jugurthine\nwar; nor from the African [war, him], whose valor raised him a monument\nover Carthage. Our enemy, overthrown both by land and sea, has changed\nhis purple vestments for mourning. He either seeks Crete, famous for her\nhundred cities, ready to sail with unfavorable winds; or the Syrtes,\nharassed by the south; or else is driven by the uncertain sea. Bring\nhither, boy, larger bowls, and the Chian or Lesbian wine; or, what may\ncorrect this rising qualm of mine, fill me out the Caecuban. It is my\npleasure to dissipate care and anxiety for Caesar’s danger with\ndelicious wine.",

        "AGAINST MAEVIUS.",
        "The vessel that carries the loathsome Maevius, makes her departure under\nan unlucky omen. Be mindful, O south wind, that you buffet it about with\nhorrible billows. May the gloomy east, turning up the sea, disperse its\ncables and broken oars. Let the north arise as mighty as when be rives\nthe quivering oaks on the lofty mountains; nor let a friendly star\nappear through the murky night, in which the baleful Orion sets: nor let\nhim be conveyed in a calmer sea, than was the Grecian band of\nconquerors, when Pallas turned her rage from burned Troy to the ship of\nimpious Ajax. Oh what a sweat is coming upon your sailors, and what a\nsallow paleness upon you, and that effeminate wailing, and those prayers\nto unregarding Jupiter; when the Ionian bay, roaring with the\ntempestuous south-west, shall break your keel. But if, extended along\nthe winding shore, you shall delight the cormorants as a dainty prey, a\nlascivious he-goat and an ewe-lamb shall be sacrificed to the Tempests.",

        "TO PECTIUS.",
        "It by no means, O Pectius, delights me as heretofore to write Lyric\nverses, being smitten with cruel love: with love, who takes pleasure to\ninflame me beyond others, either youths or maidens. This is the third\nDecember that has shaken the [leafy] honors from the woods, since I\nceased to be mad for Inachia. Ah me! (for I am ashamed of so great a\nmisfortune) what a subject of talk was I throughout the city! I repent\ntoo of the entertainments, at which both a languishing and silence and\nsighs, heaved from the bottom of my breast, discovered the lover. As\nsoon as the indelicate god [Bacchus] by the glowing wine had removed, as\nI grew warm, the secrets of [my heart] from their repository, I made my\ncomplaints, lamenting to you, “Has the fairest genius of a poor man no\nweight against wealthy lucre? Wherefore, if a generous indignation boil\nin my breast, insomuch as to disperse to the winds these disagreeable\napplications, that give no ease to the desperate wound; the shame [of\nbeing overcome] ending, shall cease to contest with rivals of such a\nsort.” When I, with great gravity, had applauded these resolutions in\nyour presence, being ordered to go home, I was carried with a wandering\nfoot to posts, alas! to me not friendly, and alas! obdurate gates,\nagainst which I bruised my loins and side. Now my affections for the\ndelicate Lyciscus engross all my time; from them neither the unreserved\nadmonitions, nor the serious reprehensions of other friends can recall\nme [to my former taste for poetry]; but, perhaps, either a new flame for\nsome fair damsel, or for some graceful youth who binds his long hair in\na knot, [may do so].",

        "TO A WOMAN WHOSE CHARMS WERE OVER.",
        "What would you be at, you woman fitter for the swarthy monsters? Why do\nyou send tokens, why billet-doux to me, and not to some vigorous youth,\nand of a taste not nice? For I am one who discerns a polypus, or fetid\nramminess, however concealed, more quickly than the keenest dog the\ncovert of the boar. What sweatiness, and how rank an odor every where\nrises from her withered limbs! when she strives to lay her furious rage\nwith impossibilities; now she has no longer the advantage of moist\ncosmetics, and her color appears as if stained with crocodile’s ordure;\nand now, in wild impetuosity, she tears her bed, bedding, and all she\nhas. She attacks even my loathings in the most angry terms:–\"You are\nalways less dull with Inachia than me: in her company you are threefold\ncomplaisance; but you are ever unprepared to oblige me in a single\ninstance. Lesbia, who first recommended you–so unfit a help in time of\nneed–may she come to an ill end! when Coan Amyntas paid me his\naddresses; who is ever as constant in his fair one’s service, as the\nyoung tree to the hill it grows on. For whom were labored the fleeces of\nthe richest Tyrian dye? For you? Even so that there was not one in\ncompany, among gentlemen of your own rank, whom his own wife admired\npreferably to you: oh, unhappy me, whom you fly, as the lamb dreads the\nfierce wolves, or the she-goats the lions!”",

        "TO A FRIEND.",
        "A horrible tempest has condensed the sky, and showers and snows bring\ndown the atmosphere: now the sea, now the woods bellow with the Thracian\nNorth wind. Let us, my friends, take occasion from the day; and while\nour knees are vigorous, and it becomes us, let old age with his\ncontracted forehead become smooth. Do you produce the wine, that was\npressed in the consulship of my Torquatus. Forbear to talk of any other\nmatters. The deity, perhaps, will reduce these [present evils], to your\nformer [happy] state by a propitious change. Now it is fitting both to\nbe bedewed with Persian perfume, and to relieve our breasts of dire\nvexations by the lyre, sacred to Mercury. Like as the noble Centaur,\n[Chiron,] sung to his mighty pupil: “Invincible mortal, son of the\ngoddess Thetis, the land of Assaracus awaits you, which the cold\ncurrents of little Scamander and swift-gliding Simois divide: whence the\nfatal sisters have broken off your return, by a thread that cannot be\naltered: nor shall your azure mother convey you back to your home. There\n[then] by wine and music, sweet consolations, drive away every symptom\nof hideous melancholy.”",

        "TO MAECENAS.",
        "You kill me, my courteous Maecenas, by frequently inquiring, why a\nsoothing indolence has diffused as great a degree of forgetfulness on my\ninmost senses, as if I had imbibed with a thirsty throat the cups that\nbring on Lethean slumbers. For the god, the god prohibits me from\nbringing to a conclusion the verses I promised [you, namely those]\niambics which I had begun. In the same manner they report that Anacreon\nof Teios burned for the Samian Bathyllus; who often lamented his love to\nan inaccurate measure on a hollow lyre. You are violently in love\nyourself; but if a fairer flame did not burn besieged Troy, rejoice in\nyour lot. Phryne, a freed-woman, and not content with a single admirer,\nconsumes me.",

O Neaera, who shall one day greatly grieve on account of my\nmerit: for, if there is any thing of manhood in Horace, he will not\nendure that you should dedicate your nights continually to another, whom\nyou prefer; and exasperated, he will look out for one who will return\nhis love; and though an unfeigned sorrow should take possession of you,\nyet my firmness shall not give way to that beauty which has once given\nme disgust. But as for you, whoever you be who are more successful [than\nme], and now strut proud of my misfortune; though you be rich in flocks\nand abundance of land, and Pactolus flow for you, nor the mysteries of\nPythagoras, born again, escape you, and you excel Nireus in beauty;\nalas! you shall [hereafter] bewail her love transferred elsewhere; but I\nshall laugh in my turn.",

Whom neither the bordering Marsi could destroy, nor\nthe Etrurian band of the menacing Porsena, nor the rival valor of Capua,\nnor the bold Spartacus, and the Gauls perfideous with their innovations;\nnor did the fierce Germany subdue with its blue-eyed youth, nor Annibal,\ndetested by parents; but we, an impious race, whose blood is devoted to\nperdition, shall destroy her: and this land shall again be possessed by\nwild beasts. The victorious barbarian, alas! shall trample upon the\nashes of the city, and the horsemen shall smite it with the sounding\nhoofs; and (horrible to see!) he shall insultingly disperse the bones of\nRomulus, which [as yet] are free from the injuries of wind and sun.\nPerhaps you all in general, or the better part of you, are inquisitive\nto know, what may be expedient, in order to escape [such] dreadful\nevils. There can be no determination better than this; namely, to go\nwherever our feet will carry us, wherever the south or boisterous\nsouth-west shall summon us through the waves; in the same manner as the\nstate of the Phocaeans fled, after having uttered execrations [against\nsuch as should return], and left their fields and proper dwellings and\ntemples to be inhabited by boars and ravenous wolves. Is this\nagreeable? has any one a better scheme to advise? Why do we delay to go\non ship-board under an auspicious omen? But first let us swear to these\nconditions–the stones shall swim upward, lifted from the bottom of the\nsea, as soon as it shall not be impious to return; nor let it grieve us\nto direct our sails homeward, when the Po shall wash the tops of the\nMatinian summits; or the lofty Apennine shall remove into the sea, or a\nmiraculous appetite shall unite monsters by a strange kind of lust;\nInsomuch that tigers may delight to couple with hinds, and the dove be\npolluted with the kite; nor the simple herds may dread the brindled\nlions, and the he-goat, grown smooth, may love the briny main. After\nhaving sworn to these things, and whatever else may cut off the\npleasing: hope of returning, let us go, the whole city of us, or at\nleast that part which is superior to the illiterate mob: let the idle\nand despairing part remain upon these inauspicious habitations. Ye, that\nhave bravery, away with effeminate grief, and fly beyond the Tuscan\nshore. The ocean encircling the land awaits us; let us seek the happy\nplains and prospering Islands, where the untilled land yearly produces\ncorn, and the unpruned vineyard punctually flourishes; and where the\nbranch of the never-failing olive blossoms forth, and the purple fig\nadorns its native tree: honey distills from the hollow oaks; the light\nwater bounds down from the high mountains with a murmuring pace. There\nthe she-goats come to the milk-pails of their own accord, and the\nfriendly flock return with their udders distended; nor does the bear at\nevening growl about the sheepfold, nor does the rising ground swell with\nvipers; and many more things shall we, happy [Romans], view with\nadmiration: how neither the rainy east lays waste the corn-fields with\nprofuse showers, nor is the fertile seed burned by a dry glebe; the king\nof gods moderating both [extremes]. The pine rowed by the Argonauts\nnever attempted to come hither; nor did the lascivious [Medea] of\nColchis set her foot [in this place]: hither the Sidonian mariners never\nturned their sail-yards, nor the toiling crew of Ulysses. No contagious\ndistempers hurt the flocks; nor does the fiery violence of any\nconstellation scorch the herd. Jupiter set apart these shores for a\npious people, when he debased the golden age with brass: with brass,\nthen with iron he hardened the ages; from which there shall be a happy\nescape for the good, according to my predictions.",

        "Now, now I yield to powerful science; and suppliant beseech thee by the\ndominions of Proserpine, and by the inflexible divinity of Diana, and by\nthe books of incantations able to call down the stars displaced from the\nfirmament; O Canidia, at length desist from thine imprecations, and\nquickly turn, turn back thy magical machine. Telephus moved [with\ncompassion] the grandson of Nereus, against whom he arrogantly had put\nhis troops of Mysians in battle-array, and against whom he had darted\nhis sharp javelins. The Trojan matrons embalmed the body of the\nman-slaying Hector, which had been condemned to birds of prey, and dogs,\nafter king [Priam], having left the walls of the city, prostrated\nhimself, alas! at the feet of the obstinate Achilles. The mariners of\nthe indefatigable Ulysses, put off their limbs, bristled with the hard\nskins [of swine], at the will of Circe: then their reason and voice were\nrestored, and their former comeliness to their countenances. I have\nsuffered punishment enough, and more than enough, on thy account, O thou\nso dearly beloved by the sailors and factors. My vigor is gone away, and\nmy ruddy complexion has left me; my bones are covered with a ghastly\nskin; my hair with your preparations is grown hoary. No ease respites me\nfrom my sufferings: night presses upon day, and day upon night: nor is\nit in my power to relieve my lungs, which are strained with gasping.\nWherefore, wretch that I am, I am compelled to credit (what was denied,\nby me) that the charms of the Samnites discompose the breast, and the\nhead splits in sunder at the Marsian incantations. What wouldst thou\nhave more? O sea! O earth! I burn in such a degree as neither Hercules\ndid, besmeared with the black gore of Nessus, nor the fervid flame\nburning In the Sicilian Aetna. Yet you, a laboratory of Colchian\npoisons, remain on fire, till I [reduced to] a dry ember, shall be\nwafted away by the injurious winds. What event, or what penalty awaits\nme? Speak out: I will with honor pay the demanded mulct; ready to make\nan expiation, whether you should require a hundred steers, or chose to\nbe celebrated on a lying lyre. You, a woman of modesty, you, a woman of\nprobity, shall traverse the stars, as a golden constellation. Castor and\nthe brother of the great Castor, offended at the infamy brought on\n[their sister] Helen, yet overcome by entreaty, restored to the poet his\neyes that were taken away from him. And do you (for it is in your power)\nextricate me from this frenzy; O you, that are neither defiled by family\nmeanness, nor skillful to disperse the ashes of poor people, after they\nhave been nine days interred. You have an hospitable breast, and\nunpolluted hands; and Pactumeius is your son, and thee the midwife has\ntended; and, whenever you bring forth, you spring up with unabated\nvigor.",

        "Why do you pour forth your entreaties to ears that are closely shut\n[against them]? The wintery ocean, with its briny tempests, does not\nlash rocks more deaf to the cries of the naked mariners. What, shall\nyou, without being made an example of, deride the Cotyttian mysteries,\nsacred to unrestrained love, which were divulged [by you]? And shall\nyou, [assuming the office] of Pontiff [with regard to my] Esquilian\nincantations, fill the city with my name unpunished? What did it avail\nme to have enriched the Palignian sorceress [with my charms], and to\nhave prepared poison of greater expedition, if a slower fate awaits you\nthan is agreeable to my wishes? An irksome life shall be protracted by\nyou, wretch as you are, for this purpose, that you may perpetually be\nable to endure new tortures. Tantalus, the perfidious sire of Pelops,\never craving after the plenteous banquet [which is always before him],\nwishes for respite; Prometheus, chained to the vulture, wishes [for\nrest]; Sisyphus wishes to place the stone on the summit of the mountain:\nbut the laws of Jupiter forbid. Thus you shall desire at one time to\nleap down from a high tower, at another to lay open your breast with the\nNoric sword; and, grieving with your tedious indisposition, shall tie\nnooses about your neck in vain. I at that time will ride on your odious\nshoulders; and the whole earth shall acknowledge my unexampled power.\nWhat shall I who can give motion to waxen images (as you yourself,\ninquisitive as you are, were convinced of) and snatch the moon from\nheaven by my incantations; I, who can raise the dead after they are\nburned, and duly prepare the potion of love, shall I bewail the event of\nmy art having no efficacy upon you?",
        "THE SECULAR POEM OF HORACE.",
        "TO APOLLO AND DIANA.",
        "Phoebus, and thou Diana, sovereign of the woods, ye illustrious\nornaments of the heavens, oh ever worthy of adoration, and ever adored,\nbestow what we pray for at this sacred season: at which the Sibylline\nverses have given directions, that select virgins and chaste youths\nshould sing a hymn to the deities, to whom the seven hills [of Rome] are\nacceptable. O genial sun, who in your splendid car draw forth and\nobscure the day, and who arise another and the same, may it never be in\nyour power to behold anything more glorious than the city of Rome! O\nIlithyia, of lenient power to produce the timely birth, protect the\nmatrons [in labor]; whether you choose the title of Lucina, or\nGenitalis. O goddess multiply our offspring; and prosper the decrees of\nthe senate in relation to the joining of women in wedlock, and the\nmatrimonial law about to teem with a new race; that the stated\nrevolution of a hundred and ten years may bring back the hymns and the\ngames, three times by bright daylight restored to in crowds, and as\noften in the welcome night. And you, ye fatal sisters, infallible in\nhaving predicted what is established, and what the settled order of\nthings preserves, add propitious fates to those already past. Let the\nearth, fertile in fruits and flocks, present Ceres with a sheafy crown;\nmay both salubrious rains and Jove’s air cherish the young blood!\nApollo, mild and gentle with your sheathed arrows, hear the suppliant\nyouths: O moon, thou horned queen of stars, hear the virgins. If Rome be\nyour work, and the Trojan troops arrived on the Tuscan shore (the part,\ncommanded [by your oracles] to change their homes and city) by a\nsuccessful navigation: for whom pious Aeneas, surviving his country,\nsecured a free passage through Troy, burning not by his treachery, about\nto give them more ample possessions than those that were left behind. O\nye deities, grant to the tractable youth probity of manners; to old age,\nye deities, grant a pleasing retirement; to the Roman people, wealth,\nand progeny, and every kind of glory. And may the illustrious issue of\nAnchises and Venus, who worships you with [offerings of] white bulls,\nreign superior to the warring enemy, merciful to the prostrate. Now the\nParthian, by sea and land, dreads our powerful forces and the Roman\naxes: now the Scythians beg [to know] our commands, and the Indians but\nlately so arrogant. Now truth, and peace, and honor, and ancient\nmodesty, and neglected virtue dare to return, and happy plenty appears,\nwith her horn full to the brim. Phoebus, the god of augury, and\nconspicuous for his shining bow, and dear to the nine muses, who by his\nsalutary art soothes the wearied limbs of the body; if he, propitious,\nsurveys the Palatine altars–may he prolong the Roman affairs, and the\nhappy state of Italy to another lustrum, and to an improving age. And\nmay Diana, who possesses Mount Aventine and Algidus, regard the prayers\nof the Quindecemvirs, and lend a gracious ear to the supplications of\nthe youths. We, the choir taught to sing the praises of Phoebus and\nDiana, bear home with us a good and certain hope, that Jupiter, and all\nthe other gods, are sensible of these our supplications.",
