        "Tintern Abbey is situated in a level valley, surrounded on all sides by\nhigh green pastures and wooded hills, at the bottom of which the\nglorious river Wye glides in its circuitous course to the sea. The abbey\nis said to share with Melrose the distinction of being the most\npicturesque and beautiful ecclesiastical ruin in Great Britain. When the\nsun is setting, or better still, under the mystic light of the harvest\nmoon, the picture formed by the roofless abbey in its perfect setting,\nneeds a Wordsworth to do it justice.",
        "An abbey for Cistercian monks was established on this spot in 1131 by\nWalter Fitz-Richard de Clare and dedicated to St. Mary. None of this\nbuilding remains, as the whole edifice was rebuilt about 1260. The chief\npart of the ruins, now standing, is the church, though in 1847, when\nexcavations were being carried on in an adjoining orchard, the remains\nof the Hospitium were discovered. This was an oblong building, supported\non pillars, in which it was the custom for the monks to entertain\nstrangers or travellers of their order. In the middle of the nave are\nthe four arches which supported the tower, now mere skeletons, yet\nsufficiently preserved to show their form. The walls are nearly\ncomplete, and many of the columns still stand, as well as the bases of\nthose whioh have fallen. All the pavement has disappeared, and the whole\nof the former floor is reduced to one level, now carpeted with turf.",
        "The church is cruciform in plan and measures 228 feet from east to west.\nThe remains of the dormitory, chapter-house, cloisters, and the\nrefectory, which still has its lectern for the use of the reader during\nmeals, are to be found on the north side of the church. Walking on the\nwalls is forbidden. The vast extent of the ruins of the Hospitium\nrecalls the fact that Tintern Abbey was for a long period distinguished\nfor its luxurious style of living and its great hospitality.",
