I am\nunacquainted with military science, so my treatment of the War was\nlimited to an estimate of the characters of the antagonists.\nThe character of Germany and the Germans is a riddle. I have seen no\nconvincing solution of it by any Englishman, and hardly any confident\nattempt at a solution which did not speak the uncontrolled language of\npassion. There is the same difficulty with the lower animals; our\ndescription of them tends to be a description of nothing but our own\nloves and hates. Who has ever fathomed the mind of a rhinoceros; or has\nremembered, while he faces the beast, that a good rhinoceros is a\npleasant member of the community in which his life is passed? We see\nonly the folded hide, the horn, and the angry little eye. We know that\nhe is strong and cunning, and that his desires and instincts are\ninconsistent with our welfare. Yet a rhinoceros is a simpler creature\nthan a German, and does not trouble our thought by conforming, on\noccasion, to civilized standards and humane conditions.\nIt seems unreasonable to lay great stress on racial differences. The\ninsuperable barrier that divides England from Germany has grown out of\ncircumstance and habit and thought. For many hundreds of years the\nGerman peoples have stood to arms in their own defence against the\nencroachments of successive empires; and modern Germany learned the\ndoctrine of the omnipotence of force by prolonged suffering at the hands\nof the greatest master of that immoral school–the Emperor Napoleon. No\nGerman can understand the attitude of disinterested patronage which the\nEnglish mind quite naturally assumes when it is brought into contact\nwith foreigners. The best example of this superiority of attitude is to\nbe seen in the people who are called pacifists. They are a peculiarly\nEnglish type, and they are the most arrogant of all the English. The\nidea that they should ever have to fight for their lives is to them\nsupremely absurd. There must be some mistake, they think, which can be\neasily remedied once it is pointed out. Their title to existence is so\nclear to themselves that they are convinced it will be universally\nrecognized; it must not be made a matter of international conflict.\nPartly, no doubt, this belief is fostered by lack of imagination. The\nsheltered conditions and leisured life which they enjoy as the parasites\nof a dominant race have produced in them a false sense of security. But\nthere is something also of the English strength and obstinacy of\ncharacter in their self-confidence, and if ever Germany were to conquer\nEngland some of them would spring to their full stature as the heroes of\nan age-long and indomitable resistance. They are not held in much esteem\nto-day among their own people; they are useless for the work in hand;\nand their credit has suffered from the multitude of pretenders who make\nprinciple a cover for cowardice. But for all that, they are kin to the\nmakers of England, and the fact that Germany would never tolerate them\nfor an instant is not without its lesson.\nWe shall never understand the Germans. Some of their traits may possibly\nbe explained by their history. Their passionate devotion to the State,\ntheir amazing vulgarity, their worship of mechanism and mechanical\nefficiency, are explicable in a people who are not strong in individual\ncharacter, who have suffered much to achieve union, and who have\nachieved it by subordinating themselves, soul and body, to a brutal\ntaskmaster. But the convulsions of war have thrown up things that are\ndeeper than these, primaeval things, which, until recently, civilization\nwas believed to have destroyed. The old monstrous gods who gave their\nnames to the days of the week are alive again in Germany. The English\nsoldier of to-day goes into action with the cold courage of a man who is\nprepared to make the best of a bad job. The German soldier sacrifices\nhimself, in a frenzy of religious exaltation, to the War-God. The\nfilthiness that the Germans use, their deliberate befouling of all that\nis elegant and gracious and antique, their spitting into the food that\nis to be eaten by their prisoners, their defiling with ordure the sacred\nvessels in the churches–all these things, too numerous and too\nmonotonous to describe, are not the instinctive coarsenesses of the\nbrute beast; they are a solemn ritual of filth, religiously practised,\nby officers no less than by men. The waves of emotional exaltation which\nfrom time to time pass over the whole people have the same character,\nthe character of savage religion.\nIf they are alien to civilization when they fight, they are doubly alien\nwhen they reason. They are glib and fluent in the use of the terms which\nhave been devised for the needs of thought and argument, but their use\nof these terms is empty, and exhibits all the intellectual processes\nwith the intelligence left out. I know nothing more distressing than the\nattempt to follow any German argument concerning the War. If it were\nmerely wrong-headed, cunning, deceitful, there might still be some\ncompensation in its cleverness. There is no such compensation. The\nstatements made are not false, but empty; the arguments used are not\nbad, but meaningless. It is as if they despised language, and made use\nof it only because they believe that it is an instrument of deceit. But\na man who has no respect for language cannot possibly use it in such a\nmanner as to deceive others, especially if those others are accustomed\nto handle it delicately and powerfully. It ought surely to be easy to\napologize for a war that commands the whole-hearted support of a nation;\nbut no apology worthy of the name has been produced in Germany. The\npleadings which have been used are servile things, written to order, and\ndirected to some particular address, as if the truth were of no\nimportance. No one of these appeals has produced any appreciable effect\non the minds of educated Frenchmen, or Englishmen, or Americans, even\namong those who are eager to hear all that the enemy has to say for\nhimself. This is a strange thing; and is perhaps the widest breach of\nall. We are hopelessly separated from the Germans; we have lost the use\nof a common language, and cannot talk with them if we would.\nWe cannot understand them; is it remotely possible that they will ever\nunderstand us? Here, too, the difficulties seem insuperable. It is true\nthat in the past they have shown themselves willing to study us and to\nimitate us. But unless they change their minds and their habits, it is\nnot easy to see how they are to get near enough to us to carry on their\nstudy. While they remain what they are we do not want them in our\nneighbourhood. We are not fighting to anglicize Germany, or to impose\nourselves on the Germans; our work is being done, as work is so often\ndone in this idle sport-loving country, with a view to a holiday. We\nwish to forget the Germans; and when once we have policed them into\nquiet and decency we shall have earned the right to forget them, at\nleast for a time. The time of our respite perhaps will not be long. If\nthe Allies defeat them, as the Allies will, it seems as certain as any\nuncertain thing can be that a mania for imitating British and American\ncivilization will take possession of Germany. We are not vindictive to a\nbeaten enemy, and when the Germans offer themselves as pupils we are not\nlikely to be either enthusiastic in our welcome or obstinate in our\nrefusal. We shall be bored but concessive. I confess that there are\nsome things in the prospect of this imitation which haunt me like a\nnightmare. The British soldier, whom the German knows to be second to\nnone, is distinguished for the levity and jocularity of his bearing in\nthe face of danger. What will happen when the German soldier attempts to\nimitate that? We shall be delivered from the German peril as when Israel\ncame out of Egypt, and the mountains skipped like rams.\nThe only parts of this book for which I claim any measure of authority\nare the parts which describe the English character. No one of purely\nEnglish descent has ever been known to describe the English character,\nor to attempt to describe it. The English newspapers are full of praises\nof almost any of the allied troops other than the English regiments. I\nhave more Scottish and Irish blood in my veins than English; and I think\nI can see the English character truly, from a little distance. If, by\nsome fantastic chance, the statesmen of Germany could learn what I tell\nthem, it would save their country from a vast loss of life and from many\nhopeless misadventures. The English character is not a removable part of\nthe British Empire; it is the foundation of the whole structure, and the\nsecret strength of the American Republic. But the statesmen of Germany,\nwho fall easy victims to anything foolish in the shape of a theory that\nflatters their vanity, would not believe a word of my essays even if\nthey were to read them, so they must learn to know the English character\nin the usual way, as King George the Third learned to know it from\nEnglishmen resident in America.\nA habit of lying and a belief in the utility of lying are often\nattended by the most unhappy and paralysing effects. The liars become\nunable to recognize the truth when it is presented to them. This is the\nmisery which fate has fixed on the German cause. War, the Germans are\nfond of remarking, is war. In almost all wars there is something to be\nsaid on both sides of the question. To know that one side or the other\nis right may be difficult; but it is always useful to know why your\nenemies are fighting. We know why Germany is fighting; she explained it\nvery fully, by her most authoritative voices, on the very eve of the\nstruggle, and she has repeated it many times since in moments of\nconfidence or inadvertence. But here is the tragedy of Germany: she does\nnot know why we are fighting. We have told her often enough, but she\ndoes not believe it, and treats our statement as an exercise in the\ncunning use of what she calls ethical propaganda. Why ethics, or morals,\nshould be good enough to inspire sympathy, but not good enough to\ninspire war, is one of the mysteries of German thought. No German, not\neven any of those few feeble German writers who have fitfully criticized\nthe German plan, has any conception of the deep, sincere, unselfish, and\nrighteous anger that was aroused in millions of hearts by the cruelties\nof the cowardly assault on Serbia and on Belgium. The late German\nChancellor became uneasily aware that the crucifixion of Belgium was one\nof the causes which made this war a truceless war, and his offer, which\nno doubt seemed to him perfectly reasonable, was that Germany is willing\nto bargain about Belgium, and to relax her hold, in exchange for solid\nadvantages elsewhere. Perhaps he knew that if the Allies were to spend\nfive minutes in bargaining about Belgium they would thereby condone the\nGerman crime and would lose all that they have fought for. But it seems\nmore likely that he did not know it. The Allies know it.\nThere is hope in these clear-cut issues. Of all wars that ever were\nfought this war is least likely to have an indecisive ending. It must be\nsettled one way or the other. If the Allied Governments were to make\npeace to-day, there would be no peace; the peoples of the free countries\nwould not suffer it. Germany cannot make peace, for she is bound by\nheavy promises to her people, and she cannot deliver the goods. She is\ntied to the stake, and must fight the course. Emaciated, exhausted,\nrepeating, as if in a bad dream, the old boastful appeals to military\nglory, she must go on till she drops, and then at last there will be\npeace.\nThese may themselves seem boastful words; they cannot be proved except\nby the event. There are some few Englishmen, with no stomach for a\nfight, who think that England is in a bad way because she is engaged in\na war of which the end is not demonstrably certain. If the issues of\nwars were known beforehand, and could be discounted, there would be no\nwars. Good wars are fought by nations who make their choice, and would\nrather die than lose what they are fighting for. Military fortunes are\nnotoriously variable, and depend on a hundred accidents. Moral causes\nare constant, and operate all the time. The chief of these moral causes\nis the character of a people. Germany, by her vaunted study of the art\nand science of war, has got herself into a position where no success can\ncome to her except by way of the collapse or failure of the\nEnglish-speaking peoples. A study of the moral causes, if she were\ncapable of making it, would not encourage her in her old impious belief\nthat God will destroy these peoples in order to clear the way for the\ndominion of the Hohenzollerns.\nMight Is Right\nFirst published as one of the Oxford Pamphlets, October 1914\nIt is now recognized in England that our enemy in this war is not a\ntyrant military caste, but the united people of modern Germany. We have\nto combat an armed doctrine which is virtually the creed of all Germany.\nSaxony and Bavaria, it is true, would never have invented the doctrine;\nbut they have accepted it from Prussia, and they believe it. The\nPrussian doctrine has paid the German people handsomely; it has given\nthem their place in the world. When it ceases to pay them, and not till\nthen, they will reconsider it. They will not think, till they are\ncompelled to think. When they find themselves face to face with a\ngreater and more enduring strength than their own, they will renounce\ntheir idol. But they are a brave people, a faithful people, and a stupid\npeople, so that they will need rough proofs. They cannot be driven from\ntheir position by a little paper shot. In their present mood, if they\nhear an appeal to pity, sensibility, and sympathy, they take it for a\ncry of weakness. I am reminded of what I once heard said by a genial and\nhumane Irish officer concerning a proposal to treat with the leaders of\na Zulu rebellion. ’Kill them all,’ he said, ’it’s the only thing they\nunderstand.’ He meant that the Zulu chiefs would mistake moderation for\na sign of fear. By the irony of human history this sentence has become\nalmost true of the great German people, who built up the structure of\nmodern metaphysics. They can be argued with only by those who have the\nwill and the power to punish them.\nThe doctrine that Might is Right, though it is true, is an unprofitable\ndoctrine, for it is true only in so broad and simple a sense that no one\nwould dream of denying it. If a single nation can conquer, depress, and\ndestroy all the other nations of the earth and acquire for itself a sole\ndominion, there may be matter for question whether God approves that\ndominion; what is certain is that He permits it. No earthly governor who\nis conscious of his power will waste time in listening to arguments\nconcerning what his power ought to be. His right to wield the sword can\nbe challenged only by the sword. An all-powerful governor who feared no\nassault would never trouble himself to assert that Might is Right. He\nwould smile and sit still. The doctrine, when it is propounded by weak\nhumanity, is never a statement of abstract truth; it is a declaration of\nintention, a threat, a boast, an advertisement. It has no value except\nwhen there is some one to be frightened. But it is a very dangerous\ndoctrine when it becomes the creed of a stupid people, for it flatters\ntheir self-sufficiency, and distracts their attention from the\ndifficult, subtle, frail, and wavering conditions of human power. The\ntragic question for Germany to-day is what she can do, not whether it is\nright for her to do it. The buffaloes, it must be allowed, had a\nperfect right to dominate the prairie of America, till the hunters came.\nThey moved in herds, they practised shock-tactics, they were violent,\nand very cunning. There are but few of them now. A nation of men who\nmistake violence for strength, and cunning for wisdom, may conceivably\nsuffer the fate of the buffaloes and perish without knowing why.\nTo the English mind the German political doctrine is so incredibly\nstupid that for many long years, while men in high authority in the\nGerman Empire, ministers, generals, and professors, expounded that\ndoctrine at great length and with perfect clearness, hardly any one\ncould be found in England to take it seriously, or to regard it as\nanything but the vapourings of a crazy sect. England knows better now;\nthe scream of the guns has awakened her. The German doctrine is to be\nput to the proof. Who dares to say what the result will be? To predict\ncertain failure to the German arms is only a kind of boasting. Yet there\nare guarded beliefs which a modest man is free to hold till they are\nseen to be groundless. The Germans have taken Antwerp; they may possibly\ndestroy the British fleet, overrun England and France, repel Russia,\nestablish themselves as the dictators of Europe–in short, fulfil their\ndreams. What then? At an immense cost of human suffering they will have\nachieved, as it seems to us, a colossal and agonizing failure. Their\nengines of destruction will never serve them to create anything so fair\nas the civilization of France. Their uneasy jealousy and self-assertion\nis a miserable substitute for the old laws of chivalry and regard for\nthe weak, which they have renounced and forgotten. The will and high\npermission of all-ruling Heaven may leave them at large for a time, to\nseek evil to others. When they have finished with it, the world will\nhave to be remade.\nWe cannot be sure that the Ruler of the world will forbid this. We\ncannot even be sure that the destroyers, in the peace that their\ndestruction will procure for them, may not themselves learn to rebuild.\nThe Goths, who destroyed the fabric of the Roman Empire, gave their\nname, in time, to the greatest mediaeval art. Nature, it is well known,\nloves the strong, and gives to them, and to them alone, the chance of\nbecoming civilized. Are the German people strong enough to earn that\nchance? That is what we are to see. They have some admirable elements of\nstrength, above any other European people. No other European army can be\nmarched, in close order, regiment after regiment, up the slope of a\nglacis, under the fire of machine guns, without flinching, to certain\ndeath. This corporate courage and corporate discipline is so great and\nimpressive a thing that it may well contain a promise for the future.\nMoreover, they are, within the circle of their own kin, affectionate and\ndutiful beyond the average of human society. If they succeed in their\nworldly ambitions, it will be a triumph of plain brute morality over all\nthe subtler movements of the mind and heart.\nOn the other hand, it is true to say that history shows no precedent for\nthe attainment of world-wide power by a people so politically stupid as\nthe German people are to-day. There is no mistake about this; the\ninstances of German stupidity are so numerous that they make something\nlike a complete history of German international relations. Here is one.\nAny time during the last twenty years it has been matter of common\nknowledge in England that one event, and one only, would make it\nimpossible for England to remain a spectator in a European war–that\nevent being the violation of the neutrality of Holland or Belgium. There\nwas never any secret about this, it was quite well known to many people\nwho took no special interest in foreign politics. Germany has maintained\nin this country, for many years, an army of spies and secret agents; yet\nnot one of them informed her of this important truth. Perhaps the\nradical difference between the German and the English political systems\nblinded the astute agents. In England nothing really important is a\nsecret, and the amount of privileged political information to be gleaned\nin barbers’ shops, even when they are patronized by Civil servants, is\ndistressingly small. Two hours of sympathetic conversation with an\nordinary Englishman would have told the German Chancellor more about\nEnglish politics than ever he heard in his life. For some reason or\nother he was unable to make use of this source of intelligence, so that\nhe remained in complete ignorance of what every one in England knew and\nsaid.\nHere is another instance. The programme of German ambition has been\nvoluminously published for the benefit of the world. France was first to\nbe crushed; then Russia; then, by means of the indemnities procured from\nthese conquests, after some years of recuperation and effort, the naval\npower of England was to be challenged and destroyed. This programme was\nset forth by high authorities, and was generally accepted; there was no\ncriticism, and no demur. The crime against the civilization of the world\nforeshadowed in the horrible words ’France is to be crushed’ is before a\nhigh tribunal; it would be idle to condemn it here. What happened is\nthis. The French and Russian part of the programme was put into action\nlast July. England, who had been told that her turn was not yet, that\nGermany would be ready for her in a matter of five or ten years, very\nnaturally refused to wait her turn. She crowded up on to the scaffold,\nwhich even now is in peril of breaking down under the weight of its\nvictims, and of burying the executioner in its ruins. But because\nEngland would not wait her turn, she is overwhelmed with accusations of\ntreachery and inhumanity by a sincerely indignant Germany. Could\nstupidity, the stupidity of the wise men of Gotham, be more fantastic or\nmore monstrous?\nGerman stupidity was even more monstrous. A part of the accusation\nagainst England is that she has raised her hand against the nation\nnearest to her in blood. The alleged close kinship of England and\nGermany is based on bad history and doubtful theory. The English are a\nmixed race, with enormous infusions of Celtic and Roman blood. The Roman\nsculpture gallery at Naples is full of English faces. If the German\nagents would turn their attention to hatters’ shops, and give the\nbarbers a rest, they would find that no English hat fits any German\nhead. But suppose we were cousins, or brothers even, what kind of\nargument is that on the lips of those who but a short time before were\nexplaining, with a good deal of zest and with absolute frankness, how\nthey intended to compass our ruin? There is something almost amiable in\nfatuity like this. A touch of the fool softens the brute.\nThe Germans have a magnificent war-machine which rolls on its way,\ncrushing all that it touches. We shall break it if we can. If we fail,\nthe German nation is at the beginning, not the end, of its troubles.\nWith the making of peace, even an armed peace, the war-machine has\nserved its turn; some other instrument of government must then be\ninvented. There is no trace of a design for this new instrument in any\nof the German shops. The governors of Alsace-Lorraine offer no\nsuggestions. The bald fact is that there is no spot in the world where\nthe Germans govern another race and are not hated. They know this, and\nare disquieted; they meet with coldness on all hands, and their remedy\nfor the coldness is self-assertion and brag. The Russian statesman was\nright who remarked that modern Germany has been too early admitted into\nthe comity of European nations. Her behaviour, in her new international\nrelations, is like the behaviour of an uneasy, jealous upstart in an\nold-fashioned quiet drawing-room. She has no genius for equality; her\nmanners are a compound of threatening and flattery. When she wishes to\nassert herself, she bullies; when she wishes to endear herself, she\ncrawls; and the one device is no more successful than the other.\nMight is Right; but the sort of might which enables one nation to govern\nanother in time of peace is very unlike the armoured thrust of the\nwar-engine. It is a power compounded of sympathy and justice. The\nEnglish (it is admitted by many foreign critics) have studied justice\nand desired justice. They have inquired into and protected rights that\nwere unfamiliar, and even grotesque, to their own ideas, because they\nbelieved them to be rights. In the matter of sympathy their reputation\ndoes not stand so high; they are chill in manner, and dislike all\neffusive demonstrations of feeling. Yet those who come to know them know\nthat they are not unimaginative; they have a genius for equality; and\nthey do try to put themselves in the other fellow’s place, to see how\nthe position looks from that side. What has happened in India may\nperhaps be taken to prove, among many other things, that the inhabitants\nof India begin to know that England has done her best, and does feel a\ndisinterested solicitude for the peoples under her charge. She has long\nbeen a mother of nations, and is not frightened by the problems of\nadolescence.\nThe Germans have as yet shown no sign of skill in governing other\npeoples. Might is Right; and it is quite conceivable that they may\nacquire colonies by violence. If they want to keep them they will have\nto shut their own professors’ books, and study the intimate history of\nthe British Empire. We are old hands at the business; we have lost more\ncolonies than ever they owned, and we begin to think that we have learnt\nthe secret of success. At any rate, our experience has done much for us,\nand has helped us to avoid failure. Yet the German colonial party stare\nat us with bovine malevolence. In all the library of German theorizing\nyou will look in vain for any explanation of the fact that the Boers\nare, in the main, loyal to the British Empire. If German political\nthinkers could understand that political situation, which seems to\nEnglish minds so simple, there might yet be hope for them. But they\nregard it all as a piece of black magic, and refuse to reason about it.\nHow should a herd of cattle be driven without goads? Witchcraft,\nwitchcraft!\nTheir world-wide experience it is, perhaps, which has made the English\nquick to appreciate the virtues of other peoples. I have never known an\nEnglishman who travelled in Russia without falling in love with the\nRussian people. I have never heard a German speak of the Russian people\nwithout contempt and dislike. Indeed the Germans are so unable to see\nany charm in that profound and humane people that they believe that the\nEnglish liking for them must be an insincere pretence, put forward for\nwicked or selfish reasons. What would they say if they saw a sight that\nis common in Indian towns, a British soldier and a Gurkha arm in arm,\nrolling down the street in cheerful brotherhood? And how is it that it\nhas never occurred to any of them that this sort of brotherhood has its\nvalue in Empire-building? The new German political doctrine has bidden\nfarewell to Christianity, but there are some political advantages in\nChristianity which should not be overlooked. It teaches human beings to\nthink of one another and to care for one another. It is an antidote to\nthe worst and most poisonous kind of political stupidity.\nAnother thing that the Germans will have to learn for the welfare of\ntheir much-talked Empire is the value of the lone man. The architects\nand builders of the British Empire were all lone men. Might is Right;\nbut when a young Englishman is set down at an outpost of Empire to\ngovern a warlike tribe, he has to do a good deal of hard thinking on the\nproblem of political power and its foundations. He has to trust to\nhimself, to form his own conclusions, and to choose his own line of\naction. He has to try to find out what is in the mind of others. A young\nGerman, inured to skilled slavery, does not shine in such a position.\nMan for man, in all that asks for initiative and self-dependence,\nEnglishmen are the better men, and some Germans know it. There is an old\njest that if you settle an Englishman and a German together in a new\ncountry, at the end of a year you will find the Englishman governor, and\nthe German his head clerk. A German must know the rules before he can\nget to work.\nMore than three hundred years ago a book was written in England which is\nin some ways a very exact counterpart to General von Bernhardi’s\nnotorious treatise. It is called Tamburlaine, and, unlike its\nsuccessor, is full of poetry and beauty. Our own colonization began with\na great deal of violent work, and much wrong done to others. We suffered\nfor our misdeeds, and we learned our lesson, in part at least. Why, it\nmay be asked, should not the Germans begin in the same manner, and by\ndegrees adapt themselves to the new task? Perhaps they may, but if they\ndo, they cannot claim the Elizabethans for their model. Of all men on\nearth the German is least like the undisciplined, exuberant Elizabethan\nadventurer. He is reluctant to go anywhere without a copy of the rules,\na guarantee of support, and a regular pension. His outlook is as prosaic\nas General von Bernhardi’s or General von der Golt’s own, and that is\nsaying a great deal. In all the German political treatises there is an\nimmeasurable dreariness. They lay down rules for life, and if they be\nasked what makes such a life worth living they are without any hint of\nan answer. Their world is a workhouse, tyrannically ordered, and full of\npusillanimous jealousies.\nIt is not impious to be hopeful. A Germanized world would be a\nnightmare. We have never attempted or desired to govern them, and we\nmust not think that God will so far forget them as to permit them to\nattempt to govern us. Now they hate us, but they do not know for how\nmany years the cheerful brutality of their political talk has shocked\nand disgusted us. I remember meeting, in one of the French Mediterranean\ndependencies, with a Prussian nobleman, a well-bred and pleasant man,\nwho was fond of expounding the Prussian creed. He was said to be a\npolitical agent of sorts, but he certainly learned nothing in\nconversation. He talked all the time, and propounded the most monstrous\nparadoxes with an air of mathematical precision. Now it was the\ncharacter of Sir Edward Grey, a cunning Machiavel, whose only aim was to\nset Europe by the ears and make neighbours fall out. A friend who was\nwith me, an American, laughed aloud at this, and protested, without\nproducing the smallest effect. The stream of talk went on. The error of\nthe Germans, we were told, was always that they are too humane; their\ndislike of cruelty amounts to a weakness in them. They let France escape\nwith a paltry fine, next time France must be beaten to the dust. Always\nwith a pleasant outward courtesy, he passed on to England. England was\ndecadent and powerless, her rule must pass to the Germans. ’But we shall\ntreat England rather less severely than France,’ said this bland apostle\nof Prussian culture, ’for we wish to make it possible for ourselves to\nremain in friendly relations with other English-speaking peoples.’ And\nso on–the whole of the Bernhardi doctrine, explained in quiet fashion\nby a man whose very debility of mind made his talk the more impressive,\nfor he was simply parroting what he had often heard. No one criticized\nhis proposals, nor did we dislike him. It all seemed too mad; a rather\nclumsy jest. His world of ideas did not touch our world at any point, so\nthat real talk between us was impossible. He came to see us several\ntimes, and always gave the same kind of mesmerized recital of Germany’s\npolicy. The grossness of the whole thing was in curious contrast with\nthe polite and quiet voice with which he uttered his insolences. When I\nremember his talk I find it easy to believe that the German Emperor and\nthe German Chancellor have also talked in such a manner that they have\nnever had the smallest opportunity of learning what Englishmen think and\nmean.\nWhile the German doctrine was the plaything merely of hysterical and\nsupersensitive persons, like Carlyle and Nietzsche, it mattered little\nto the world of politics. An excitable man, of vivid imagination and\ninvalid constitution, like Carlyle, feels a natural predilection for the\ncult of the healthy brute. Carlyle’s English style is itself a kind of\nepilepsy. Nietzsche was so nervously sensitive that everyday life was an\nanguish to him, and broke his strength. Both were poets, as Marlowe was\na poet, and both sang the song of Power. The brutes of the swamp and the\nfield, who gathered round them and listened, found nothing new or\nunfamiliar in the message of the poets. ’This’, they said, ’is what we\nhave always known, but we did not know that it is poetry. Now that great\npoets teach it, we need no longer be ashamed of it.’ So they went away\nresolved to be twice the brutes that they were before, and they named\nthemselves Culture-brutes.\nIt is difficult to see how the world, or any considerable part of it,\ncan belong to Germany, till she changes her mind. If she can do that,\nshe might make a good ruler, for she has solid virtues and good\ninstincts. It is her intellect that has gone wrong. Bishop Butler was\none day found pondering the problem whether, a whole nation can go mad.\nIf he had lived to-day what would he have said about it? Would he have\nadmitted that that strangest of grim fancies is realized?\nIt would be vain for Germany to take the world; she could not keep it;\nnor, though she can make a vast number of people miserable for a long\ntime, could she ever hope to make all the inhabitants of the world\nmiserable for all time. She has a giant’s power, and does not think it\ninfamous to use it like a giant. She can make a winter hideous, but she\ncannot prohibit the return of spring, or annul the cleansing power of\nwater. Sanity is not only better than insanity; it is much stronger, and\nMight is Right.\nMeantime, it is a delight and a consolation to Englishmen that England\nis herself again. She has a cause that it is good to fight for, whether\nit succeed or fail. The hope that uplifts her is the hope of a better\nworld, which our children shall see. She has wonderful friends. From\nwhat self-governing nations in the world can Germany hear such messages\nas came to England from the Dominions oversea? ’When England is at war,\nCanada is at war.’ ’To the last man and the last shilling, Australia\nwill support the cause of the Empire.’ These are simple words, and\nsufficient; having said them, Canada and Australia said no more. In the\ncompany of such friends, and for the creed that she holds, England might\nbe proud to die; but surely her time is not yet.\n  Our faith is ours, and comes not on a tide;\n  And whether Earth’s great offspring by decree\n  Must rot if they abjure rapacity,\n  Not argument, but effort shall decide.\n  They number many heads in that hard flock,\n  Trim swordsmen they push forth, yet try thy steel;\n  Thou, fighting for poor human kind, shalt feel\n  The strength of Roland in thy wrist to hew\n  A chasm sheer into the barrier rock,\n  And bring the army of the faithful through.\nThe War of Ideas\nAn Address to the Royal Colonial Institute, December 12, 1916\nI hold, as I daresay you do, that we are at a crisis of our history\nwhere there is not much room for talk. The time when this struggle might\nhave been averted or won by talk is long past. During the hundred years\nbefore the war we have not talked much, or listened much, to the\nGermans. For fifty of those years at least the head of waters that has\nnow been let loose in a devastating flood over Europe was steadily\naccumulating; but we paid little attention to it. People sometimes speak\nof the negotiations of the twelve days before the war as if the whole\nsecret and cause of the war could be found there; but it is not so.\nStatesmen, it is true, are the keepers of the lock-gates, but those\nkeepers can only delay, they cannot prevent an inundation that has great\nnatural causes. The world has in it evil enough, and darkness enough.\nBut it is not so bad and so dark that a slip in diplomacy, a careless\nword, or an impolite gesture, can instantaneously, as if by magic,\ninvolve twenty million men in a struggle to the death. It is only\nclever, conceited men, proud of their neat little minds, who think that\nbecause they cannot fathom the causes of the war, it might easily have\nbeen prevented. I confess I find it difficult to conceive of the war in\nterms of simple right and wrong. We must respect the tides, and their\nhuge unintelligible force teaches us to respect them.\nIt is not a war of race. For all our differences with the Germans, any\ncool and impartial mind must admit that we have many points of kinship\nwith them. During the years before the war our naval officers in the\nMediterranean found, I believe, that it was easier to associate on terms\nof social friendship with the Austrians than with the officers of any\nother foreign navy. We have a passionate admiration for France, and a\nreal devotion to her, but that is a love affair, not a family tie. We\nbegin to be experienced in love affairs, for Ireland steadily refuses to\nbe treated on any other footing. In any case, we are much closer to the\nGermans than they are to the Bulgarians or the Turks. Of these three we\nlike the Turks the best, because they are chivalrous and generous\nenemies, which the Germans are not.\nIt is a war of ideas. We are fighting an armed doctrine. Yet Burke’s use\nof those words to describe the military power of Revolutionary France\nshould warn us against fallacious attempts to simplify the issue. When\nideas become motives and are filtered into practice, they lose their\nclearness of outline and are often hard to recognize. They leaven the\nlump, but the lump is still human clay, with its passions and\nprejudices, its pride and its hate. I remember seeing in a provincial\npaper, in the early days of the war, two adjacent columns, both dealing\nwith the war. The first was headed ’A Holy War’ and set forth the great\nprinciples of nationality, respect for treaties, and protection of the\nweak, which in our opinion are the main motives of the Allies in this\nwar. The second was headed ’The War on Commerce; Tips to capture German\ntrade’, and set forth those other principles and motives which, in the\nopinion of the Germans, brought England into this war.\nI am not going to defend England against the charge that she entered\nthis war on a cold calculation of mercantile profit. Every one here\nknows that the charge is utterly untrue. Those who believe the charge\ncould not be shaken in their belief except by being educated all over\nagain, and introduced to some knowledge of human nature. It is enough to\nremark that this charge is a commonplace between belligerent nations.\nThey all like to believe that their adversaries entertain only base\nmotives, while they themselves act only on the loftiest ideal\npromptings. If the charge means only that every nation at war is bound\nto think of its own interests, to conserve its own strength, and to\nseize on all material gains that are within its reach, the charge is\ntrue and harmless. When two angry women quarrel in a back street, they\ncommonly accuse each other of being amorous. They might just as well\naccuse each other of being human. The charge is true and insignificant.\nSo also with nations; they all cherish themselves and seek to preserve\ntheir means of livelihood.\nIf this were their sole concern, there would be few wars; certainly this\nwar, which is desolating and impoverishing Europe, would be impossible.\nNo one, surely, can look at the war and say that nations are moved only\nby their material interests. It would be more plausible to say that they\nare too little moved by those interests. Bacon, in his essay Of Death,\nremarks that the fear of death does not much affect mankind. ’There is\nno passion in the mind of man so weak, but it mates and masters the\nfear of death; and therefore death is no such terrible enemy when a man\nhath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him.\nRevenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honour aspireth to it;\ngrief flieth to it, fear pre-occupateth it; nay, we read, after Otho the\nEmperor had slain himself, pity (which is the tenderest of affections)\nprovoked many to die out of mere compassion to their sovereign, and as\nthe truest sort of followers.’ If this is true of the fear of death, how\nmuch truer it is of the love of material gain. Any whim, or point of\npride, or fixed idea, or old habit, is enough to make a man or a nation\nforgo the hope of profit and fight for a creed.\nThe German creed is by this time well known. Before the war we took\nlittle notice of it. We sometimes saw it stated in print, but it seemed\nto us too monstrous and inhuman to be the creed of a whole people. We\nwere wrong; it was the creed of a whole people. By the mesmerism of\nState education, by the discipline of universal military service, by the\npride of the German people in their past victories, and by the fears\nnatural to a nation that finds enemies on all its fronts, an absolute\nbelief in the State, in war as the highest activity of the State, and in\nthe right of the State to enslave all its subjects, body and soul, to\nits purposes, had become the creed of all those diverse peoples that are\nunited under the Prussian Monarchy. Most of them are not naturally\nwarlike peoples. They have been lured, and frightened, and drilled, and\nbribed into war, but it is true to say that, on the whole, they enjoy\nfighting less than we do. One of the truest remarks ever made on the war\nwas that famous remark of a British private soldier, who was telling\nhow his company took a trench from the enemy. Fearing that his account\nof the affair might sound boastful, he added, ’You see, Sir, they’re not\na military people, like we are.’ Only the word was wrong, the meaning\nwas right. They are, as every one knows, an enormously military people,\nand, if they want to fight at all, they have to be a military people,\nfor the vast majority of them are not a warlike people. A first-class\narmy could never have been fashioned in Germany out of volunteer\ncivilians, like our army on the Somme. That army has a little shaken the\nfaith of the Germans in their creed. Again I must quote one of our\nsoldiers: ’I don’t say’, he remarked, ’that our average can run rings\nround their best; what I say is that our average is better than their\naverage, and our best is better than their best.’ The Germans already\nare uneasy about their creed and their system, but there is no escape\nfor them; they have sacrificed everything to it; they have impoverished\nthe mind and drilled the imagination of every German citizen, so that\nGermany appears before the world with the body of a giant and the mind\nof a dwarf; they have sacrificed themselves in millions that their creed\nmay prevail, and with their creed they must stand or fall. The State,\norganized as absolute power, responsible to no one, with no duties to\nits neighbour, and with only nominal duties to a strictly subordinate\nGod, has challenged the soul of man in its dearest possessions. We\ncannot predict the course of military operations; but if we were not\nsure of the ultimate issue of this great struggle, we should have no\nsufficient motive for continuing to breathe. The State has challenged\nthe soul of man before now, and has always been defeated. A miserable\nremnant of men and women, tied to stakes or starved in dungeons, have\nbefore now shattered what seemed an omnipotent tyranny, because they\nstood for the soul and were not prompted by vanity or self-regard. They\nhad great allies–\n     ’Their friends were exultations, agonies,\n     And love, and man’s unconquerable mind.’\nIf we are defeated we shall be defeated not by German strength but by\nour own weakness. The worst enemy of the martyr is doubt and the divided\nmind, which suggests the question, ’Is it, after all, worth while?’ We\nmust know what we have believed. What do we stand for in this war? It is\nonly the immovable conviction that we stand for something ultimate and\nessential that can help us and carry us through. No war of this kind and\non this scale is good enough to fight unless it is good enough to fail\nin. ’The calculation of profit’, said Burke,’in all such wars is false.\nOn balancing the account of such wars, ten thousand hogs-heads of sugar\nare purchased at ten thousand times their price. The blood of man should\nnever be shed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well shed for our\nfamily, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The\nrest is vanity; the rest is crime.’\nThe question I have asked is a difficult question to answer, or, rather,\nthe answer is not easy to formulate briefly and clearly. Most of the men\nat the front know quite well what they are fighting for; they know that\nit is for their country, but that it is also for their kind–for certain\nideals of humanity. We at home know that we are at war for liberty and\nhumanity. But these words are invoked by different nations in different\nsenses; the Germans, or at least most of them, have as much liberty as\nthey desire, and believe that the highest good of humanity is to be\nfound in the prevalence of their own ideas and of their own type of\ngovernment and society. No abstract demonstration can help us. Liberty\nis a highly comparative notion; no one asks for it complete. Humanity is\na highly variable notion; it is interpreted in different senses by\ndifferent societies. What we are confronted by is two types of\ncharacter, two sets of aims, two ideals for society. There can be no\nharm in trying to understand both.\nThe Germans can never be understood by those who neglect their history.\nThey are a solid, brave, and earnest people, who, till quite recent\ntimes, have been denied their share in the government of Europe. In the\nsixteenth century they were deeply stirred by questions of religion, and\nwere rent asunder by the Reformation. Compromise proved futile; the\nsmall German states were ranked on this side or on that at the will of\ntheir rulers and princes; men of the same race were ranged in mortal\nopposition on the question of religious belief, and there was no\nsolution but war. For thirty years in the seventeenth century the war\nraged. It was conducted with a fierceness and inhumanity that even the\npresent war has not equalled. The civilian population suffered\nhideously. Whole provinces were desolated and whole states were bereaved\nof their men. When, from mere exhaustion, the war came to an end,\nGermany lay prostrate, and the chief gains of the war fell to the rising\nmonarchy of France, which had intervened in the middle of the struggle.\nBy the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 Alsace and Lorraine went to France,\nand the rule of the great monarch, Louis XIV, had nothing to fear from\nthe German peoples. The ambitions of Germany, for long after this, were\nmainly cosmopolitan and intellectual. But political ambitions, though\nthey seemed almost dead, were revived by the hardy state of Prussia, and\nthe rest of Germany’s history, down to our own time, is the history of\nthe welding of the Germanic peoples into a single state by Prussian\nmonarchs and statesmen.\nThis history explains many things. If a people has a corporate memory,\nif it can learn from its own sufferings, Germany has reason enough to\ncherish with a passionate devotion her late achieved unity. And German\nbrutality, which is not the less brutality because Germans regard it as\nquite natural and right, has its origin in German history. The Prussian\nis a Spartan, a natural brute, but brutal to himself as well as to\nothers, capable of extremes of self-denial and self-discipline. From the\nPrussians the softer and more emotional German peoples of the South\nreceived the gift of national unity, and they repaid the debt by\nextravagant admiration for Prussian prowess and hardihood, which had\nbeen so serviceable to their cause. The Southern Germans, the Bavarians\nespecially, have developed a sort of sentimentalism of brutality,\nexpressed in the hysterical Hymn of Hate (which hails from Munich),\nexpressed also in those monstrous excesses and cruelties, surpassing\nanything that mere insensibility can produce, which have given the\nBavarian troops their foul reputation in the present war.\nThe last half century of German history must also be remembered. Three\nassaults on neighbouring states were rewarded by a great increase of\nterritory and of strength. From Denmark, in 1864, Prussia took\nSchleswig-Holstein. The defeat of Austria in 1866 brought Hanover and\nBavaria under the Prussian leadership; Alsace and Lorraine were regained\nfrom France in 1870. The Prussian mind, which is not remarkable for\nsubtlety, found a justification in these three wars for its favourite\ndoctrine of frightfulness. That doctrine, put briefly, is that people\ncan always be frightened into submission, and that it is cheaper to\nfrighten them than to fight them to the bitter end. Denmark was a small\nnation, and moreover was left utterly unsupported by the European powers\nwho had guaranteed her integrity. Bavaria was frightened, and will be\nfrightened again when her hot fit gives way to her cold fit. France was\ndivided and half-hearted under a tinsel emperor. It is Germany’s\nmisfortune that on these three special cases she based a general\ndoctrine of war. A very little knowledge of human nature–a knowledge so\nalien to her that she calls it psychology and assigns it to\nspecialists–would have taught her that, for the most part, human beings\nwhen they are fighting for their homes and their faith cannot be\nfrightened, and must be killed or conciliated. The practice of\nfrightfulness has not worked very well in this war. It has steeled the\nheart of Germany’s enemies. It has produced in her victims a temper of\nhate that will outlive this generation, and will make the small peoples\nwhom she has kicked and trampled on impossible subjects of the German\nEmpire. Worst of all it has suggested to onlookers that the people who\nhave so plenary a belief in frightfulness are not themselves strangers\nto fear. There is an old English proverb, hackneyed and stale three\nhundred years ago, but now freshened again by disuse, that the goodwife\nwould never have looked for her daughter in the oven unless she had been\nthere herself.\nHow shall I describe the English temper, which the Germans, high and\nlow, learned and ignorant, have so profoundly mistaken? You can get no\ndescription of it from the Englishman pure and simple; he has no theory\nof himself, and it bores him to hear himself described. Yet it is this\ntemper which has given England her great place in the world and which\nhas cemented the British Empire. It is to be found not in England alone,\nbut wherever there is a strain of English blood or an acceptance of\nEnglish institutions. You can find it in Australia, in Canada, in\nAmerica; it infects Scotland, and impresses Wales. It is everywhere in\nour trenches to-day. It is not clannish, or even national, it is\nessentially the lonely temper of a man independent to the verge of\nmelancholy. An admirable French writer of to-day has said that the best\nhandbook and guide to the English temper is Defoe’s romance of Robinson\nCrusoe. Crusoe is practical, but is conscious of the over-shadowing\npresence of the things that are greater than man. He makes his own\nclothing, teaches his goats to dance, and wrestles in thought with the\nproblems suggested by his Bible. Another example of the same temper may\nbe seen in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, and yet another in\nWordsworth’s Prelude. There is no danger that English thought will\never underestimate the value and meaning of the individual soul. The\ngreatest English literature, it might almost be said, from Shakespeare’s\nHamlet to Browning’s The Ring and the Book, is concerned with no\nother subject. The age-long satire against the English is that in\nEngland every man claims the right to go to heaven his own way. English\ninstitutions, instead of subduing men to a single pattern, are devised\nchiefly with the object of saving the rights of the subject and the\nliberty of the individual. ’Every man in his humour’ is an English\nproverb, and might almost be a statement of English constitutional\ndoctrine. But this extreme individualism is the right of all, and does\nnot favour self-exaltation. The English temper has an almost morbid\ndislike of all that is showy or dramatic in expression. I remember how a\nWinchester boy, when he was reproached with the fact that Winchester has\nproduced hardly any great men, replied, ’No, indeed, I should think not.\nWe would pretty soon have knocked that out of them.’ And the epigrams of\nthe English temper usually take the form of understatement. ’Give\nDayrolles a chair’ were the last dying words of Lord Chesterfield,\nspoken of the friend who had come to see him. When the French troops go\nover the parapet to make an advance, their battle cry shouts the praises\nof their Country. The British troops prefer to celebrate the advance in\na more trivial fashion, ’This way to the early door, sixpence extra.’\nI might go on interminably with this dissertation, but I have said\nenough for my purpose. The history of England has had much to do with\nmoulding the English temper. We have been protected from direct\nexposure to the storms that have swept the Continent. Our wars on land\nhave been adventures undertaken by expeditionary forces. At sea, while\nthe power of England was growing, we have been explorers, pirates,\nbuccaneers. Now that we are involved in a great European war on land,\nour methods have been changed. The artillery and infantry of a modern\narmy cannot act effectively on their own impulse. We hold the sea, and\nthe pirates’ work for the present has passed into other hands. But our\nspirit and temper is the same as of old. It has found a new world in the\nair. War in the air, under the conditions of to-day, demands all the old\ngallantry and initiative. The airman depends on his own brain and nerve;\nhe cannot fall back on orders from his superiors. Our airmen of to-day\nare the true inheritors of Drake; they have the same inspired\nrecklessness, the same coolness, and the same chivalry to a vanquished\nenemy.\nI am a very bad example of the English temper; for the English temper\ngrumbles at all this, to the great relief of our enemies, who believe\nthat what a man admits against his own nation must be true. Our\npessimists, by indulging their natural vein, serve us, without reward,\nquite as well as Germany is served by her wireless press. They deceive\nthe enemy.\nModern Germany has organized and regimented her people like an ant-hill\nor a beehive. The people themselves, including many who belong to the\nupper class, are often simple villagers in temper, full of kindness and\nanger, much subject to envy and jealousy, not magnanimous, docile and\nobedient to a fault. If they claimed, as individuals, to represent the\nhighest reach of European civilization, the claim would be merely\nabsurd. So they shift their ground, and pretend that society is greater\nthan man, and that by their painstaking organization their society has\nbeen raised to the pinnacle of human greatness. They make this claim so\ninsistently, and in such obvious good faith, that some few weak tempers\nand foolish minds in England have been impressed by it. These\npanic-stricken counsellors advise us, without delay, to reform our\ninstitutions and organize them upon the German model. Only thus, they\ntell us, can we hold our own against so huge a power. But if we were to\ntake their advice, we should have nothing of our own left to hold. It is\nreasonable and good to co-operate and organize in order to attain an\nagreed object, but German organization goes far beyond this. The German\nnation is a carefully built, smooth-running machine, with powerful\nengines. It has only one fault–that any fool can drive it; and seeing\nthat the governing class in Germany is obstinate and unimaginative,\nthere is no lack of drivers to pilot it to disaster. The best ability of\nGermany is seen in her military organization. Napoleon is her worshipped\nmodel, and, like many admirers of Napoleon, she thinks only of his great\ncampaigns; she forgets that he died in St. Helena, and that his schemes\nfor the reorganization of Europe failed.\nI know that many people in England are not daunted but depressed by the\nmilitary successes of the enemy. Our soldiers in the field are not\ndepressed. But we who are kept at home suffer from the miasma of the\nback-parlour. We read the headlines of newspapers–a form of literature\nthat is exciting enough, but does not merit the praise given to\nSophocles, who saw life steadily and saw it whole. We keep our ears to\nthe telephone, and we forget that the great causes which are always at\nwork, and which will shape the issues of this war, are not recorded upon\nthe telephone. There are things truer and more important than the latest\ndispatches. Here is one of them. The organization of the second-rate can\nnever produce anything first-rate. We do not understand a people who,\nwhen it comes to the last push of man against man, throw up their hands\nand utter the pathetic cry of ’Kamerad’. To surrender is a weakness that\nno one who has not been under modern artillery fire has any right to\ncondemn; to profess a sudden affection for the advancing enemy is not\nweakness but baseness. Or rather, it would be baseness in a voluntary\nsoldier; in the Germans it means only that the war is not their own war;\nthat they are fighting as slaves, not as free men. The idea that we\ncould ever live under the rule of these people is merely comic. To do\nthem justice, they do not now entertain the idea, though they have\ndallied with it in the past.\nNo harm can be done, I think, by preaching to the English people the\nnecessity for organization and discipline. We shall still be ourselves,\nand there is no danger that we shall overdo discipline or make\norganization a thing to be worshipped for its own sake. The danger is\nall the other way. We have learnt much from the war, and the work that\nwe shall have to do when it ends is almost more important than the terms\nof peace, or concessions made this way and that. If the treacherous\nassault of the Germans on the liberties and peace of Europe is rewarded\nby any solid gain to the German Empire, then history may forgive them,\nbut this people of the British Empire will not forgive them. Nothing\nwill be as it was before; and our cause, which will not be lost in the\nwar, will still have to be won in the so-called peace. I know that some\nsay, ’Let us have war when we are at war, and peace when we are at\npeace’. It sounds plausible and magnanimous, but it is Utopian. You must\nreckon with your own people. They know that when we last had peace, the\nsunshine of that peace was used by the Germans to hatch the spawn of\nmalice and treason. If the Germans are defeated in the war, we shall, I\nsuppose, forgive them, for the very English reason that it is a bore not\nto forgive your enemies. But if they escape without decisive defeat in\nbattle, their harder trial is yet to come.\nIn some ways we are stronger than we have been in all our long history.\nWe have found ourselves, and we have found our friends. Our dead have\ntaught the children of to-day more and better than any living teachers\ncan teach them. No one in this country will ever forget how the people\nof the Dominions, at the first note of war, sprang to arms like one man.\nWe must not thank or praise them; like the Navy, they regard our thanks\nand praise as something of an impertinence. They are not fighting, they\nsay, for us. But that is how we discovered them. They are doing much\nbetter than fighting for us, they are fighting with us, because, without\na word of explanation or appeal, their ideas and ours are the same. We\nnever have discussed with them, and we never shall discuss, what is\ndecent and clean and honourable in human behaviour. A philosopher who\nis interested in this question can find plenty of intellectual exercise\nby discussing it with the Germans, Where an Englishman, a Canadian, and\nan Australian are met, there is no material for such a debate.\nIt would be extravagant to suppose that a discovery like this can leave\nour future relations untouched. We now know that we are profoundly\nunited in a union much stronger and deeper than any mechanism can\nproduce. I know how difficult a problem it is to hit on the best device\nfor giving political expression to this union between States separated\nfrom one another by the whole world’s diameter, differing in their\ncircumstances, their needs, and their outlook. I do not dare to\nprescribe; but I should like to make a few remarks, and to call\nattention to a few points which are perhaps more present to the mind of\nthe ordinary citizen than they are in the discussions of constitutional\nexperts.\nWe must arrange for co-operation and mutual support. If the arrangement\nis complicated and lengthy, we must not wait for it; we must meet and\ndiscuss our common affairs. Ministers from the Dominions have already\nsat with the British Cabinet. We can never go back on that; it is a\nlandmark in our history. Our Ministers must travel; if their supporters\nare impatient of their absence on the affairs of the Empire, they must\nfind some less parochial set of supporters. We have begun in the right\nway; the right way is not to pass laws determining what you are to do;\nbut to do what is needful, and do it at once,–do a lot of things, and\nregularize your successes by later legislation. Now is the time, while\nthe Empire is white-hot. Our first need is not lawyers, but men who,\nfeeling friendly, know how to behave as friends do. They will not be\nimpeached if they go beyond the letter of the law. One act of faith is\nworth a hundred arguments. This is a family affair; the habits of an\naffectionate and united family are the only good model.\nAs for the Crown Colonies and India, the Dominions must share our\nburden. It is objected, both here and in India, that life in the\nDominions is a very inadequate education for the sympathetic handling of\nalien races and customs. So is life in many parts of this island. The\nfact is that the process of learning to govern these alien peoples is\nthe best education in the world. The Indian Civil Service is a great\nCollege, and it governs India. I can speak to this point, for I have\nlived there and seen it at work. If India were really governed by the\nideas of the young novices who go out there fresh from their\nexaminations, she would be a distressful country. But the novice is\ntaken in hand at once by the older members of the service; he works\nunder the eye of the Collector and the Assistant Collector; they\nshoulder him and instruct him as tame elephants shoulder and instruct\nthe wild; they are kind to him, and he lives in their company while his\nprejudices and follies peel off him; so that within a few years he\nbecomes a tolerant, wise, and devoted civil servant, who speaks the\nlanguage of the College and is proud to belong to it. The success of the\nGovernment of India is not to be credited to the classes from which the\nCivil Service is recruited, but to the discipline of the Service itself,\na Service so high in tradition and so free from corruption that\nadvancement in it is to be gained only by intelligence and sympathy.\nWhat I am saying is that I can imagine no finer raw material for the\npolitical discipline of the Indian Civil Service than some of the\ngenerous and clean-run spirits who have come from the Dominions to help\nin this war. They could be introduced to a share of our responsibilities\nwithout impeding or retarding the movement to give to selected natives\nof India a larger share in the government of their country.\nBut the war is not over, so I return to the main issue–the conflict\nbetween the English idea and the German idea of world government. It is\nnot an accident, as Baron von Hügel remarks in his book on The German\nSoul, that the chief colonizing nation of the world should be a nation\nwithout a national army. We have depended enormously in the past on the\ninitiative and virtue of the individual adventurer; if our adventurers\nwere to fail us, which is not likely, or if the State were to supersede\nthem, and attempt to do their work, which is not conceivable, our\npolitical power and influence would vanish with them. The world might\nperhaps be well ordered, but there would be no freedom, and no fun. The\nbeauty of the adventurer is that he is practically invincible. He does\nnot wait for orders. Under the most perfect police system that Germany\ncould devise, he would be up and at it again. We are not so numerous as\nthe Germans, but there are enough and to spare of us to make German\ngovernment impossible in any place where we pitch our tents. We are\npractised hands at upsetting governments. Our political system is a\ntraining school for rebels. This is what makes our very existence an\noffence to the moral instincts of the German people. They are quite\nright to want to kill us; the only way to abolish fun and freedom is to\nabolish life. But I must not be unjust to them; their forethought\nprovides for everything, and no doubt they would prescribe authorized\nforms of fun for half an hour a week, and would gather together their\nsubjects in public assembly, under municipal regulations, to perform\napproved exercises in freedom.\nMankind lives by ideas; and if an irreconcilable difference in ideas\nmakes a good war, then this is a good war. The contrast between the two\nideas is profound and far-reaching. My business lies in a University.\nFor a good many years before the war certain selected German students,\nwho had had a University education in their own country, came as Rhodes\nscholars to Oxford. The intention of Mr. Rhodes was benevolent; he\nthought that if German students were to reside for four years at Oxford\nand to associate there, at an impressionable time of life, with young\nEnglishmen, understanding and fellowship would be encouraged between the\ntwo peoples. But the German government took care to defeat Mr. Rhodes’s\nintention. Instead of sending a small number of students for the full\nperiod, as Mr. Rhodes had provided, Germany asked and (by whose mistake\nI do not know) obtained leave to send a larger number for a shorter\nstay. The students selected were intended for the political and\ndiplomatic service, and were older than the usual run of Oxford\nfreshmen. Their behaviour had a certain ambassadorial flavour about it.\nThey did not mix much in the many undergraduate societies which flourish\nin a college, but met together in clubs of their own to drink patriotic\ntoasts. They were nothing if not superior. I remember a conversation I\nhad with one of them who came to consult me. He wished, he said, to do\nsome definite piece of research work in English literature. I asked him\nwhat problems or questions in English literature most interested him,\nand he replied that he would do anything that I advised. We had a talk\nof some length, wholly at cross-purposes. At last I tried to make my\npoint of view clear by reminding him that research means finding the\nanswer to a question, and that if his reading of English literature,\nwhich had been fairly extensive, had suggested no questions to his mind,\nhe was not in the happiest possible position to begin research. This\ntouched his national pride, and he gave me something not unlike a\nlecture. In Germany, he said, the professor tells you what you are to\ndo; he gives you a subject for investigation, he names the books you are\nto read, and advises you on what you are to write; you follow his\nadvice, and produce a thesis, which gains you the degree of Doctor of\nLetters. I have seen a good many of these theses, and I am sure this\naccount is correct. With very rare exceptions they are as dead as\nmutton, and much less nourishing. The upshot of our conversation was\nthat he thought me an incompetent professor, and I thought him an\nunprofitable student.\nThere are many people in England to-day who praise the thoroughness of\nthe Germans, and their devotion to systematic thought. Has any one ever\ntaken the trouble to trace the development of the thesis habit, and its\ninfluence on their national life? They theorize everything, and they\nbelieve in their theories. They have solemn theories of the English\ncharacter, of the French character, of the nature of war, of the history\nof the world. No breath of scepticism dims their complacency, although\nevents steadily prove their theories wrong. They have courage, and when\nthey are seeking truth by the process of reasoning, they accept the\nconclusions attained by the process, however monstrous these conclusions\nmay be. They not only accept them, they act upon them, and, as every one\nknows, their behaviour in Belgium was dictated to them by their\nphilosophy.\nThought of this kind is the enemy of the human race. It intoxicates\nsluggish minds, to whom thought is not natural. It suppresses all the\ngentler instincts of the heart and supplies a basis of orthodoxy for all\nthe cruelty and treachery in the world. I do not know, none of us knows,\nwhen or how this war will end. But I know that it is worth fighting to\nthe end, whatever it may cost to all and each of us. We may have peace\nwith the Germans, the peace of exhaustion or the peace that is only a\nbreathing space in a long struggle. We can never have peace with the\nGerman idea. It was not the idea of the older German thinkers–of Kant,\nor of Goethe, who were good Europeans. Kant said that there is nothing\ngood in the world except the good will. The modern German doctrine is\nthat there is nothing good in the world except what tends to the power\nand glory of the State. The inventor of this doctrine, it may be\nremembered, was the Devil, who offered to the Son of Man the glory of\nall the kingdoms of the world, if only He would fall down and worship\nhim. The Germans, exposed to a like temptation, have accepted the offer\nand have fulfilled the condition. They can have no assurance that faith\nwill be kept with them. On the other hand, we can have no assurance that\nthey will suffer any signal or dramatic reverse. Human history does not\nusually observe the laws of melodrama. But we know that their newly\npurchased doctrine can be fought, in war and in peace, and we know that\nin the end it will not prevail.\nThe Faith of England\nAn Address to the Union Society of University College, London, March\n22,1917\nWhen Professor W.P. Ker asked me to address you on this ceremonial\noccasion I felt none of the confidence of the man who knows what he\nwants to say, and is looking for an audience. But Professor Ker is my\nold friend, and this place is the place where I picked up many of those\nfragmentary impressions which I suppose must be called my education. So\nI thought it would be ungrateful to refuse, even though it should prove\nthat I have nothing to express save goodwill and the affections of\nmemory.\nWhen I matriculated in the University of London and became a student in\nthis place, my professors were Professor Goodwin, Professor Church,\nProfessor Henrici, Professor Groom Robertson, and Professor Henry\nMorley. I remember all these, though, if they were alive, I do not think\nthat any of them would remember me. The indescribable exhilaration,\nwhich must be familiar to many of you, of leaving school and entering\ncollege, is in great part the exhilaration of making acquaintance with\nteachers who care much about their subject and little or nothing about\ntheir pupils. To escape from the eternal personal judgements which make\na school a place of torment is to walk upon air. The schoolmaster looks\nat you; the college professor looks the way you are looking. The\nstatements made by Euclid, that thoughtful Greek, are no longer\nencumbered at college with all those preposterous and irrelevant moral\nconsiderations which desolate the atmosphere of a school. The question\nnow is not whether you have perfectly acquainted yourself with what\nEuclid said, but whether what he said is true. In my earliest days at\ncollege I heard a complete exposition of the first six books of Euclid,\ngiven in four lectures, with masterly ease and freedom, by Professor\nHenrici, who did not hesitate to employ methods of demonstration which,\nthough they are perfectly legitimate and convincing, were rejected by\nthe daintiness of the Greek. Professor Groom Robertson introduced his\npupils to the mysteries of mental and moral philosophy, and incidentally\ndisaffected some of us by what seemed to us his excessive reverence for\nthe works of Alexander Bain. Those works were our favourite theme for\nsatirical verse, which we did not pain our Professor by publishing.\nProfessor Henry Morley lectured hour after hour to successive classes in\na room half way down the passage, on the left. Even overwork could not\ndeaden his enormous vitality; but I hope that his immediate successor\ndoes not lecture so often. Outside the classrooms I remember the\npassages, which resembled the cellars of an unsuccessful sculptor, the\nlibrary, where I first read Romeo and Juliet, and the refectory, where\nwe discussed human life in most, if not in all, of its aspects. In the\nneighbourhood of the College there was the classic severity of Gower\nStreet, and, for those who preferred the richer variety of romance,\nthere was always the Tottenham Court Road. Beyond all, and throughout\nall, there was friendship, and there was freedom. The College was\nfounded, I believe, partly in the interests of those who object to\nsubscribe to a conclusion before they are permitted to examine the\ngrounds for it. It has always been a free place; and if I remember it as\na place of delight, that is because I found here the delights of\nfreedom.\nMy thoughts in these days are never very long away from the War, so that\nI should feel it difficult to speak of anything else. Yet there are so\nmany ways in which it would be unprofitable for me to pretend to speak\nof it, that the difficulty remains. I have no knowledge of military or\nnaval strategy. I am not intimately acquainted with Germany or with\nGerman culture. I could praise our own people, and our own fighting men,\nfrom a full heart; but that, I think, is not exactly what you want from\nme. So I am reduced to attempting what we have all had to attempt during\nthe past two years or more, to try to state, for myself as much as for\nyou, the meaning of this War so far as we can perceive it.\nIt seems to be a decree of fate that this country shall be compelled\nevery hundred years to fight for her very life. We live in an island\nthat lies across the mouths of the Rhine, and guards the access to all\nthe ports of northern Europe. In this island we have had enough safety\nand enough leisure to develop for ourselves a system of constitutional\nand individual liberty which has had an enormous influence on other\nnations. It has been admired and imitated; it has also been hated and\nattacked. To the majority of European statesmen and politicians it has\nbeen merely unintelligible. Some of them have regarded it with a kind\nof superstitious reverence; for we have been very successful in the\nworld at large, and how could so foolish and ineffective a system\nachieve success except by adventitious aid? Others, including all the\nstatesmen and political theorists who prepared Germany for this War,\nhave refused to admire; the power of England, they have taught, is not\nreal power; she has been crafty and lucky; she has kept herself free\nfrom the entanglements and strifes of the Continent, and has enriched\nherself by filching the property of the combatants. If once she were\ncompelled to hold by force what she won by guile, her pretensions would\ncollapse, and she would fall back into her natural position as a small\nagricultural island, inhabited by a people whose proudest boast would\nthen be that they are poor cousins of the Germans.\nIt is difficult to discuss this question with German professors and\npoliticians: they have such simple minds, and they talk like angry\nchildren. Their opinions concerning England are not original; their\nviews were held with equal fervour and expressed in very similar\nlanguage by Philip of Spain in the sixteenth century, by Louis XIV of\nFrance in the seventeenth century, and by Napoleon at the close of the\neighteenth century. ’These all died in faith, not having received the\npromises, but having seen them afar off.’ I will ask you to consider the\nattack made upon England by each of these three powerful rulers.\nAny one who reads the history of these three great wars will feel a\nsense of illusion, as if he were reading the history of to-day. The\npoints of resemblance in all four wars are so many and so great that it\nseems as if the four wars were all one war, repeated every century. The\ncause of the war is always an ambitious ruler who covets supremacy on\nthe European Continent. England is always opposed to him–inevitably and\ninstinctively. It took the Germans twenty years to prepare their people\nfor this War. It took us two days to prepare ours. Our instinct is quick\nand sound; for the resources and wealth of the Continent, if once they\nwere controlled by a single autocratic power, would make it impossible\nfor England to follow her fortunes upon the sea. But we never stand\nquite alone. The smaller peoples of the Continent, who desire\nself-government, or have achieved it, always give the conqueror trouble,\nand rebel against him or resist him. England always sends help to them,\nthe help of an expeditionary force, or, failing that, the help of\nirregular volunteers. Sir Philip Sidney dies at Zutphen; Sir John Moore\nat Corunna. There is always desperate fighting in the Low Countries; and\nthe names of Mons, Liège, Namur, and Lille recur again and again.\nEngland always succeeds in maintaining herself, though not without some\nreverses, on the sea. In the end the power of the master of legions,\nPhilip, Louis, Napoleon, and shall we say William, crumbles and melts;\nhis ambitions are too costly to endure, his people chafe under his lash,\nand his kingdom falls into insignificance or is transformed by internal\nrevolution.\nIn all these wars there is one other resemblance which it is good to\nremember to-day. The position of England, at one time or another in the\ncourse of the war, always seems desperate. When Philip of Spain invaded\nEngland with the greatest navy of the world, he was met on the seas by a\nfleet made up chiefly of volunteers. When Louis overshadowed Europe and\nthreatened England, our king was in his pay and had made a secret treaty\nwith him; our statesmen, moreover, had destroyed our alliance with the\nmaritime powers of Sweden and Holland, we had war with the Dutch, and\nour fleet was beaten by them. During the war against Napoleon we were in\nan even worse plight; the plausible political doctrines of the\nRevolution found many sympathizers in this country; our sailors mutinied\nat the Nore; Ireland was aflame with discontent; and we were involved in\nthe Mahratta War in India, not to mention the naval war with America.\nEven after Trafalgar, our European allies failed us, Napoleon disposed\nof Austria and Prussia, and concluded a separate treaty with Russia. It\nwas then that Wordsworth wrote–\n  ’’Tis well! from this day forward we shall know\n  That in ourselves our safety must be sought;\n  That by our own right hands it must be wrought;\n  That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.\n  O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!\n  We shall exult, if they who rule the land\n  Be men who hold its many blessings dear,\n  Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,\n  Who are to judge of dangers which they fear,\n  And honour which they do not understand.’\nAlways in the same cause, we have suffered worse things than we are\nsuffering to-day, and if there is worse to come we hope that we are\nready. The youngest and best of us, who carry on and go through with\nit, though many of them are dead and many more will not live to see the\nday of victory, have been easily the happiest and most confident among\nus. They have believed that, at a price, they can save decency and\ncivilization in Europe, and, if they are wrong, they have known, as we\nknow, that the day when decency and civilization are trampled under the\nfoot of the brute is a day when it is good to die.\nWhen I speak of the German nation as the brute I am not speaking\ncontroversially or rhetorically; the whole German nation has given its\nhearty assent to a brutal doctrine of war and politics; no facts need be\ndisputed between us: what to us is their shame, to them is their glory.\nThis is a grave difference; yet it would be wrong to suppose that we can\ntreat it adequately by condemning the whole German nation as a nation of\nconfessed criminals. It is the paradox of war that there is always right\non both sides. When a man is ready and willing to sacrifice his life,\nyou cannot deny him the right to choose what he will die for. The most\nbeautiful virtues, faith and courage and devotion, grow like weeds upon\nthe battle-field. The fighters recognize these virtues in each other,\nand the front lines, for all their mud and slaughter, are breathed on by\nthe airs of heaven. Hate and pusillanimity have little there to nourish\nthem. To find the meaner passions you must seek further back. Johnson,\nspeaking in the Idler of the calamities produced by war, admits that\nhe does not know ’whether more is to be dreaded from streets filled with\nsoldiers accustomed to plunder, or from garrets filled with scribblers\naccustomed to lie’. Now that our army is the nation in arms, the danger\nfrom a lawless soldiery has become less, or has vanished; but the other\ndanger has increased. Journalists are not the only offenders. It is a\nstrange, squalid background for the nobility of the soldier that is made\nby the deceits and boasts of diplomatists and statesmen. In one of the\nprison camps of England, some weeks ago, I saw a Saxon boy who had\nfought bravely for his country. Simplicity and openness and loyalty were\nwritten on his face. There are hundreds like him, and I would not\nmention him if it were not that that same day I read with a new and\nheightened sense of disgust a speech by the German Chancellor, writhing\nwith timidity and dishonesty and uneasy braggadocio. Those who feel this\ncontrast as I did may be excused, I think, if they come to the\nconclusion that to talk about war is an accursed trade, and that to\nfight well, whether on the one side or the other, is the only noble\npart.\nYet there is no escape for us; if we are to avoid chaos, if the daily\nlife of the world is to be re-established and carried on, there must be\nan understanding between nations, and there is no possible way to come\nto an understanding save by the action and words of representative men\non the one side and the other. Such representative men there are; there\nis no reason to doubt that they do in the main truly express the\naspirations and wishes of their people, and on both sides they have\neither explicitly or virtually made offers. The offer of the Allied\nPowers is on record. What does Germany offer? She has refused to make a\ndefinite statement, but her rulers have talked a great deal, and what\nshe intends is not really in doubt; only she is not sure whether she can\nget it, and still clings to the hope that a favourable turn of events\nmay relieve her of the duty of making proposals, and put her in a\nposition to dictate a settlement. We all know what that settlement would\nbe.\nThe German offer for a solution of the problem of world-government is\nGerman sentiments, German racial pride, German manners and customs, an\nimmense increase of German territory and German influence, and above all\nan acknowledged supremacy for the German race among the nations of the\nworld. She thinks she has not stated these aims in so many words; but\nshe has. When it was suggested that the future peace of the world might\nbe assured by the formation of a League to Enforce Peace, Germany,\nthrough her official spokesmen, expressed her sympathy with that idea,\nand stated that she would very gladly put herself at the head of such a\nLeague. I can hardly help loving the Germans when their rustic\nsimplicity and rustic cunning lead them all unconsciously into\nself-revelation. The very idea of a League to Enforce Peace implies\nequality among the contracting parties; and Germany does not understand\nequality. ’By all means’, she says,’let us sit at a round table, and I\nwill sit at the top of it.’ Her panacea for human ills is Germanism. She\nhas nothing to offer but a purely national sentiment, which some,\ngreatly privileged, may share, and the rest must revere and bow to. In\nthe Book of Genesis we are told how Joseph was thrown into a pit by his\nelder brothers for talking just like this; but he meant it quite\ninnocently, and so do the Germans. They do not intend irreverence to God\nwhen they call Him the good German God. On the contrary, they choose for\nHis praise a word that to them stands for all goodness and all\ngreatness. Their worship expresses itself naturally in the tribal ritual\nand the tribal creed. This tribal creed, there can be no doubt, is what\nthey offer us for a talisman to ensure the right ordering of the world.\nPatriotism and loyalty to hearth and home are passions so strong in\nhumanity that a creed like this, when men are under its influence, is\nnot easily seen to be absurd. The Saxon boy, whom I saw in his prison\ncamp, probably would not quarrel with it. And even in the wider world of\nthought the illusions of nationalism are all-pervading. I once heard\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick remark that it is not easy for us to understand\nhow the troops of Portugal are stirred to heroic effort when their\ncommanders call on them to remember that they are Portuguese. He would\nno doubt have been the first to admit, for he had an alert and sceptical\nmind, that it is only our stupidity which finds anything comic in such\nan appeal. But it is stupidity of this kind which unfits men to deal\nwith other races, and it is stupidity of this kind which has been\nexalted by the Germans as a primal duty, and has, indeed, been advanced\nby them as their principal claim to undertake the government of the\nworld.\nThis extreme nationalism, this unwillingness to feel any sympathy for\nother peoples, or to show them any consideration, has stupefied and\nblinded the Germans. One of the heaviest charges that can be brought\nagainst them is that they have seen no virtue in France, I do not ask\nthat they shall interrupt the War to express admiration for their\nenemies: I am speaking of the time before the War. France is the chief\nmodern inheritor of that great Roman civilization which found us painted\nsavages, and made us into citizens of the world. The French mind, it is\nadmitted, and admitted most readily by the most intelligent men, is\nquick and delicate and perceptive, surer and clearer in its operation\nthan the average European mind. Yet the Germans, infatuated with a\nbelief in their own numbers and their own brute strength, have dared to\nexpress contempt for the genius of France. A contempt for foreigners is\ncommon enough among the vulgar and unthinking of all nations, but I do\nnot believe that you will find anywhere but in Germany a large number of\nmen trained in the learned professions who are so besotted by vanity as\nto deny to France her place in the vanguard of civilization. These louts\ncannot be informed or argued with; they are interested in no one but\nthemselves, and naked self-assertion is their only idea of political\nargument. Treitschke, who was for twenty years Professor of History at\nBerlin, and who did perhaps more than any other man to build up the\nmodern German creed, has crystallized German politics in a single\nsentence. ’War’, he says, ’is politics par excellence,’ that is to\nsay, politics at their purest and highest. Our political doctrine, if it\nmust be put in as brief a form, would be better expressed in the\nsentence, ’War is the failure of politics’.\nIf England were given over to nationalism as Germany is given over,\nthen a war between these two Powers, though it would still be a great\ndramatic spectacle, would have as little meaning as a duel between two\nrival gamebirds in a cockpit. We know, and it will some day dawn on the\nGermans, that this War has a deeper meaning than that. We are not\nnationalist; we are too deeply experienced in politics to stumble into\nthat trap. We have had a better and longer political education than has\ncome to Germany in her short and feverish national life. It is often\nsaid that the Germans are better educated than we are, and in a sense\nthat is true; they are better furnished with schools and colleges and\nthe public means of education. The best boy in a school is the boy who\nbest minds his book, and even if he dutifully believes all that it tells\nhim, that will not lose him the prize. When he leaves school and\ngraduates in a wider world, where men must depend on their own judgement\nand their own energy, he is often a little disconcerted to find that\nsome of his less bookish fellows easily outgo him in quickness of\nunderstanding and resource. German education is too elaborate; it\nattempts to do for its pupils much that they had better be left to do\nfor themselves. The pupils are docile and obedient, not troubled with\nunruly doubts and questionings, so that the German system of public\neducation is a system of public mesmerism, and, now that we see it in\nits effects, may be truly described as a national disease.\nI have said that England is not nationalist. If the English believed in\nEngland as the Germans believe in Germany, there would be nothing for\nit but a duel to the death, the extinction of one people or the other,\nand darkness as the burier of the dead. Peace would be attained by a\ngreat simplification and impoverishment of the world. But the English do\nnot believe in themselves in that mad-bull fashion. They come of mixed\nblood, and have been accustomed for many long centuries to settle their\ndifferences by compromise and mutual accommodation. They do not inquire\ntoo curiously into a man’s descent if he shares their ideas. They have\nshown again and again that they prefer a tolerant and intelligent\nforeigner to rule over them rather than an obstinate and wrong-headed\nman of native origin. The earliest strong union of the various parts of\nEngland was achieved by William the Norman, a man of French and\nScandinavian descent. Our native-born king, Charles the First, was put\nto death by his people; his son, James the Second, was banished, and the\nDutchman, William the Third, who had proved himself a statesman and\nsoldier of genius in his opposition to Louis the Fourteenth, was elected\nto the throne of England. The fierce struggles of the seventeenth\ncentury, between Royalists and Parliamentarians, between Cavaliers and\nPuritans, were settled at last, not by the destruction of either party,\nbut by the stereotyping of the dispute in the milder and more tolerable\nshape of the party system. The only people we have ever shown ourselves\nunwilling to tolerate are the people who will tolerate no one but their\nown kind. We hate all Acts of Uniformity with a deadly hatred. We are\ncareful for the rights of minorities. We think life should be made\npossible, and we do not object to its being made happy, for dissenters.\nVoltaire, the acutest French mind of his age, remarked on this when he\nvisited England in 1726. ’England’, he says, ’is the country of sects.\n\"In my father’s house are many mansions”.... Although the Episcopalians\nand the Presbyterians are the two dominant sects in Great Britain, all\nthe others are welcomed there, and live together very fairly, whilst\nmost of the preachers hate one another almost as cordially as a\nJansenist damns a Jesuit. Enter the London Exchange, a place much more\nworthy of respect than most Courts, and you see assembled for the\nbenefit of mankind representatives of all nations. There the Jew, the\nMohammedan, and the Christian deal with each other as if they were of\nthe same religion, and call infidels only those who become bankrupt.\nThere the Presbyterian trusts the Anabaptist, and the Anabaptist relies\non the promise of the Quaker. On leaving these free and peaceful\nassemblies, some proceed to the synagogue, others to the tavern.... If\nin England there were only one religion, its despotism would be to be\ndreaded; if there were only two, their followers would cut each other’s\nthroats; but there are thirty of them, and they live in peace and\nhappiness.’\nSince we have had so much practice in tolerating one another, and in\nliving together even when our ideas on life and the conduct of life seem\nabsolutely incompatible, it is no wonder that we approach the treatment\nof international affairs in a temper very unlike the solemn and dogmatic\nferocity of the German. We do not expect or desire that other peoples\nshall resemble us. The world is wide; and the world-drama is enriched\nby multiplicity and diversity of character. We like bad men, if there is\nsalt and spirit in their badness. We even admire a brute, if he is a\nwhole-hearted brute. I have often thought that if the Germans had been\ntrue to their principles and their programme–if, after proclaiming that\nthey meant to win by sheer strength and that they recognized no other\nright, they had continued as they began, and had battered and hacked,\nburned and killed, without fear or pity, a certain reluctant admiration\nfor them might have been felt in this country. There is no chance of\nthat now, since they took to whining about humanity. Yet it is very\ndifficult wholly to alienate the sympathies of the English people. It is\nperhaps in some ways a weakness, as it is certainly in other ways a\nstrength, that we are fanciers of other peoples. Our soldiers have a\ntendency to make pets of their prisoners, to cherish them as curiosities\nand souvenirs. The fancy becomes a passion when we find a little fellow\nstruggling valiantly against odds. I suppose we should be at war with\nGermany to-day, even if the Germans had respected the neutrality of\nBelgium. But the unprovoked assault upon a little people that asked only\nto be let alone united all opinions in this country and brought us in\nwith a rush. I believe there is one German, at least (I hope he is\nalive), who understands this. Early in July, 1914, a German student at\nOxford, who was a friend and pupil of mine, came to say good-bye to me.\nI have since wondered whether he was under orders to join his regiment.\nAnyhow, we talked very freely of many things, and he told me of an\nadventure that had befallen him in an Oxford picture-palace. Portraits\nof notabilities were being thrown on the screen. When a portrait of the\nGerman Emperor appeared, a youth, sitting just behind my friend, shouted\nout an insulting and scurrilous remark. So my friend stood up and turned\nround and, catching him a cuff on the head, said,’That’s my emperor’.\nThe house was full of undergraduates, and he expected to be seized and\nthrown into the street. To his great surprise the undergraduates, many\nof whom have now fallen on the fields of France, broke into rounds of\ncheering. ’I should like to think’, my friend said, ’that a thing like\nthat could possibly happen in a German city, but I am afraid that the\nfeeling there would always be against the foreigner. I admire the\nEnglish; they are so just.’ I have heard nothing of him since, except a\nrumour that he is with the German army of occupation in Belgium. If so,\nI like to think of him at a regimental mess, suggesting doubts, or, if\nthat is an impossible breach of military discipline, keeping silence,\nwhen the loud-voiced major explains that the sympathy of the English for\nBelgium is all pretence and cant.\nIdeal and disinterested motives are always to be reckoned with in human\nnature. What the Germans call ’real politics’, that is to say, politics\nwhich treat disinterested motives as negligible, have led them into a\nmorass and have bogged them there. How easy it is to explain that the\nBritish Empire depends on trade, that we are a nation of traders, that\nall our policy is shaped by trade, that therefore it can only be\nhypocrisy in us to pretend to any of the finer feelings. This is not,\nas you might suppose, the harmless sally of a one-eyed wit; it is the\ncarefully reasoned belief of Germany’s profoundest political thinkers.\nThey do not understand a cavalier, so they confidently assert that there\nis no such thing in nature. That is a bad mistake to make about any\nnation, but perhaps worst when it is made about the English, for the\ncavalier temper in England runs through all classes. You can find it in\nthe schoolmaster, the small trader, the clerk, and the labourer, as\nreadily as in the officer of dragoons, or the Arctic explorer. The\nRoundheads won the Civil War, and bequeathed to us their political\nachievements. From the Cavaliers we have a more intimate bequest: it is\nfrom them, not from the Puritans, that the fighting forces of the\nBritish Empire inherit their outlook on the world, their freedom from\npedantry, and that gaiety and lightness of courage which makes them\ncarry their lives like a feather in the cap.\nI am not saying that our qualities, good or bad, commend us very readily\nto strangers. The people of England, on the whole, are respected more\nthan they are liked. When I call them fanciers of other nations, I feel\nit only fair to add that some of those other nations express the same\ntruth in different language. I have often heard the complaint made that\nEnglishmen cannot speak of foreigners without an air of patronage. It is\nimpossible to deny this charge, for, in a question of manners, the\nimpressions you produce are your manners; and there is no doubt about\nthis impression. There is a certain coldness about the upright and\nhumane Englishman which repels and intimidates any trivial human being\nwho approaches him. Most men would forgo their claim to justice for the\nchance of being liked. They would rather have their heads broken, or\naccept a bribe, than be the objects of a dispassionate judgement,\nhowever kindly. They feel this so strongly that they experience a dull\ndiscomfort in any relationship that is not tinctured with passion. As\nthere are many such relationships, not to be avoided even by the most\nemotional natures, they escape from them by simulating lively feeling,\nand are sometimes exaggerated and insincere in manner. They issue a very\nlarge paper currency on a very small gold reserve. This, which is\ncommonly known as the Irish Question, is an insoluble problem, for it is\na clash not of interests but of temperaments. The English, it must in\nfairness be admitted, do as they would be done by. No Englishman pure\nand simple is incommoded by the coldness of strangers. He prefers it,\nfor there are many stupid little businesses in the world, which are\nfalsified when they are made much of; and even when important facts are\nto be told, he would rather have them told in a dreary manner. He hates\na fuss.\nThe Germans, who are a highly emotional and excitable people, have\nconcentrated all their energy on a few simple ideas. Their moral outlook\nis as narrow as their geographical outlook is wide. Will their faith\nprevail by its intensity, narrow and false though it be? I cannot prove\nthat it will not, but I have a suspicion, which I think has already\noccurred to some of them, that the world is too large and wilful and\nstrong to be mastered by them. We have seen what their hatchets and\nexplosives can do, and they are nearing the end of their resources. They\ncan still repeat some of their old exploits, but they make no headway,\nand time is not their friend.\nOne service, perhaps, they have done to civilization. There is a growing\nnumber of people who hold that when this War is over international\nrelations must not be permitted to slip back into the unstable condition\nwhich tempted the Germans to their crime. A good many pacific theorists,\nno doubt, have not the experience and the imagination which would enable\nthem to pass a useful judgement, or to make a valuable suggestion, on\nthe affairs of nations. The abolition of war would be easily obtained if\nit were generally agreed that war is the worst thing that can befall a\npeople. But this is not generally agreed; and, further, it is not true.\nWhile men are men they cannot be sure that they will never be challenged\non a point of deep and intimate concern, where they would rather die\nthan yield. But something can perhaps be done to discourage gamblers’\nwars, though even here any stockbroker will tell you how difficult it is\nto suppress gambling without injuring the spirit of enterprise. The only\nreal check on war is an understanding between nations. For the\nstrengthening of such an understanding the Allies have a great\nopportunity, and admirable instruments. I do not think that we shall\ncall on Germany to preside at our conferences. But we shall have the\nhelp of all those qualities of heart and mind which are possessed by\nFrance, by Russia, by Italy, and by America, who, for all her caution,\nhates cruelty even more than she loves peace. There has never been an\nalliance of greater promise for the government and peace of the world.\nWhat is the contribution of the British Empire, and of England, towards\nthis settlement? Many of our domestic problems, as I have said, bear a\ncurious resemblance to international problems. We have not solved them\nall. We have had many stumblings and many backslidings. But we have\nshown again and again that we believe in toleration on the widest\npossible basis, and that we are capable of generosity, which is a virtue\nmuch more commonly shown by private persons than by communities. We\nabolished the slave trade. We granted self-government to South Africa\njust after our war with her. Only a few days ago we gave India her will,\nand allowed her to impose a duty on our manufactures. Ireland could have\nself-government to-morrow if she did not value her feuds more than\nanything else in the world. All these are peoples to whom we have been\nbound by ties of kinship or trusteeship. A wider and greater opportunity\nis on its way to us. We are to see whether we are capable of generosity\nand trust towards peoples who are neither our kin nor our wards. Our\nunderstanding with France and Russia will call for great goodwill on\nboth sides, not so much in the drafting of formal treaties as in\nindulging one another in our national habits. Families who fail to live\ntogether in unity commonly fail not because they quarrel about large\ninterests, but because they do not like each other’s little ways. The\nFrench are not a dull people; and the Russians are not a tedious people\n(what they do they do suddenly, without explanation); so that if we\nfail to take pleasure in them we have ourselves to blame. If we are not\nequal to our opportunities, if we do not learn to feel any affection for\nthem, then not all the pacts and congresses in the world can make peace\nsecure.\nOf Germany it is too early to speak. We have not yet defeated her. If we\ndo defeat her, no one who is acquainted with our temper and our record\nbelieves that we shall impose cruel or vindictive terms. If it were only\nthe engineers of this war who were in question, we would destroy them\ngladly as common pests. But the thing is not so easy. A single home is\nin many ways a greater and more appealing thing than a nation; we should\nfind ourselves thinking of the miseries of simple and ignorant people\nwho have given their all for the country of their birth; and our hearts\nwould fail us.\nThe Germans would certainly despise this address of mine, for I have\ntalked only of morality, while they talk and think chiefly of machines.\nZeppelins are a sad disappointment; but if any address on the War is\nbeing delivered to-night by a German professor, there can be no doubt\nthat it deals with submarines, and treats them as the saviours of the\nFatherland. Well, I know very little about submarines, but I notice that\nthey have not had much success against ships of war. We are so\neasy-going that we expected to carry on our commerce in war very much as\nwe did in peace. We have to change all that, and it will cost us not a\nlittle inconvenience, or even great hardships. But I cannot believe that\na scheme of privy attacks on the traders of all nations, devised as a\nlast resort, in lieu of naval victory, can be successful when it is no\nlonger a surprise. And when I read history, I am strengthened in my\nbelief that morality is all-important. I do not find that any war\nbetween great nations was ever won by a machine. The Trojan horse will\nbe trotted out against me, but that was a municipal affair. Wars are won\nby the temper of a people. Serbia is not yet defeated. It is a frenzied\nand desperate quest that the Germans undertook when they began to seek\nfor some mechanical trick or dodge, some monstrous engine, which should\nenable the less resolved and more excited people to defeat the more\nresolved and less excited. If we are to be defeated, it must be by them,\nnot by their bogey-men. We got their measure on the Somme, and we found\nthat when their guns failed to protect them, many of them threw up their\nhands. These men will never be our masters until we deserve to be their\nslaves.\nSo I am glad to be able to end on a note of agreement with the German\nmilitary party. If they defeat us, it will be no more than we deserve.\nTill then, or till they throw up their hands, we shall fight them, and\nGod will defend the right.\nSome Gains of the War\nAn Address to the Royal Colonial Institute, February 13, 1918\nOur losses in this War continue to be enormous, and we are not yet near\nto the end. So it may seem absurd to speak of our gains, of gains that\nwe have already achieved. But if you will look at the thing in a large\nlight, I think you will see that it is not absurd.\nI do not speak of gains of territory, and prisoners, and booty. It is\ntrue that we have taken from the Germans about a million square miles of\nland in Africa, where land is cheap. We have taken more prisoners from\nthem than they have taken from us, and we have whole parks of German\nartillery to set over against the battered and broken remnants of\nBritish field-guns which were exhibited in Berlin–a monument to the\nimmortal valour of the little old Army. I am speaking rather of gains\nwhich cannot be counted as guns are counted, or measured as land is\nmeasured, but which are none the less real and important.\nThe Germans have achieved certain great material gains in this War, and\nthey are fighting now to hold them. If they fail to hold them, the\nGermany of the war-lords is ruined. She will have to give up all her\nbloated ambitions, to purge and live cleanly, and painfully to\nreconstruct her prosperity on a quieter and sounder basis. She will not\ndo this until she is forced to it by defeat. No doubt there are moderate\nand sensible men in Germany, as in other countries; but in Germany they\nare without influence, and can do nothing. War is the national industry\nof Prussia; Prussia has knit together the several states of the larger\nGermany by means of war, and has promised them prosperity and power in\nthe future, to be achieved by war. You know the Prussian doctrine of\nwar. Every one now knows it. According to that doctrine it is a foolish\nthing for a nation to wait till it is attacked. It should carefully\ncalculate its own strength and the strength of its neighbours, and, when\nit is ready, it should attack them, on any pretext, suddenly, without\nwarning, and should take from them money and land. When it has gained\nterritory in this fashion, it should subject the population of the\nconquered territory to the strictest laws of military service, and so\nsupply itself with an instrument for new and bolder aggression. This is\nnot only the German doctrine; it is the German practice. In this way and\nno other modern Germany has been built up. It is a huge new State,\nfounded on force, cemented by fear, and financed on speculative gains to\nbe derived from the great gamble of war. You may have noticed that the\nGerman people have not been called on, as yet, to pay any considerable\nsum in taxation towards the expenses of this war. Those expenses (that,\nat least, was the original idea) were to be borne wholly by the\nconquered enemy. There are hundreds of thousands of Germans to-day who\nfirmly believe that their war-lords will return in triumph from the\nstricken field, bringing with them the spoils of war, and scattering a\nlargess of peace and plenty.\nTo us it seems a marvel that any people should accept such a doctrine,\nand should willingly give their lives and their fortunes to the work of\ncarrying it out in practice; but it is not so marvellous as it seems.\nThe German peoples are brave and obedient, and so make good soldiers;\nthey are easily lured by the hope of profit; they are naturally\nattracted by the spectacular and sentimental side of war; above all,\nthey are so curiously stupid that many of them do actually believe that\nthey are a divinely chosen race, superior to the other races of the\nworld. They are very carefully educated, and their education, which is\nordered by the State, is part of the military machine. Their thinking is\ndone for them by officials. It would require an extraordinary degree of\ncourage and independence for a German youth to cut himself loose and\nbegin thinking and judging for himself. It must always be remembered,\nmoreover, that their recent history seems to justify their creed. I will\nnot go back to Frederick the Great, though the history of his wars is\nthe Prussian handbook, which teaches all the characteristic Prussian\nmethods of treachery and deceit. But consider only the last two German\nwars. How, in the face of these, can it be proved to any German that war\nis not the most profitable of adventures? In 1866 Prussia had war with\nAustria. The war lasted forty days, and Prussia had from five to six\nthousand soldiers killed in action. As a consequence of the war Prussia\ngained much territory, and established her control over the states of\ngreater Germany. In 1870 she had war with France. Her total casualties\nin that war were approximately a hundred thousand, just about the same\nas our casualties in Gallipoli. From the war she gained, besides a great\nincrease of strength at home, the rich provinces of Alsace and Lorraine,\nwith all their mineral wealth, and an indemnity of two hundred million\npounds, that is to say, four times the actual cost of the war in money.\nHow then can it be maintained that war is not good business? If you say\nso to any Prussian, he thinks you are talking like a child.\nNot only were these two wars rich in profit for the Germans, but they\ndid not lose them much esteem. There was sympathy in this country for\nthe union of the German peoples, just as there was sympathy, a few years\nearlier, for the union of the various states of Italy. There was not a\nlittle admiration for German efficiency and strength. So that Bismarck,\nwho was an expert in all the uses of bullying, blackmail, and fraud, was\naccepted as a great European statesman. I have always believed, and I\nstill believe, that Germany will have to pay a heavy price for\nBismarck–all the heavier because the payment has been so long deferred.\nThe present War, then, is in the direct line of succession to these\nformer wars; it was planned by Germany, elaborately and deliberately\nplanned, on a calculation of the profits to be derived from operations\non a large scale.\nWell, as I said, we, as a people, do not believe in gambling in human\nmisery to attain uncertain speculative gains. We hold that war can be\njustified only by a good cause, not by a lucky event. The German\ndoctrine seems to us impious and wicked. Though we have defined our war\naims in detail, and the Germans have not dared publicly to define\ntheirs, our real and sufficient war aim is to break the monstrous and\ninhuman doctrine and practice of the enemy–to make their calculations\nmiscarry. And observe, if their calculations miscarry, they have fought\nand suffered for nothing. They entered into this War for profit, and in\nthe conduct of the War, though they have made many mistakes, they have\nmade none of those generous and magnanimous mistakes which redeem and\nbeautify a losing cause.\nThe essence of our cause, and its greatest strength, is that we are not\nfighting for profit. We are fighting for no privilege except the\nprivilege of possessing our souls, of being ourselves–a privilege which\nwe claim also for other weaker nations. The inestimable strength of that\nposition is that if the odds are against us it does not matter. If you\nsee a ruffian torturing a child, and interfere to prevent him, do you\nfeel that your attempt was a wrong one because he knocks you down? And\nif you succeed, what material profit is there in saving a child from\ntorture? We have sometimes fought in the past for doubtful causes and\nfor wrong causes, but this time there is no mistake. Our cause is better\nthan we deserve; we embraced it by an act of faith, and it is only by\ncontinuing in that faith that we shall see it through. The little old\nArmy, when they went to France in August 1914, did not ask what profits\nwere likely to come their way. They knew that there were none, but they\nwere willing to sacrifice themselves to save decency and humanity from\nbeing trampled in the mud. This was the Army that the Germans called a\nmercenary Army, and its epitaph has been written by a good poet:\n     These, in the day when heaven was falling,\n     The hour when earth’s foundations fled,\n     Followed their mercenary calling,\n     And took their wages, and are dead.\n     Their shoulders held the heavens suspended,\n     They stood, and earth’s foundations stay,\n     What God abandoned these defended,\n     And saved the sum of things for pay.\nWe must follow their example, for we shall never get a better. We must\nnot make too much of calculation, especially when it deals with\nincalculable things. Nervous public critics, like Mr. H.G. Wells, are\nalways calling out for more cleverness in our methods, for new and\neffective tricks, so that we may win the War. I would never disparage\ncleverness; the more you can get of it, the better; but it is useless\nunless it is in the service of something stronger and greater than\nitself, and that is character. Cleverness can grasp; it is only\ncharacter that can hold. The Duke of Wellington was not a clever man; he\nwas a man of simple and honourable mind, with an infinite capacity for\npatience, persistence, and endurance, so that neither unexpected\nreverses abroad nor a flood of idle criticism at home could shake him or\nchange him. So he bore a chief part in laying low the last great tyranny\nthat desolated Europe.\nNone of our great wars was won by cleverness; they were all won by\nresolution and perseverance. In all of them we were near to despair and\ndid not despair. In all of them we won through to victory in the end.\nBut in none of them did victory come in the expected shape. The worst of\nmaking elaborate plans of victory, and programmes of all that is to\nfollow victory, is that the mixed event is sure to defeat those plans.\nNot every war finds its decision in a single great battle. Think of our\nwar with Spain in the sixteenth century. Spain was then the greatest of\nEuropean Powers. She had larger armies than we could raise; she had\nmore than our wealth, and more than our shipping. The newly discovered\ncontinent of America was an appanage of Spain, and her great galleons\nwere wafted lazily to and fro, bringing her all the treasures of the\nwestern hemisphere. We defeated her by standing out and holding on. We\nfought her in the Low Countries, which she enslaved and oppressed. We\nrefused to recognize her exclusive rights in America, and our merchant\nseamen kept the sea undaunted, as they have kept it for the last three\nyears. When at last we became an intolerable vexation to Spain, she\ncollected a great Armada, or war-fleet, to invade and destroy us; and it\nwas shattered, by the winds of heaven and the sailors of England, in\n1588. The defeat of the Armada was the turning-point of the war, but it\nwas not the end. It lifted a great shadow of fear from the hearts of the\npeople, as a great shadow of fear has already been lifted from their\nhearts in the present War, but during the years that followed we\nsuffered many and serious reverses at the hand of Spain, before peace\nand security were reached. So late as 1601, thirteen years after the\ndefeat of the Armada, the King of Denmark offered to mediate between\nEngland and Spain, so that the long and disastrous war might be ended.\nQueen Elizabeth was then old and frail, but this was what she said–and\nif you want to understand why she was almost adored by her people,\nlisten to her words: ’I would have the King of Denmark, and all Princes\nChristian and Heathen to know, that England hath no need to crave peace;\nnor myself endured one hour’s fear since I attained the crown thereof,\nbeing guarded with so valiant and faithful subjects.’ In the end the\npower and menace of Spain faded away, and when peace was made, in 1604,\nthis nation never again, from that day to this, feared the worst that\nSpain could do.\nWhat were our gains from the war with Spain? Freedom to live our lives\nin our own way, unthreatened; freedom to colonize America. The gains of\na great war are never visible immediately; they are deferred, and\nextended over many years. What did we gain by our war with Napoleon,\nwhich ended in the victory of Waterloo? For long years after Waterloo\nthis country was full of riots and discontents; there were\nrick-burnings, agitations, popular risings, and something very near to\nfamine in the land. But all these things, from a distance, are now seen\nto have been the broken water that follows the passage of a great storm.\nThe real gains of Waterloo, and still more of Trafalgar, are evident in\nthe enormous commercial and industrial development of England during the\nnineteenth century, and in the peaceful foundation of the great\ndominions of Canada, Australia, and South Africa, which was made\npossible only by our unchallenged use of the seas. The men who won those\ntwo great battles did not live to gather the fruits of their victory;\nbut their children did. If we defeat Germany as completely as we hope,\nwe shall not be able to point at once to our gains. But it is not a rash\nforecast to say that our children and children’s children will live in\ngreater security and freedom than we have ever tasted.\nA man must have a good and wide imagination if he is to be willing to\nface wounds and death for the sake of his unborn descendants and\nkinsfolk. We cannot count on the popular imagination being equal to the\ntask. Fortunately, there is a substitute for imagination which does the\nwork as well or better, and that is character. Our people are sound in\ninstinct; they understand a fight. They know that a wrestler who\nconsiders, while he is in the grip of his adversary, whether he would\nnot do well to give over, and so put an end to the weariness and the\nstrain, is no sort of a wrestler. They have never failed under a strain\nof this kind, and they will not fail now. The people who do the\nhalf-hearted and timid talking are either young egotists, who are angry\nat being deprived of their personal ease and independence; or elderly\npensive gentlemen, in public offices and clubs, who are no longer fit\nfor action, and, being denied action, fall into melancholy; or feverish\njournalists, who live on the proceeds of excitement, who feel the pulse\nand take the temperature of the War every morning, and then rush into\nthe street to announce their fluttering hopes and fears; or cosmopolitan\nphilosophers, to whom the change from London to Berlin means nothing but\na change in diet and a pleasant addition to their opportunities of\nhearing good music; or aliens in heart, to whom the historic fame of\nEngland, ’dear for her reputation through the world,’ is less than\nnothing; or practical jokers, who are calm and confident enough\nthemselves, but delight in startling and depressing others. These are\nnot the people of England; they are the parasites of the people of\nEngland. The people of England understand a fight.\nThat brings me to the first great gain of the War. We have found\nourselves. Which of us, in the early months of 1914, would have dared\nto predict the splendours of the youth of this Empire–splendours which\nare now a part of our history? We are adepts at self-criticism and\nself-depreciation. We hate the language of emotion. Some of us, if we\nwere taken to heaven and asked what we thought of it, would say that it\nis decent, or not so bad. I suppose we are jealous to keep our standard\nhigh, and to have something to say if a better place should be found.\nBut in spite of all this, we do now know, and it is worth knowing, that\nwe are not weaker than our fathers. We know that the people who inhabit\nthese islands and this commonwealth of nations cannot be pushed on one\nside, or driven under, or denied a great share in the future ordering of\nthe world. We know this, and our knowledge of it is the debt that we owe\nto our dead. It is not vanity to admit that we know it; on the contrary,\nit would be vanity to pretend that we do not know it. It is visible to\nother eyes than ours. Some time ago I heard an address given by a friend\nof mine, an Indian Mohammedan of warrior descent, to University students\nof his own faith. He was urging on them the futility of dreams and the\nnecessity of self-discipline and self-devotion. ’Why do the people of\nthis country’, he said, ’count for so much all the world over? It is not\nbecause of their dreams; it is because thousands of them are lying at\nthe bottom of the sea.’\nFurther, we have not only found ourselves; we have found one another. A\nnew kindliness has grown up, during the War, between people divided by\nthe barriers of class, or wealth, or circumstance. A statesman of the\nseventeenth century remarks that It is a Misfortune for a Man not to\nhave a Friend in the World, but for that reason he shall have no Enemy.\nI might invert his maxim and say, It is a Misfortune for a Man to have\nmany Enemies, but for that reason he shall know who are his Friends. No\nRadical member of Parliament will again, while any of us live, cast\ncontempt on ’the carpet Captains of Mayfair’. No idle Tory talker will\nagain dare to say that the working men of England care nothing for their\ncountry. Even the manners of railway travel have improved. I was\ntravelling in a third-class compartment of a crowded train the other\nday; we were twenty in the compartment, but it seemed a pity to leave\nany one behind, and we made room for number twenty-one. Nothing but a\nvery kindly human feeling could have packed us tight enough for this.\nYet now is the time that has been chosen by some of these pensive\ngentlemen that I spoke of, and by some of these excitable journalists,\nto threaten us with class-war, and to try to make our flesh creep by\nconjuring up the horrors of revolution. I advise them to take their\nopinions to the third-class compartment and discuss them there. It is a\ngood tribunal, for, sooner or later, you will find every one there–even\nofficers, when they are travelling in mufti at their own expense. I have\nvisited this tribunal very often, and I have always come away from it\nwith the same impression, that this people means to win the War. But I\ndo not travel much in the North of England, so I asked a friend of mine,\nwhose dealings are with the industrial North, what the workpeople of\nLancashire and Yorkshire think of the War. He said, ’Their view is very\nsimple: they mean to win it; and they mean to make as much money out of\nit as ever they can.’ Certainly, that is very simple; but before you\njudge them, put yourselves in their place. There are great outcries\nagainst profiteers, for making exorbitant profits out of the War, and\nagainst munition workers, for delaying work in order to get higher\nwages. I do not defend either of them; they are unimaginative and\nselfish, and I do not care how severely they are dealt with; but I do\nsay that the majority of them are not wicked in intention. A good many\nof the more innocent profiteers are men whose sin is that they take an\noffer of two shillings rather than an offer of eighteenpence for what\ncost them one and a penny. Some of us, in our weaker moments, might be\nbetrayed into doing the same. As for the munition workers, I remember\nwhat Goldsmith, who had known the bitterest poverty, wrote to his\nbrother. ’Avarice’, he said, ’in the lower orders of mankind is true\nambition; avarice is the only ladder the poor can use to preferment.\nPreach then, my dear Sir, to your son, not the excellence of human\nnature nor the disrespect of riches, but endeavour to teach him thrift\nand economy. Let his poor wandering uncle’s example be placed in his\neyes. I had learned from books to love virtue before I was taught from\nexperience the necessity of being selfish.’\nThe profiteers and the munition workers are endeavouring, incidentally,\nto better their own position. But make no mistake; the bulk of these\npeople would rather die than allow one spire of English grass to be\ntrodden under the foot of a foreign trespasser. Their chief sin is that\nthey do not fear. They think that there is plenty of time to do a little\nbusiness for themselves on the way to defeat the enemy. I cannot help\nremembering the mutiny at the Nore, which broke out in our fleet during\nthe Napoleonic wars. The mutineers struck for more pay and better\ntreatment, but they agreed together that if the French fleet should put\nin an appearance during the mutiny, all their claims should be postponed\nfor a time, and the French fleet should have their first attention.\nEmployers and employed do, no doubt, find in some trades to-day that\ntheir relations are strained and irksome. They would do well to take a\nlesson from the Army, where, with very few exceptions, there is harmony\nand understanding between those who take orders and those who give them.\nIt is only in the Army that you can see realized the ideal of ancient\nRome.\n     Then none was for a party,\n       Then all were for the State;\n     Then the great man helped the poor,\n       And the poor man loved the great.\nWhy is the Army so far superior to most commercial and industrial\nbusinesses? The secret does not lie in State employment. There is plenty\nof discontent and unrest among the State-employed railway men and\nmunition workers. It lies rather in the habit of mutual help and mutual\ntrust. If any civilian employer of labour wants to have willing\nworkpeople, let him take a hint from the Army. Let him live with his\nworkpeople, and share all their dangers and discomforts. Let him take\nthought for their welfare before his own, and teach self-sacrifice by\nexample. Let him put the good of the nation before all private\ninterests; and those whom he commands will do for him anything that he\nasks.\nI cannot believe that the benefits which have come to us from the Army\nwill pass away with the passing of the War. Those who have been comrades\nin danger will surely take with them something of the old spirit into\ncivil life. And those who have kept clear of the Army in order to carry\non their own trades and businesses will surely realize that they have\nmissed the great opportunity of their lives.\nIn a wider sense the War has brought us to an understanding of one\nanother. This great Commonwealth of independent nations which is called\nthe British Empire is scattered over the surface of the habitable globe.\nIt embraces people who live ten thousand miles apart, and whose ways of\nlife are so different that they might seem to have nothing in common.\nBut the War has brought them together, and has done more than half a\ncentury of peace could do to promote a common understanding. Hundreds of\nthousands of men of our blood who, before the War, had never seen this\nlittle island, have now made acquaintance with it. Hundreds of thousands\nof the inhabitants of this island to whom the Dominions were strange,\nfar places, if, after the War, they should be called on to settle there,\nwill not feel that they are leaving home. I can only hope that the\nCanadians and Anzacs think as well of us as we do of them. We do not\nlike to praise our friends in their hearing, so I will say no more than\nthis: I am told that a new kind of peerage, very haughty and very\nself-important, has arisen in South London. Its members are those\nhouse-holders who have been privileged to have Anzac soldiers billeted\non them. It is private ties of this kind, invisible to the\nconstitutional lawyer and the political historian, which make the fine\nmeshes of the web of Empire.\nBecause he knew that the strength of the whole texture depends on the\nstrength of the fine meshes, Earl Grey, who died last year, will always\nbe remembered in our history. Not many men have his opportunity to make\nacquaintance with the domain that is their birthright, for he had\nadministered a province of South Africa, and had been Governor-General\nof Canada, He rediscovered the glory of the Empire, as poets rediscover\nthe glory of common speech. ’He had breathed its air,’ a friend of his\nsays, ’fished its rivers, walked in its valleys, stood on its mountains,\nmet its people face to face. He had seen it in all the zones of the\nworld. He knew what it meant to mankind. Under the British flag,\nwherever he journeyed, he found men of English speech living in an\natmosphere of liberty and carrying on the dear domestic traditions of\nthe British Isles. He saw justice firmly planted there, industry and\ninvention hard at work unfettered by tyrants of any kind, domestic life\nprospering in natural conditions, and our old English kindness and\ncheerfulness and broad-minded tolerance keeping things together. But he\nalso saw room under that same flag, ample room, for millions and\nmillions more of the human race. The Empire wasn’t a word to him. It was\na vast, an almost boundless, home for honest men.’\nThe War did not dishearten him. When he died, in August, 1917, he said,\n’Here I lie on my death-bed, looking clear into the Promised Land. I’m\nnot allowed to enter it, but there it is before my eyes. After the War\nthe people of this country will enter it, and those who laughed at me\nfor a dreamer will see that I wasn’t so wrong after all. But there’s\nstill work to do for those who didn’t laugh, hard work, and with much\nopposition in the way; all the same, it is work right up against the\ngoal. My dreams have come true.’\nOne of the clear gains of the War is to be found in the increased\nactivity and alertness of our own people. The motto of to-day is, ’Let\nthose now work who never worked before, And those who always worked now\nwork the more.’ Before the War we had a great national reputation for\nidleness–in this island, at least. I remember a friendly critic from\nCanada who, some five or six years ago, expressed to me, with much\ndisquiet, his opinion that there was something very far wrong with the\nold country; that we had gone soft. As for our German critics, they\nexpressed the same view in gross and unmistakable fashion. Wit is not a\nnative product in Germany, it all has to be imported, so they could not\nsatirize us; but their caricatures of the typical Englishman showed us\nwhat they thought. He was a young weakling with a foolish face, and was\ndressed in cricketing flannels. It would have been worth their while to\nnotice what they did not notice, that his muscles and nerves are not\nsoft. They learned that later, when the bank-clerks of Manchester broke\nthe Prussian Guard into fragments at Contalmaison. This must have been a\nsad surprise, for the Germans had always taught, in their delightful\nauthoritative fashion, that the chief industries of the young Englishman\nare lawn-tennis and afternoon tea. They are a fussy people, and they\nfind it difficult to understand the calm of the man who, having nothing\nto do, does it. Perhaps they were right, and we were too idle. The\ndisease was never so serious as they thought it, and now, thanks to\nthem, we are in a fair way to recovery. The idle classes have turned\ntheir hand to the lathe and the plough. Women are doing a hundred things\nthat they never did before, and are doing them well. The elasticity and\nresourcefulness that the War has developed will not be lost or destroyed\nby the coming of peace. Least of all will those qualities be lost if we\nshould prove unable, in this War, to impose our own terms on Germany.\nThen the peace that follows will be a long struggle, and in that\nstruggle we shall prevail. In the last long peace we were not\nsuspicious; we felt friendly enough to the Germans, and we gave them\nevery advantage. They despised us for our friendliness and used the\npeace to prepare our downfall. That will never happen again. If we\ncannot tame the cunning animal that has assaulted humanity, at least we\ncan and will tether him. Laws will not be necessary; there are millions\nof others besides the seamen of England who will have no dealings with\nan unsubdued and unrepentant Germany. What the Germans are not taught by\nthe War they will have to learn in the more tedious and no less costly\nschool of peace.\nIn any case, whether we win through to real peace and real security, or\nwhether we are thrown back on an armed peace and the duty of unbroken\nvigilance, we shall be dependent for our future on the children who are\nnow learning in the schools or playing in the streets. It is a good\ndependence. The children of to-day are better than the children whom I\nknew when I was a child. I think they have more intelligence and\nsympathy; they certainly have more public spirit. We cannot do too much\nfor them. The most that we can do is nothing to what they are going to\ndo for us, for their own nation and people. I am not concerned to\ndiscuss the education problem. Formal education, carried on chiefly by\nmeans of books, is a very small part of the making of a man or a woman.\nBut I am interested to know what the children are thinking. You cannot\nfathom a child’s thoughts, but we know who are their best teachers, and\nwhat lessons have been stamped indelibly on their minds. Their teachers,\nwhom they never saw, and whose lessons they will never forget, lie in\ngraves in Flanders and France and Gallipoli and Syria and Mesopotamia,\nor unburied at the bottom of the sea. The runner falls, but the torch is\ncarried forward. This is what Julian Grenfell, who gave his mind and his\nlife to the War, has said in his splendid poem called Into Battle:\n     And life is colour and warmth and light,\n     And a striving evermore for these;\n     And he is dead who will not fight,\n     And who dies fighting hath increase.\nThose who died fighting will have such increase that a whole new\ngeneration, better even than the old, will be ready, no long time hence,\nto uphold and extend and decorate the Commonwealth of nations which\ntheir fathers and brothers saved from ruin.\nOne thing I have never heard discussed, but it is the clearest gain of\nall, and already it may be called a certain gain. After the War the\nEnglish language will have such a position as it has never had before.\nIt will be established in world-wide security. Even before the War, it\nmay be truly said, our language was in no danger from the competition of\nthe German language. The Germans have never had much success in the\nattempt to get their language adopted by other peoples. Not all the\nmilitary laws of Prussia can drive out French from the hearts and homes\nof the people of Alsace. In the ports of the near and far East you will\nhear English spoken–pidgin English, as it is called, that is to say, a\nselection of English words suited for the business of daily life. But\nyou may roam the world over, and you will hear no pidgin German. Before\nthe War many Germans learned English, while very few English-speaking\npeople learned German. In other matters we disagreed, but we both knew\nwhich way the wind was blowing. It may be said, and said truly, that our\nwell-known laziness was one cause of our failing or neglecting to learn\nGerman. But it was not the only cause; and we are not lazy in tasks\nwhich we believe to be worth our while. Rather we had an instinctive\nbelief that the future does not belong to the German tongue. That belief\nis not likely to be impaired by the War. Armed ruffians can do some\nthings, but one thing they cannot do; they cannot endear their language\nto those who have suffered from their violence. The Germans poisoned the\nwells in South-West Africa; in Europe they did all they could to poison\nthe wells of mutual trust and mutual understanding among civilized men.\nDo they think that these things will make a good advertisement for the\nexplosive guttural sounds and the huddled deformed syntax of the speech\nin which they express their arrogance and their hate? Which of the\nchief European languages will come first, after the War, with the little\nnations? Will Serbia be content to speak German? Will Norway and Denmark\nfeel a new affection for the speech of the men who have degraded the old\nhumanity of the seas? Neighbourhood, kinship, and the necessities of\ncommerce may retain for the German language a certain measure of custom\nin Sweden and Switzerland, and in Holland. But for the most part Germans\nwill have to be content to be addressed in their own tongue only by\nthose who fear them, or by those who hope to cheat them.\nThis gain, which I make bold to predict for the English language, is a\nreal gain, apart from all patriotic bias. The English language is\nincomparably richer, more fluid, and more vital than the German\nlanguage. Where the German has but one way of saying a thing, we have\ntwo or three, each with its distinctions and its subtleties of usage.\nOur capital wealth is greater, and so are our powers of borrowing.\nEnglish sprang from the old Teutonic stock, and we can still coin new\nwords, such as ’food-hoard’ and ’joy-ride’, in the German fashion. But\nlong centuries ago we added thousands of Romance words, words which came\ninto English through the French or Norman-French, and brought with them\nthe ideas of Latin civilization and of mediaeval Christianity. Later on,\nwhen the renewed study of Latin and Greek quickened the intellectual\nlife of Europe, we imported thousands of Greek and Latin words direct\nfrom the ancient world, learned words, many of them, suitable for\nphilosophers, or for writers who pride themselves on shooting a little\nabove the vulgar apprehension. Yet many of these, too, have found their\nway into daily speech, so that we can say most things in three ways,\naccording as we draw on one or another of the three main sources of our\nspeech. Thus, you can Begin, or Commence, or Initiate an undertaking,\nwith Boldness, or Courage, or Resolution. If you are a Workman, or\nLabourer, or Operative, you can Ask, or Bequest, or Solicit your\nemployer to Yield, or Grant, or Concede, an increase in the Earnings, or\nWages, or Remuneration which fall to the lot of your Fellow, or\nCompanion, or Associate. Your employer is perhaps Old, or Veteran, or\nSuperannuated, which may Hinder, or Delay, or Retard the success of your\napplication. But if you Foretell, or Prophesy, or Predict that the War\nwill have an End, or Close, or Termination that shall not only be\nSpeedy, or Rapid, or Accelerated, but also Great, or Grand, or\nMagnificent, you may perhaps Stir, or Move, or Actuate him to have Ruth,\nor Pity, or Compassion on your Mate, or Colleague, or Collaborator. The\nEnglish language, then, is a language of great wealth–much greater\nwealth than can be illustrated by any brief example. But wealth is\nnothing unless you can use it. The real strength of English lies in the\ninspired freedom and variety of its syntax. There is no grammar of the\nEnglish speech which is not comic in its stiffness and inadequacy. An\nEnglish grammar does not explain all that we can do with our speech; it\nmerely explains what shackles and restraints we must put upon our speech\nif we would bring it within the comprehension of a school-bred\ngrammarian. But the speech itself is like the sea, and soon breaks down\nthe dykes built by the inland engineer. It was the fashion, in the\neighteenth century, to speak of the divine Shakespeare. The reach and\ncatholicity of his imagination was what earned him that extravagant\npraise; but his syntax has no less title to be called divine. It is not\ncast or wrought, like metal; it leaps like fire, and moves like air. So\nis every one that is born of the spirit. Our speech is our great\ncharter. Far better than in the long constitutional process whereby we\nsubjected our kings to law, and gave dignity and strength to our\nCommons, the meaning of English freedom is to be seen in the illimitable\nfreedom of our English speech.\nOur literature is almost as rich as our language. Modern German\nliterature begins in the eighteenth century. Modern English literature\nbegan with Chaucer, in the fourteenth century, and has been full of\ngreat names and great books ever since. Nothing has been done in German\nliterature for which we have not a counterpart, done as well or\nbetter–except the work of Heine, and Heine was a Jew. His opinion of\nthe Prussians was that they are a compost of beer, deceit, and sand.\nFrench literature and English literature can be compared, throughout\ntheir long course, sometimes to the great advantage of the French.\nGerman literature cannot seriously be compared with either.\nIt may be objected that literature and art are ornamental affairs, which\ncount for little in the deadly strife of nations. But that is not so.\nOur language cannot go anywhere without taking our ideas and our creed\nwith it, not to mention our institutions and our games. If the Germans\ncould understand what Chaucer means when he says of his Knight that\n                     he lovèd chivalry,\n     Truth and honoùr, freedom and courtesy,\nthen indeed we might be near to an understanding. I asked a good German\nscholar the other day what is the German word for ’fair play’. He\nreplied, as they do in Parliament, that he must ask for notice of that\nquestion. I fear there is no German word for ’fair play’.\nThe little countries, the pawns and victims of German policy, understand\nour ideas better. The peoples who have suffered from tyranny and\noppression look to England for help, and it is a generous weakness in us\nthat we sometimes deceive them by our sympathy, for our power is\nlimited, and we cannot help them all. But it will not count against us\nat the final reckoning that in most places where humanity has suffered\ncruelty and indignity the name of England has been invoked: not always\nin vain.\nAnd now, for I have kept to the last what I believe to be the greatest\ngain of all, the entry of America into the War assures the triumph of\nour common language. America is peopled by many races; only a minority\nof the inhabitants–an influential and governing minority–are of the\nEnglish stock. But here, again, the language carries it; and the ideas\nthat inspire America are ideas which had their origin in the long\nEnglish struggle for freedom. Our sufferings in this War are great, but\nthey are not so great that we cannot recognize virtue in a new recruit\nto the cause. No nation, in the whole course of human history, has ever\nmade a more splendid decision, or performed a more magnanimous act, than\nAmerica, when she decided to enter this War. She had nothing to gain,\nfor, to say the bare truth, she had little to lose. If Germany were to\ndominate the world, America, no doubt, would be ruined; but in all human\nlikelihood, Germany’s impious attempt would have spent itself and been\nbroken long before it reached the coasts of America. America might have\nstood out of the War in the assurance that her own interests were safe,\nand that, when the tempest had passed, the centre of civilization would\nbe transferred from a broken and exhausted Europe to a peaceful and\nprosperous America. Some few Americans talked in this strain, and\nfavoured a decision in this sense. But it was not for nothing that\nAmerica was founded upon religion. When she saw humanity in anguish, she\ndid not pass by on the other side. Her entry into the War has put an\nend, I hope for ever, to the family quarrel, not very profound or\nsignificant, which for a century and a half has been a jarring note in\nthe relations of mother and daughter. And it has put an end to another\ndanger. It seemed at one time not unlikely that the English language as\nit is spoken overseas would set up a life of its own, and become\nseparated from the language of the old country. A development of this\nkind would be natural enough. The Boers of South Africa speak Dutch, but\nnot the Dutch spoken in Holland. The French Canadians speak French, but\nnot the French of Molière. Half a century ago, when America was\nexploring and settling her own country, in wild and lone places, her\npioneers enriched the English speech with all kinds of new and vivid\nphrases. The tendency was then for America to go her own way, and to\ncultivate what is new in language at the expense of what is old. She\nprided herself even on having a spelling of her own, and seemed almost\nwilling to break loose from tradition and to coin a new American\nEnglish.\nThis has not happened; and now, I think, it will not happen. For one\nthing, the American colonists left us when already we had a great\nliterature. Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Spenser belong to America no less\nthan to us, and America has never forgotten them. The education which\nhas been fostered in American schools and colleges keeps the whole\nnation in touch with the past. Some of their best authors write in a\nstyle that Milton and Burke would understand and approve. There is no\nmore beautiful English prose than Nathaniel Hawthorne’s. The best\nspeeches of Abraham Lincoln, and, we may truly add, of President Wilson,\nare merely classic English. During my own lifetime I am sure I have seen\nthe speech usages of the two peoples draw closer together. For one\nthing, we on this side now borrow, and borrow very freely, the more\npicturesque colloquialisms of America. On informal occasions I sometimes\nbrighten my own speech with phrases which I think I owe to one of the\nbest of living American authors, Mr. George Ade, of Chicago, the author\nof Fables in Slang. The press, the telegraph, the telephone, and the\ngrowing habit of travel bind us closer together every year; and the\nEnglish that we speak, however rich and various it may be, is going to\nremain one and the same English, our common inheritance.\nOne question, the most important and difficult of all, remains to be\nasked. Will this War, in its course and in its effects, tend to prevent\nor discourage later wars? If the gains that it brings prove to be merely\npartial and national gains, if it exalts one nation by unjustly\ndepressing another, and conquers cruelty by equal cruelty, then nothing\ncan be more certain than that the peace of the world is farther off than\never. When she was near her death, Edith Cavell, patriot and martyr,\nsaid that patriotism is not enough. Every one who thinks on\ninternational affairs knows this; almost every one forgets it in time of\nwar. What can be done to prevent nations from appealing to the wild\njustice of revenge?\nA League of Nations may do good, but I am surprised that any one who has\nimagination and a knowledge of the facts should entertain high hopes of\nit as a full solution. There is a League of Nations to-day which has\ngiven a verdict against the Central Powers, and that verdict is being\nenforced by the most terrible War in all human history. If the verdict\nhad been given before the War began, it may be said, then Germany might\nhave accepted it, and refrained. So she might, but what then? She would\nhave felt herself wronged; she would have deferred the War, and, in ways\nthat she knows so well, would have set about making a party for herself\namong the nations of the League. Who can be confident that she would\nhave failed either to divide her judges, or to accumulate such elements\nof strength that she might dare to defy them? A League of Nations would\nwork well only if its verdicts were loyally accepted by all the nations\ncomposing it. To make majority-rule possible you must have a community\nmade up of members who are reasonably well informed upon one another’s\naffairs, and who are bound together by a tie of loyalty stronger and\nmore enduring than their causes of difference. It would be a happy thing\nif the nations of the world made such a community; and the sufferings of\nthis War have brought them nearer to desiring it. But those who believe\nthat such a community can be formed to-day or to-morrow are too\nsanguine. It must not be forgotten that the very principle of the\nLeague, if its judgements are to take effect, involves a world-war in\ncases where a strong minority resists those judgements. Every war would\nbecome a world-war. Perhaps this very fact would prevent wars, but it\ncannot be said that experience favours such a conclusion.\nThere is no escape for us by way of the Gospels. The Gospel precept to\nturn the other cheek to the aggressor was not addressed to a meeting of\ntrustees. Christianity has never shirked war, or even much disliked it.\nWhere the whole soul is set on things unseen, wounds and death become of\nless account. And if the Christians have not helped us to avoid war, how\nshould the pacifists be of use? Those of them whom I happen to know, or\nto have met, have shown themselves, in the relations of civil life, to\nbe irritable, self-willed, combative creatures, where the average\nsoldier is calm, unselfish, and placable. There is something incongruous\nand absurd in the pacifist of British descent. He has fighting in his\nblood, and when his creed, or his nervous sensibility to physical\nhorrors, denies him the use of fighting, his blood turns sour. He can\nargue, and object, and criticize, but he cannot lead. All that he can\noffer us in effect is eternal quarrels in place of occasional fights.\nNo one can do anything to prevent war who does not recognize its\nsplendour, for it is by its splendour that it keeps its hold on\nhumanity, and persists. The wickedest and most selfish war in the world\nis not fought by wicked and selfish soldiers. The spirit of man is\nimmense, and for an old memory, a pledged word, a sense of fellowship,\noffers this frail and complicated tissue of flesh and blood, which a pin\nor a grain of sand will disorder, to be the victim of all the atrocities\nthat the wit of man can compound out of fire and steel and poison. If\nthat spirit is to be changed, or directed into new courses, it must be\nby one who understands it, and approaches it reverently, with bared\nhead.\nThe best hope seems to me to lie in paying chief attention to the\nimprovement of war rather than to its abolition; to the decencies of the\ncraft; to the style rather than the matter. Style is often more\nimportant than matter, and this War would not have been so fierce or so\nprolonged if it had not become largely a war on a point of style, a war,\nthat is to say, to determine the question how war should be waged. If\nthe Germans had behaved humanely and considerately to the civil\npopulation of Belgium, if they had kept their solemn promise not to use\npoison-gas, if they had refrained from murder at sea, if their valour\nhad been accompanied by chivalry, the War might now have been ended,\nperhaps not in their disfavour, for it would not have been felt, as it\nnow is felt, that they must be defeated at no matter how great a cost,\nor civilization will perish.\nEven as things are, there have been some gains in the manner of\nconducting war, which, when future generations look back on them, will\nbe seen to be considerable. It is true that modern science has devised\nnew and appalling weapons. The invention of a new weapon in war always\narouses protest, but it does not usually, in the long run, make war more\ninhuman. There was a great outcry in Europe when the broadsword was\nsuperseded by the rapier, and a tall man of his hands could be spitted\nlike a cat or a rabbit by any dexterous little fellow with a trained\nwrist. There was a wave of indignation, which was a hundred years in\npassing, when musketry first came into use, and a man-at-arms of great\nprowess could be killed from behind a wall by one who would not have\ndared to meet him in open combat. But these changes did not, in effect,\nmake war crueller or more deadly. They gave more play to intelligence,\nand abolished the tyranny of the bully, who took the wall of every man\nhe met, and made himself a public nuisance. The introduction of\npoison-gas, which is a small thing compared with the invention of\nfire-arms, has given the chemist a place in the ranks of fighting-men.\nAnd if science has lent its aid to the destruction of life, it has spent\ngreater zeal and more prolonged effort on the saving of life. No\nprevious war will compare with this in care for the wounded and maimed.\nIn all countries, and on all fronts, an army of skilled workers devote\nthemselves to this single end. I believe that this quickening of the\nhuman conscience, for that is what it is, will prove to be the greatest\ngain of the War, and the greatest advance made in restraint of war. If\nthe nations come to recognize that their first duty, and their first\nresponsibility, is to those who give so much in their service, that\nrecognition will of itself do more than can be done by any conclave of\nstatesmen to discourage war. It was the monk Telemachus, according to\nthe old story, who stopped the gladiatorial games at Rome, and was\nstoned by the people. If war, in process of time, shall be abolished,\nor, failing that, shall be governed by the codes of humanity and\nchivalry, like a decent tournament; then the one sacrificial figure\nwhich will everywhere be honoured for the change will be the figure not\nof a priest or a politician, but of a hospital nurse.\nThe War and the Press\nA paper read to the Essay Society, Eton College, March 14, 1918.\nWhen you asked me to read or speak to you, I promised to speak about the\nWar. What I have to say is wholly orthodox, but it is none the worse for\nthat. Indeed, when I think how entirely the War possesses our thoughts\nand how entirely we are agreed concerning it, I seem to see a new\nmeaning in the creeds of the religions. These creeds grew up by general\nconsent, and no one who believed them grudged repeating them. In the\nface of an indifferent or hostile world the faithful found themselves\nobliged to define their belief, and to strengthen themselves by an\nunwearying and united profession of faith. It is the enemy who gives\nmeaning to a religious creed: without our creed we cannot win. So I am\nwilling to remind you of what you know, rather than to try to introduce\nyou to novelties.\nThe strength of the enemy lies in his creed; not in the lands that he\nhas ravished from his neighbours. If his creed does not prevail, his\nlands will not help him. Germany has taken lands from Belgium, Serbia,\nRoumania, Russia, and the rest, but unless her digestion is as strong as\nher appetite, she will fail to keep them. If she is to hold them in\npeace, the peoples who inhabit these lands must be either exterminated\nor converted to the German creed. Lands can be annexed by a successful\ncampaign; they can be permanently conquered only by the operations of\npeace. The people who survive will be a weakness to the German Empire\nunless they accept what they are offered, a share in the German creed.\nThat creed has not many natural attractions for the peoples on whom it\nis imposed by force. It is an intensely patriotic creed; it insists on\nracial supremacy, and on unity to be achieved by violence. Pleading and\npersuasion have little part in it except as instruments of deceit. There\nis no use in listening to what the Germans say; they do not believe it\nthemselves. What they say is for others; what they do is for themselves.\nWhile they are at war, language for them has only two uses–to conceal\ntheir thoughts, and to deceive their enemies.\nThe creed of Western civilization, for which they feel nothing but\ncontempt, and on which they will be broken, is not a simple thing, like\ntheirs. The words by which it is commonly expressed–democracy,\nparliamentarism, individual liberty, diversity, free development–are\npuzzling theoretic words, which make no instinctive appeal to the heart.\nNevertheless, we stand for growth as against order; and for life as\nagainst death. If Germany wins this war, her system will have to be\nbroken or to decay before growth can start again. Must we lose even a\nhundred years in shaking ourselves free from the paralysis of the German\nnightmare?\nThe Germans have shown themselves strong in their unity, and strong in\ntheir willingness to make great sacrifices to preserve that unity. No\none can deny nobility to the sacrifice made by the simple-minded German\nsoldier who dies fighting bravely for his people and his creed. His\nnarrowness is his strength, and makes unselfishness easier by saving his\nmind from question. ’This one thing you shall do’, his country says to\nhim, ’fight and die for your country, so that your country and your\npeople shall have lordship over other countries and other peoples. You\nare nothing; Germany is everything.’\nWe who live in this island love our country with at least as deep a\npassion; but a creed so simple as the German creed will never do for us.\nWe are patriotic, but our patriotism is often overlaid and confused by a\nwider thought and a wider sympathy than the Germans have ever known.\nMuch extravagant praise has lately been given to the German power of\nthinking, which produces the elaborate marvels of German organization.\nBut this thinking is slave-thinking, not master-thinking; it spends\nitself wholly on devising complicated means to achieve a very simple\nend. That is what makes the Germans so like the animals. Their wisdom is\nall cunning. I have had German friends, two or three, in the course of\nmy life, but none of them ever understood a word that I said if I tried\nto say what I thought. You could talk to them about food, and they\nresponded easily. It was all very restful and pleasant, like talking to\nan intelligent dog.\nIf each of the allied nations were devoted to the creed of nationalism,\nthe alliance could not endure. We depend for our strength on what we\nhold in common. The weakness of this wider creed is that it makes no\nsuch immediate and strong appeal to the natural instincts as is made by\nthe mother-country. It demands the habitual exercise of reason and\nimagination. Further, seeing that we are infinitely less tame and less\ndocile than the Germans, we depend for our strength on informing and\nconvincing our people, and on obtaining agreement among them. Questions\nwhich in Germany are discussed only in the gloomy Berlin head-quarters\nof the General Staff are discussed here in the newspapers. In the press,\neven under the censorship, we think aloud. It records our differences\nand debates our policy. You could not suppress these differences and\nthese debates without damaging our cause. There is no freedom worth\nhaving which does not, sooner or later, include the freedom to say what\nyou think.\nNo doubt we could, if necessary, carry on for a time without the press;\nand I agree with those newspaper writers who have been saying recently\nthat the importance of the press is monstrously exaggerated by some of\nits critics. The working-man, so far as I know him, does not depend for\nhis patriotism on the leader-writers of the newspapers. He takes even\nthe news with a very large grain of salt. ’So the papers say’, he\nremarks; ’it may be true or it may not.’ Yet the press has done good\nservice, and might do better, in putting the meaning of the War before\nour people and in holding them together. Freedom means that we must love\nour diversity well enough to be willing to unite to protect it. We must\ndie for our differences as cheerfully as the Germans die for their\npattern. Or, if we can sketch a design of our cause, we must be as\npassionate in defence of that large vague design as the Germans are\npassionate in defence of their tight uniformity and their drill. If we\nwere to fail to keep together, our cause, I believe, would still\nprevail, but at a cost that we dare not contemplate, by way of anarchy,\nand the dissolution of societies, by long tortures, and tears, and\nmartyrdoms. If we refuse to die in the ranks against the German tyranny\nwe can keep our faith by dying at the stake. There are those who think\nmartyrdom the better way; and certainly that was how Christianity\nprevailed in Europe; you can read the story in Caxton’s translation of\nthe Golden Legend. But these saints and martyrs were making a\nbeginning; we are fighting to keep what we have won, and it would be a\nhuge failure on our part if we could keep nothing of it, but had to\nbegin all over again.\nThe business of the press, then, at this present crisis, is to keep the\ncause for which we are fighting clearly before us, and this it has done\nwell; also, because we do not fight best in blinders, to tell us all\nthat can be known of the facts of the situation, and this it has done\nnot so well.\nThe power of the newspapers is that most people read them, and that many\npeople read nothing else. Their weakness is that they have to sell or\ncease to be, so that by a natural instinct of self-preservation they\nfall back on the two sure methods whereby you can always capture the\nattention of the public. Any man who is trying to say what he thinks,\nmaking full allowance for all doubts and differences, runs the risk of\nlosing his audience. He can regain their attention by flattering them or\nby frightening them. Flattery and fright, the one following the other\nfrom day to day, and often from paragraph to paragraph, is a very large\npart of the newspaper reader’s diet. If he is a sane and busy man, he is\nnot too much impressed by either. He is not mercurial enough for the\nquick changes of an orator’s or journalist’s fancy, whereby he is called\non, one day, to dig the German warships like rats out of their harbour,\nand, not many days later, to spend his last shilling on the purchase of\nthe last bullet to shoot at the German invader. He knows that this is\nsuch stuff as dreams are made of. He knows also that the orator or\njournalist, after calling on him for these achievements, goes home to\ndinner. No great harm is done, just as no great harm is done by bad\nnovels. But an opportunity is lost; the press and the platform might do\nmore than they do to strengthen us and inform us, and help forward our\ncause.\nI name the press and the platform together because they are essentially\nthe same thing. Journalism is a kind of talk. The press, it is fair to\nsay, is ourselves; and every people, it may truly be said, has the press\nthat it deserves. But reading is a thing that we do chiefly for\nindulgence and pleasure in our idle time; and the press falls in with\nour mood, and supplies us with what we want in our weaker and lazier\nmoments. No responsible man, with an eager and active mind, spends much\nof his time on the newspapers. Those who are excited to action by what\nthey read in the papers are mostly content with the mild exercise of\nwriting to these same papers to explain that some one else ought to do\nsomething and to do it at once. Their excitement worries themselves more\nthan it hurts others. When the devil, with horns and hooves, appeared to\nCuvier, the naturalist, and threatened to devour him, Cuvier, who was\nasleep at the time, opened his eyes and looked at the terrible\napparition. ’Hm,’ he said, ’cloven-footed; graminivorous; needn’t be\nafraid of you;’ and he went to sleep again. A man who says that he has\nnot time to read the morning papers carefully is commonly a man who\ncounts; he knows what he has to do, and he goes on doing it. So far as I\nhave observed, the cadets who are training for command in the army take\nvery little interest in the exhortations of the newspapers. They even\nprefer the miserable trickle which is all that is left of football news.\nOne of the chief problems connected with the press is therefore\nthis–how can it be prevented from producing hysteria in the\nfeeble-minded? In time of war the censorship no doubt does something to\nprevent this; and I think it might do more. ’Scare-lines’, as they are\ncalled–that is, sensational headings in large capital letters–might be\nreduced by law to modest dimensions. More important, the censorship\nmight insist that all who write shall sign their names to their\narticles. Why should journalists alone be relieved of responsibility to\ntheir country? Is it possible that the Government is afraid of the\npress? There is no need for fear. ’Beware of Aristophanes’, says Landor,\n’he can cast your name as a byword to a thousand cities of Asia for a\nthousand years. But all that the press can do by its disfavour is to\nkeep your name obscure in a hundred cities of England for a hundred\ndays. Signed articles are robbed of their vague impressiveness, and are\nknown for what they are–the opinions of one man. I would also recommend\nthat a photograph of the author be placed at the head of every article.\nI have been saved from many bad novels by the helpful pictorial\nadvertisements of modern publishers.\nThe real work of the Press, as I said, is to help to hold the people\ntogether. Nothing else that it can do is of any importance compared with\nthis. We are at one in this War as we have never been at one before\nwithin living memory, as we were not at one against Napoleon or against\nLouis XIV. Our trial is on us; and if we cannot preserve our oneness, we\nfail. What would be left to us I do not know; but I am sure that an\nEngland which had accepted conditions of peace at Germany’s hands would\nnot be the England that any of us know. There might still be a few\nEnglishmen, but they would have to look about for somewhere to live.\nSerbia would be a good place; it has made no peace-treaty with Germany.\nWe are profoundly at one; and are divided only by illusions, which the\npress, in times past, has done much to keep alive. One of these\nillusions is the illusion of party. I have never been behind the scenes,\namong the creaking machinery, but my impression, as a spectator, is that\nparties in England are made very much as you pick up sides for a game. I\nhave observed that they are all conservative. The affections are\nconservative; every one has a liking for his old habits and his old\nassociates. There is something comic in a well-nourished rich man who\nbelieves that he is a bold reformer and a destructive thinker. For real\nclotted reactionary sentiment I know nothing to match the table-talk of\nany aged parliamentary Radical. When we get a Labour Government, it will\nbe patriotic, prejudiced, opposed to all innovation, superstitiously\nreverential of the past, sticky and, probably, tyrannical.\nThe party illusion has been much weakened by the War, and those who\nstill repeat the old catch-words are very near to lunacy. There is a\ndeeper and more dangerous illusion which has not been killed–the class\nillusion. We are all very much alike; but we live in water-tight\ncompartments called classes, and the inhabitants of each compartment\ntend to believe that they alone are patriotic. This illusion, to be\njust, is not fostered chiefly by the press, which wants to sell its work\nto all classes; but it has strong hold of the Government office. The\nGovernment does not know the people, except as an actor knows the\naudience; and therefore does not trust the people. It is pathetic to\nhear officials talking timidly of the people–will they endure hardships\nand sacrifices, will they carry through? Yet most of the successes we\nhave won in the War have to be credited not so much to the skill of the\nmanagement as to the amazing high courage of the ordinary soldier and\nsailor. Even soldiers are often subject to class illusion. I remember\nlistening, in the first month of the War, to a retired colonel, who\nexplained, with some heat, that the territorials could never be of any\nuse. That illusion has gone. Then it was Kitchener’s army–well-meaning\npeople, no doubt, but impossible for a European war. Kitchener’s army\nmade good. Now it is the civil population, who, though they are the\nblood relatives of the soldiers, are distrusted, and believed to be\nlikely to fail under a strain. Yet all the time, if you want to hear\nhalf-hearted, timid, pusillanimous talk, the place where you are most\nlikely to hear it is in the public offices. Most of those who talk in\nthis way would be brave enough in fight, but they are kept at desks, and\nworried with detailed business, and harassed by speculative dangers, and\nthey lose perspective. Soon or late, we are going to win this War; and\nit is the people who are going to win it.\nIf the press (or perhaps the Government, which controls the press) is\nnot afraid of the people, why does it tell them so little about our\nreverses, and the merits of our enemies? For information concerning\nthese things we have to depend wholly on conversation with returned\nsoldiers. For instance, the horrible stories that we hear of the brutal\ntreatment of our prisoners are numerous, and are true, and make a heavy\nbill against Germany, which bill we mean to present. But are they fair\nexamples of the average treatment? We cannot tell; the accounts\npublished are almost exclusively confined to the worst happenings. Most\nof the officers with whom I have talked who had been in several German\nmilitary prisons said that they had nothing serious to complain of.\nPrison is not a good place, and it is not pleasant to have your\npea-soup and your coffee, one after the other, in the same tin dipper;\nbut they were soldiers, and they agreed that it would be absurd to make\na grievance of things like that. One private soldier was an even greater\nphilosopher. ’No’, he said, ’I have nothing to complain of. Of course,\nthey do spit at you a good deal.’ That man was unconquerable.\nIn shipping returns and the like we are given averages; why are we told\nnothing at all of the milder experiences of our soldier prisoners? It\nwould not make us less resolved to do all that we can to better the lot\nof those who are suffering insult and torture, and to exact full\nretribution from the enemy. And it would bring some hope to those whose\nhusbands or children or friends are in German military prisons, and who\nare racked every day by tales of what, in fact, are exceptional\natrocities.\nOr take the question of the conduct of German officers. We know that the\nPrussian military Government, in its approved handbooks, teaches its\nofficers the use of brutality and terror as military weapons. The German\nphilosophy of war, of which this is a part, is not really a philosophy\nof war; it is a philosophy of victory. For a long time now the Germans\nhave been accustomed to victory, and have studied the arts of breaking\nthe spirit and torturing the mind of the peoples whom they invade. Their\nphilosophy of war will have to be rewritten when the time comes for them\nto accommodate their doctrine to their own defeat. In the meantime they\nteach frightfulness to their officers, and most of their officers prove\nready pupils. There must be some, one would think, here and there, if\nonly a sprinkling, who fall short of the Prussian doctrine, and are\nbetrayed by human feeling into what we should recognize as decent and\nhonourable conduct. And so there are; only we do not hear of them\nthrough the press. I should like to tell two stories which come to me\nfrom personal sources. The first may be called the story of the\nChristmas truce and the German captain. In the lull which fell on the\nfighting at the time of the first Christmas of the War, a British\nofficer was disquieted to notice that his men were fraternizing with the\nGermans, who were standing about with them in No-man’s land, laughing\nand talking. He went out to them at once, to bring them back to their\nown trenches. When he came up to his men, he met a German captain who\nhad arrived on the same errand. The two officers, British and German,\nfell into talk, and while they were standing together, in not unfriendly\nfashion, one of the men took a snapshot photograph of them, copies of\nwhich were afterwards circulated in the trenches. Then the men were\nrecalled to their duty, on the one side and the other, and, after an\ninterval of some days, the war began again. A little time after this the\nBritish officer was in charge of a patrol, and, having lost his way,\nfound himself in the German trenches, where he and his men were\nsurrounded and captured. As they were being marched off along the\ntrenches, they met the German captain, who ordered the men to be taken\nto the rear, and then, addressing the officer without any sign of\nrecognition, said in a loud voice, ’You, follow me!’ He led him by\ncomplicated ways along a whole series of trenches and up a sap, at the\nend of which he stopped, saluted, and, pointing with his hand, said\n’Your trenches are there. Good day.’\nMy second story, the story of the British lieutenant in No-man’s land,\nis briefer. I was with a friend of mine, a young officer back from the\nfront, wounded, and the conduct of German officers was being discussed.\nHe said, ’You can’t expect me to be very hard on German officers, for\none of them saved my life’. He then told how he and a companion crept\nout into No-man’s land to bring in some of our wounded who were lying\nthere. When they had reached the wounded, and were preparing to bring\nthem in, they were discovered by the Germans opposite, who at once\nwhipped up a machine-gun and turned it on them. Their lives were not\nworth half a minute’s purchase, when suddenly a German officer leapt up\non to the parapet, and, angrily waving back the machine-gunners, called\nout, in English, ’That’s all right. You may take them in.’\nThese are no doubt exceptional cases; the rule is very different. But a\ngood many of such cases are known to soldiers, and I have seen none of\nthem in the press. Soldiers are silent by law, and journalists either do\nnot hear these things, or, believing that hate is a valuable asset,\nsuppress all mention of them. If England could ever be disgraced by a\nmishap, she would be disgraced by having given birth to those\nEnglishmen, few and wretched, who, when an enemy behaves generously,\nconceal or deny the fact. And consider the effect of this silence on the\nGermans. There are some German officers, as I said, who are better than\nthe German military handbooks, and better than their monstrous chiefs.\nWhich of them will pay the smallest attention to what our papers say\nwhen he finds that they collect only atrocities, and are blind to\nhumanity if they see it in an enemy? He will regard our press accounts\nof the German army as the work of malicious cripples; and our perfectly\ntrue narrative of the unspeakable brutality and filthiness of the German\narmy’s doings will lose credit with him.\nIf I had my way, I would staff the newspaper offices, as far as\npossible, with wounded soldiers, and I would give some of the present\nstaff a holiday as stretcher-bearers. Then we should hear more of the\ntruth.\nIs it feared that we should have no heart for the War if once we are\nconvinced that among the Germans there are some human beings? Is it\nbelieved that our people can be heroic on one condition only, that they\nshall be asked to fight no one but orangoutangs? Our airmen fight as\nwell as any one, in this world or above it, has ever fought; and we owe\nthem a great debt of thanks for maintaining, and, by their example,\nactually teaching the Germans to maintain, a high standard of decency.\nThis War has shown, what we might have gathered from our history, that\nwe fight best up hill. From our history also we may learn that it does\nnot relax our sinews to be told that our enemy has some good qualities.\nWe should like him better as an enemy if he had more. We know what we\nhave believed; and we are not going to fail in resolve or perseverance\nbecause we find that our task is difficult, and that we have not a\nmonopoly of all the virtues.\nMost of us will not live to see it, for our recovery from this disease\nwill be long and troublesome, but the War will do great things for us.\nIt will make a reality of the British Commonwealth, which until now has\nbeen only an aspiration and a dream. It will lay the sure foundation of\na League of Nations in the affection and understanding which it has\npromoted among all English-speaking peoples, and in the relations of\nmutual respect and mutual service which it has established between the\nEnglish-speaking peoples and the Latin races. Our united Rolls of Honour\nmake the most magnificent list of benefactors that the world has ever\nseen. In the end, the War may perhaps even save the soul of the main\ncriminal, awaken him from his bloody dream, and lead him back by degrees\nto the possibility of innocence and goodwill.\nShakespeare and England\nAnnual Shakespeare Lecture of the British Academy, delivered July 4,\n1918\nThere is nothing new and important to be said of Shakespeare. In recent\nyears antiquaries have made some additions to our knowledge of the facts\nof his life. These additions are all tantalizing and comparatively\ninsignificant. The history of the publication of his works has also\nbecome clearer and more intelligible, especially by the labours of Mr.\nPollard; but the whole question of quartos and folios remains thorny and\ndifficult, so that no one can reach any definite conclusion in this\nmatter without a liberal use of conjecture.\nI propose to return to the old catholic doctrine which has been\nilluminated by so many disciples of Shakespeare, and to speak of him as\nour great national poet. He embodies and exemplifies all the virtues,\nand most of the faults, of England. Any one who reads and understands\nhim understands England. This method of studying Shakespeare by reading\nhim has perhaps gone somewhat out of vogue in favour of more roundabout\nways of approach, but it is the best method for all that. Shakespeare\ntells us more about himself and his mind than we could learn even from\nthose who knew him in his habit as he lived, if they were all alive and\nall talking. To learn what he tells we have only to listen.\nI think there is no national poet, of any great nation whatsoever, who\nis so completely representative of his own people as Shakespeare is\nrepresentative of the English. There is certainly no other English poet\nwho comes near to Shakespeare in embodying our character and our\nfoibles. No one, in this connexion, would venture even to mention\nSpenser or Milton. Chaucer is English, but he lived at a time when\nEngland was not yet completely English, so that he is only\nhalf-conscious of his nation. Wordsworth is English, but he was a\nrecluse. Browning is English, but he lived apart or abroad, and was a\ntourist of genius. The most English of all our great men of letters,\nnext to Shakespeare, is certainly Dr. Johnson, but he was no great poet.\nShakespeare, it may be suspected, is too poetic to be a perfect\nEnglishman; but his works refute that suspicion. He is the Englishman\nendowed, by a fortunate chance, with matchless powers of expression. He\nis not silent or dull; but he understands silent men, and he enters into\nthe minds of dull men. Moreover, the Englishman seems duller than he is.\nIt is a point of pride with him not to be witty and not to give voice to\nhis feelings. The shepherd Corin, who was never in court, has the true\nphilosophy. ’He that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain\nof good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.’\nShakespeare knew nothing of the British Empire. He was an islander, and\nhis patriotism was centred on\n     This precious stone set in the silver sea,\n     Which serves it in the office of a wall,\n     Or as a moat defensive to a house,\n     Against the envy of less happier lands.\nWhen he speaks of Britons and British he always means the Celtic\npeoples of the island. Once only he makes a slip. There is a passage in\nKing Lear (IV. vi. 249) where the followers of the King, who in the\ntext of the quarto versions are correctly called ’the British party’,\nappear in the folio version as ’the English party’. Perhaps the quartos\ncontain Shakespeare’s own correction of his own inadvertence; but those\nof us, and we are many, who have been blamed by northern patriots for\nthe misuse of the word English may claim Shakespeare as a brother in\nmisfortune.\nOur critics, at home and abroad, accuse us of arrogance. I doubt if we\ncan prove them wrong; but they do not always understand the nature of\nEnglish arrogance. It does not commonly take the form of self-assertion.\nShakespeare’s casual allusions to our national characteristics are\nalmost all of a kind; they are humorous and depreciatory. Here are some\nof them. Every holiday fool in England, we learn from Trinculo in The\nTempest, would give a piece of silver to see a strange fish, though no\none will give a doit to relieve a lame beggar. The English are\nquarrelsome, Master Slender testifies, at the game of bear-baiting. They\nare great drinkers, says Iago, ’most potent in potting; your Dane, your\nGerman, and your swag-bellied Hollander are nothing to your English’.\nThey are epicures, says Macbeth. They will eat like wolves and fight\nlike devils, says the Constable of France. An English nobleman,\naccording to the Lady of Belmont, can speak no language but his own. An\nEnglish tailor, according to the porter of Macbeth’s castle, will steal\ncloth where there is hardly any cloth to be stolen, out of a French\nhose. The devil, says the clown in All’s Well, has an English name; he\nis called the Black Prince.\nNothing has been changed in this vein of humorous banter since\nShakespeare died. One of the best pieces of Shakespeare criticism ever\nwritten is contained in four words of the present Poet Laureate’s Ode\nfor the Tercentenary of Shakespeare, ’London’s laughter is thine’. The\nwit of our trenches in this war, especially perhaps among the Cockney\nand South country regiments, is pure Shakespeare. Falstaff would find\nhimself at home there, and would recognize a brother in Old Bill.\nThe best known of Shakespeare’s allusions to England are no doubt those\nsplendid outbursts of patriotism which occur in King John, and\nRichard II, and Henry V. And of these the dying speech of John of\nGaunt, in Richard II, is the deepest in feeling. It is a lament upon\nthe decay of England, ’this dear, dear land’. Since we began to be a\nnation we have always lamented our decay. I am afraid that the Germans,\nwhose self-esteem takes another form, were deceived by this. To the\nright English temper all bragging is a thing of evil omen. That temper\nis well expressed, where perhaps you would least expect to find it, in\nthe speech of King Henry V to the French herald:\n                           To say the sooth,–\n  Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much\n  Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,–\n  My people are with sickness much enfeebled,\n  My numbers lessened, and those few I have\n  Almost no better than so many French;\n  Who, when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,\n  I thought upon one pair of English legs\n  Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,\n  That I do brag thus! This your air of France\n  Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.\n  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am:\n  My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk;\n  My army but a weak and sickly guard;\n  Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,\n  Though France himself and such another neighbour\n  Stand in our way. There’s for thy labour, Montjoy.\n  Go bid thy master well advise himself:\n  If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,\n  We shall your tawny ground with your red blood\n  Discolour; and so, Montjoy, fare you well.\n  The sum of all our answer is but this:\n  We would not seek a battle as we are;\n  Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it;\n  So tell your master.\nThat speech might have been written for the war which we are waging\nto-day against a less honourable enemy. But, indeed, Shakespeare is full\nof prophecy. Here is his description of the volunteers who flocked to\nthe colours in the early days of the war:\n  Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries,\n  With ladies’ faces and fierce dragons’ spleens,\n  Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,\n  Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,\n  To make a hazard of new fortunes here.\n  In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits\n  Than now the English bottoms have waft o’er\n  Did never float upon the swelling tide.\nAnd here is his sermon on national unity, preached by the Bishop of\nCarlisle:\n  O, if you rear this house against this house,\n  It will the woefullest division prove\n  That ever fell upon this cursed earth.\n  Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,\n  Lest child, child’s children, cry against you ’Woe!’\nThe Patriotism of the Women Is Described By the Bastard in king John:\n  Your own ladies and pale-visag’d maids\n  Like Amazons come tripping after drums:\n  Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,\n  Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts\n  To fierce and bloody inclination.\nLastly, Queen Isabella’s blessing, spoken over King Henry V and his\nFrench bride, predicts an enduring friendship between England and\nFrance:\n  As man and wife, being two, are one in love,\n  So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,\n  That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,\n  Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,\n  Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,\n  To make divorce of their incorporate league;\n  That English may as French, French Englishmen,\n  Receive each other! God speak this Amen!\nOne of the delights of a literature as rich and as old as ours is that\nat every step we take backwards we find ourselves again. We are\ndelivered from that foolish vein of thought, so dear to ignorant\nconceit, which degrades the past in order to exalt the present and the\nfuture. It is easy to feel ourselves superior to men who no longer\nbreathe and walk, and whom we do not trouble to understand. Here is the\nreal benefit of scholarship; it reduces men to kinship with their race.\nScience, pressing forward, and beating against the bars which guard the\nsecrets of the future, has no such sympathy in its gift.\nAnyhow, in Shakespeare’s time, England was already old England; which if\nshe could ever cease to be, she might be Jerusalem, or Paradise, but\nwould not be England at all. What Shakespeare and his fellows of the\nsixteenth century gave her was a new self-consciousness and a new\nself-confidence. They foraged in the past; they recognized themselves in\ntheir ancestors; they found feudal England, which had existed for many\nhundreds of years, a dumb thing; and when she did not know her own\nmeaning, they endowed her purposes with words. They gave her a new\ndelight in herself, a new sense of power and exhilaration, which has\nremained with her to this day, surviving all the airy philosophic\ntheories of humanity which thought to supersede the old solid national\ntemper. The English national temper is better fitted for traffic with\nthe world than any mere doctrine can ever be, for it is marked by an\nimmense tolerance. And this, too, Shakespeare has expressed. Falstaff is\nperhaps the most tolerant man who was ever made in God’s image. But it\nis rather late in the day to introduce Falstaff to an English audience.\nPerhaps you will let me modernize a brief scene from Shakespeare,\naltering nothing essential, to illustrate how completely his spirit is\nthe spirit of our troops in Flanders and France.\nA small British expeditionary force, bound on an international mission,\nfinds itself stranded in an unknown country. The force is composed of\nmen very various in rank and profession. Two of them, whom we may call\na non-commissioned officer and a private, go exploring by themselves,\nand take one of the natives of the place prisoner. This native is an\nugly low-born creature, of great physical strength and violent criminal\ntendencies, a liar, and ready at any time for theft, rape, and murder.\nHe is a child of Nature, a lover of music, slavish in his devotion to\npower and rank, and very easily imposed upon by authority. His captors\ndo not fear him, and, which is more, they do not dislike him. They found\nhim lying out in a kind of no-man’s land, drenched to the skin, so they\ndetermine to keep him as a souvenir, and to take him home with them.\nThey nickname him, in friendly fashion, the monster, and the mooncalf,\nas who should say Fritz, or the Boche. But their first care is to give\nhim a drink, and to make him swear allegiance upon the bottle. ’Where\nthe devil should he learn our language?’ says the non-commissioned\nofficer, when the monster speaks. ’I will give him some relief, if it be\nbut for that.’ The prisoner then offers to kiss the foot of his captor.\n’I shall laugh myself to death’, says the private, ’at this puppy-headed\nmonster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,\nbut that the poor monster’s in drink.’ When the private continues to\nrail at the monster, his officer calls him to order. ’Trinculo, keep a\ngood tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer, the next tree–––\nThe poor monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.’\nIn this scene from The Tempest, everything is English except the\nnames. The incident has been repeated many times in the last four years.\n’This is Bill,’ one private said, introducing a German soldier to his\ncompany. ’He’s my prisoner. I wounded him, and I took him, and where I\ngo he goes. Come on, Bill, old man.’ The Germans have known many\nfailures since they began the War, but one failure is more tragic than\nall the rest. They love to be impressive, to produce a panic of\napprehension and a thrill of reverence in their enemy; and they have\ncompletely failed to impress the ordinary British private. He remains\nincurably humorous, and so little moved to passion that his daily\noffices of kindness are hardly interrupted.\nShakespeare’s tolerance, which is no greater than the tolerance of the\ncommon English soldier, may be well seen in his treatment of his\nvillains. Is a liar, or a thief, merely a bad man? Shakespeare does not\nmuch encourage you to think so. Is a murderer a bad man? He would be an\nundiscerning critic who should accept that phrase as a true and adequate\ndescription of Macbeth. Shakespeare does not dislike liars, thieves, and\nmurderers as such, and he does not pretend to dislike them. He has his\nown dislikes. I once asked a friend of mine, long since dead, who\nrefused to condemn almost anything, whether there were any vices that he\ncould not find it in his heart to tolerate. He replied at once that\nthere were two–cruelty, and bilking; which, if the word is not\nacademic, I may paraphrase as cheating the helpless, swindling a child\nout of its pennies, or leaving a house by the back door in order to\navoid paying your cabman his lawful fare. These exclusions from mercy\nShakespeare would accept; and I think he would add a third. His worst\nvillains are all theorists, who cheat and murder by the book of\narithmetic. They are men of principle, and are ready to expound their\nprinciple and to defend it in argument. They follow it, without remorse\nor mitigation, wherever it leads them. It is Iago’s logic that makes him\nso terrible; his mind is as cold as a snake and as hard as a surgeon’s\nknife. The Italian Renaissance did produce some such men; the modern\nGerman imitation is a grosser and feebler thing, brutality trying to\nemulate the glitter and flourish of refined cruelty.\nWith his wonderful quickness of intuition and his unsurpassed subtlety\nof expression Shakespeare drew the characters of the Englishmen that he\nsaw around him. Why is it that he has given us no full-length portrait,\ncarefully drawn, of a hypocrite? It can hardly have been for lack of\nmodels. Outside England, not only among our enemies, but among our\nfriends and allies, it is agreed that hypocrisy is our national vice,\nour ruling passion. There must be some meaning in so widely held an\nopinion; and, on our side, there are damaging admissions by many\nwitnesses. The portrait gallery of Charles Dickens is crowded with\nhypocrites. Some of them are greasy and servile, like Mr. Pumblechook or\nUriah Heep; others rise to poetic heights of daring, like Mr. Chadband\nor Mr. Squeers. But Shakespeare’s hypocrites enjoy themselves too much;\nthey are artists to the finger-tips. It may be said, no doubt, that\nShakespeare lived before organized religious dissent had developed a new\ntype of character among the weaker brethren. But the Low Church\nProtestant, whom Shakespeare certainly knew, is not very different from\nthe evangelical dissenter of later days; and he did not interest\nShakespeare.\nMy own impression is that Shakespeare had a free and happy childhood,\nand grew up without much check from his elders. It is the child who sees\nhypocrites. These preposterous grown-up people, who, if they are\nwell-mannered, do not seem to enjoy their food, who are fussy about\nmeaningless employments, and never give way to natural impulses, must\nsurely assume this veil of decorum with intent to deceive. Charles\nDickens was hard driven in his childhood, and the impressions that were\nthen burnt into him governed all his seeing. The creative spirit in him\ntransformed his sufferings into delight; but he never outgrew them; and,\nwhen he died, the eyes of a child were closed upon a scene touched, it\nis true, here and there with rapturous pleasure, rich in oddity, and\ntrembling with pathos, but, in the main, as bleak and unsatisfying as\nthe wards of a workhouse. The intense emotions of his childhood made the\nusual fervours of adolescence a faint thing in the comparison, and if\nyou want to know how lovers think and feel you do not go to Dickens to\ntell you. You go to Shakespeare, who put his childhood behind him, so\nthat he almost forgot it, and ran forward to seize life with both hands.\nHe sometimes looked back on children, and saw them through the eyes of\ntheir elders. Dickens saw men and women as they appear to children.\nThis comparison suggests a certain lack of sympathy or lack of\nunderstanding in those who are quick to see hypocrisy in others. In\nDickens lack of sympathy was a fair revenge; moreover, his hypocrites\namused him so much that he did not wish to understand them. What a loss\nit would have been to the world if he had explained them away! But it is\ndifficult, I think, to see a hypocrite in a man whose intimacy you have\ncultivated, whose mind you have entered into, as Shakespeare entered\ninto the mind of his creatures. Hypocrisy, in its ordinary forms, is a\nsuperficial thing–a skin disease, not a cancer. It is not easy, at\nbest, to bring the outward and inward relations of the soul into perfect\nharmony; a hypocrite is one who too readily consents to their\nseparation. The English, for I am ready now to return to my point, are a\npeople of a divided mind, slow to drive anything through on principle,\nvery ready to find reason in compromise. They are passionate, and they\nare idealists, but they are also a practical people, and they dare not\ngive the rein to a passion or an idea. They know that in this world an\nunmitigated principle simply will not work; that a clean cut will never\ntake you through the maze. So they restrain themselves, and listen, and\nseem patient. They are not so patient as they seem; they must be\nhypocrites! A cruder, simpler people like the Germans feel indignation,\nnot unmixed perhaps with envy, when they hear the quiet voice and see\nthe white lips of the thoroughbred Englishman who is angry. It is not\nmanly or honest, they think, to be angry without getting red in the\nface. They certainly feel pride in their own honesty when they give\nexplosive vent to their emotions. They have not learned the elements of\nself-distrust. The Englishman is seldom quite content to be himself;\noften his thoughts are troubled by something better. He suffers from the\ndivided mind; and earns the reputation of a hypocrite. But the simpler\nnature that indulges itself and believes in itself has an even heavier\npenalty to pay. If, in the name of honesty, you cease to distinguish\nbetween what you are and what you would wish to be, between how you act\nand how you would like to act, you are in some danger of reeling back\ninto the beast. It is true that man is an animal; and before long you\nfeel a glow of conscious virtue in proclaiming and illustrating that\ntruth. You scorn the hypocrisy of pretending to be better than you are,\nand that very scorn fixes you in what you are. ’He that is unjust, let\nhim be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still.’\nThat is the epitaph on German honesty. I have drifted away from\nShakespeare, who knew nothing of the sea of troubles that England would\none day take arms against, and who could not know that on that day she\nwould outgo his most splendid praise and more than vindicate his\nreverence and his affection. But Shakespeare is still so live a mind\nthat it is vain to try to expound him by selected texts, or to pin him\nto a mosaic of quotations from his book. Often, if you seek to know what\nhe thought on questions which must have exercised his imagination, you\ncan gather it only from a hint dropped by accident, and quite\nirrelevant. What were his views on literature, and on the literary\ncontroversies which have been agitated from his day to our own? He tells\nus very little. He must have heard discussions and arguments on metre,\non classical precedent, on the ancient and modern drama; but he makes no\nmention of these questions. He does not seem to have attached any\nprophetic importance to poetry. The poets who exalt their craft are of a\nmore slender build. Is it conceivable that he would have given his\nsupport to a literary academy,–a project which began to find advocates\nduring his lifetime? I think not. It is true that he is full of good\nsense, and that an academy exists to promulgate good sense. Moreover his\nown free experiments brought him nearer and nearer into conformity with\nclassical models. Othello and Macbeth are better constructed plays\nthan Hamlet. The only one of his plays which, whether by chance or by\ndesign, observes the so-called unities, of action and time and place, is\none of his latest plays–The Tempest. But he was an Englishman, and\nwould have been jealous of his freedom and independence. When the\ngrave-digger remarks that it is no great matter if Hamlet do not recover\nhis wits in England, because there the men are as mad as he, the satire\nhas a sympathetic ring in it. Shakespeare did not wish to see the mad\nEnglish altered. Nor are they likely to alter; our fears and our hopes\nare vain. We entered on the greatest of our wars with an army no bigger,\nso we are told, than the Bulgarian army. Since that time we have\nregimented and organized our people, not without success; and our\nsoothsayers are now directing our attention to the danger that after the\nwar we shall be kept in uniform and shall become tame creatures, losing\nour independence and our spirit of enterprise. There is nothing that\nsoothsayers will not predict when they are gravelled for lack of matter,\nbut this is the stupidest of all their efforts. The national character\nis not so flimsy a thing; it has gone through good and evil fortune for\nhundreds of years without turning a hair. You can make a soldier, and a\ngood soldier, of a humorist; but you cannot militarize him. He remains a\nfree thinker.\nNew institutions do not flourish in England. The town is a comparatively\nmodern innovation; it has never, so to say, caught on. Most schemes of\ntown-planning are schemes for pretending that you live in the country.\nThis is one of the most persistent of our many hypocrisies. Wherever\nworking people inhabit a street of continuous red-brick cottages, the\nnames that they give to their homes are one long catalogue of romantic\nlies. The houses have no gardens, and the only prospect that they\ncommand is the view of over the way. But read their names–The Dingle,\nThe Elms, Pine Grove, Windermere, The Nook, The Nest. Even social\npretence, which is said to be one of our weaknesses, and which may be\nread in such names as Belvoir or Apsley House, is less in evidence than\nthe Englishman’s passion for the country. He cannot bear to think that\nhe lives in a town. He does not much respect the institutions of a town.\nA policeman, before he has been long in the force, has to face the fact\nthat he is generally regarded as a comic character. The police are\nEnglishmen and good fellows, and they accept a situation which would\nrouse any continental gendarme to heroic indignation. Mayors, Aldermen,\nand Justices of the Peace are comic, and take it not quite so well.\nBeadles were so wholly dedicated to the purposes of comedy that I\nsuppose they found their position unendurable and went to earth; at any\nrate it is very difficult to catch one in his official costume.\nAll this is reflected in Shakespeare. He knew the country, and he knew\nthe town; and he has not left it in doubt which was the cherished home\nof his imagination. He preferred the fields to the streets, but the\nArcadia of his choice is not agricultural or even pastoral; it is rather\na desert island, or the uninhabited stretches of wild and woodland\ncountry. Indeed, he has both described it and named it. ’Where will the\nold Duke live?’ says Oliver in As You Like It. ’They say he is already\nin the forest of Arden,’ says Charles the wrestler, ’and a many merry\nmen with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England.\nThey say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\ncarelessly, as they did in the golden world.’ That is Shakespeare’s\nArcadia; and who that has read As You Like It will deny that it\nbreathes the air of Paradise?\nIt is quite plain that the freedom that Shakespeare valued was in fact\nfreedom, not any of those ingenious mechanisms to which that name has\nbeen applied by political theorists. He thought long and profoundly on\nthe problems of society; and anarchy has no place among his political\nideals. It is by all means to be avoided–at a cost. But what harm would\nanarchy do if it meant no more than freedom for all the impulses of the\nenlightened imagination and the tender heart? The ideals of his heart\nwere not political; and when he indulges himself, as he did in his\nlatest plays, you must look for him in the wilds; whether on the road\nnear the shepherd’s cottage, or in the cave among the mountains of\nWales, or on the seashore in the Bermudas. The laws that are imposed\nupon the intricate relations of men in society were a weariness to him;\nand in this he is thoroughly English. The Englishman has always been an\nobjector, and he has a right to object, though it may very well be held\nthat he is too fond of larding his objection with the plea of\nconscience. But even this has a meaning in our annals; as a mere\nquestion of right we are very slow to prefer the claim of the organized\nopinions of society to the claim of the individual conscience. We know\nthat there is no good in a man who is doing what he does not will to do.\nWe are not like our poets or our men of action to be void of\ninspiration. A gift is nothing if there is no benevolence in the giver:\n                    For to the noble mind\n  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\nWe ask for the impulse as well as the deed. Even when he is speaking of\nsocial obligations Shakespeare makes his strongest appeal not to force\nor command, but to the natural piety of the heart:\n  If ever you have looked on better days,\n  If ever been where bells have knolled to church,\n  If ever sat at any good man’s feast,\n  If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,\n  And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,\n  Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:\n  In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\nSo speaks Orlando when the Duke has met his threats with fair words;\nand he adds an apology:\n                 Pardon me, I pray you;\n  I thought that all things had been savage here,\n  And therefore put I on the countenance\n  Of stern commandment.\nThe ultimate law between man and man, according to Shakespeare, is the\nlaw of pity. I suppose that most of us have had our ears so dulled by\nearly familiarity with Portia’s famous speech, which we probably knew by\nheart long before we were fit to understand it, that the heavenly\nquality of it, equal to almost anything in the New Testament, is\nobscured and lost. There is no remedy but to read it again; to remember\nthat it was conceived in passion; and to notice how the meaning is\nraised and perfected as line follows line:\n  portia.  Then Must the Jew Be Merciful.\n Shylock. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\n  Portia. The quality of mercy is not strained.\n  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\n  Upon the place beneath; it is twice bless’d;\n  It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:\n  ’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\n  The throned monarch better than his crown.\n  His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\n  The attribute to awe and majesty,\n  Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\n  But mercy is above this sceptred sway,\n  It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\n  It is an attribute to God himself,\n  And earthly power doth then show likest God’s\n  When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\n  Though justice be thy plea, consider this,\n  That in the course of justice none of us\n  Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy,\n  And that same prayer doth teach us all to render\n  The deeds of mercy.\nThat speech rises above the strife of nations; it belongs to humanity.\nBut an Englishman wrote it; and the author, we may be sure, if he ever\nmet with the doctrine that a man who is called on to help his own people\nis in duty bound to set aside the claims of humanity, and to stop his\nears to the call of mercy, knew that the doctrine is an invention of the\ndevil, stupid and angry, as the devil commonly is. There are hundreds of\nthousands of Englishmen who, though they could not have written the\nspeech, yet know all that it teaches, and act on the knowledge. It is\npart of the creed of the Navy. We can speak more confidently than we\ncould have spoken three or four years ago. We know that not the\nextremest pressure of circumstance could ever bring the people of\nEngland to forget all the natural pieties, to permit official duties to\nannul private charities, and to join in the frenzied dance of hate and\nlust which leads to the mouth of the pit.\nYet Germany, where all this seems to have happened, was not very long\nago a country where it was easy to find humanity, and simplicity, and\nkindness. It was a country of quiet industry and content, the home of\nfairy stories, which Shakespeare himself would have loved. The Germans\nof our day have made a religion of war and terror, and have used\ncommerce as a means for the treacherous destruction of the independence\nand freedom of others. They were not always like that. In the fifteenth\ncentury they spread the art of printing through Europe, for the service\nof man, by the method of peaceful penetration. My friend Mr. John\nSampson recently expressed to me a hope that our air-forces would not\nbomb Mainz, ’for Mainz’, he said, ’is a sacred place to the\nbibliographer’. According to a statement published in Cologne in 1499,\n’the highly valuable art of printing was invented first of all in\nGermany at Mainz on the Rhine. And it is a great honour to the German\nnation that such ingenious men are to be found among them....And in the\nyear of our Lord 1450 it was a golden year, and they began to print, and\nthe first book they printed was the Bible in Latin: it was printed in a\nlarge character, resembling the types with which the present mass-books\nare printed.’ Gutenberg, the printer of this Bible, never mentions his\nown name, and the only personal note we have of his, in the colophon of\nthe Catholicon, printed in 1460, is a hymn in praise of his city:\n’With the aid of the Most High, who unlooses the tongues of infants and\noft-times reveals to babes that which is hidden from learned men, this\nadmirable book, the Catholicon, was finished in the year of the\nincarnation of our Saviour MCCCCLX, in the foster town of Mainz, a town\nof the famous German nation, which God in his clemency, by granting to\nit this high illumination of the mind, has preferred before the other\nnations of the world.’\nThere is something not quite unlike modern Germany in that; and yet\nthese older activities of the Germans make a strange contrast with their\nwork to-day. It was in the city of Cologne that Caxton first made\nacquaintance with his craft. Everywhere the Germans spread printing like\na new religion, adapting it to existing conditions. In Bavaria they used\nthe skill of the wood-engravers, and at Augsburg, Ulm, and Nuremberg\nproduced the first illustrated printed books. It was two Germans of the\nold school, Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz, who carried the art to\nItaly, casting the first type in Roman characters, and printing editions\nof the classics, first in the Benedictine monastery of St. Scholastica\nat Subiaco, and later at Rome. They also cast the first Greek type. It\nwas three Germans, Gering, Kranz, and Freyburger, who first printed at\nParis, in 1470. It was a German who set up the first printing-press in\nSpain, in 1474. The Germans were once the cherishers, as now they are\nthe destroyers, of the inheritance of civilization. I do not pretend to\nexplain the change. Perhaps it is a tragedy of education. That is a\ndangerous moment in the life of a child when he begins to be uneasily\naware that he is valued for his simplicity and innocence. Then he\nresolves to break with the past, to put away childish things, to forgo\naffection, and to earn respect by imitating the activities of his\nelders. The strange power of words and the virtues of abstract thought\nbegin to fascinate him. He loses touch with the things of sense, and\nceases to speak as a child. If his first attempts at argument and dogma\nwin him praise and esteem, if he proves himself a better fighter than an\nolder boy next door, who has often bullied him, and if at the same time\nhe comes into money, he is on the road to ruin. His very simplicity is a\nsnare to him. ’What a fool I was’, he thinks, ’to let myself be put\nupon; I now see that I am a great philosopher and a splendid soldier,\nborn to subdue others rather than to agree with them, and entitled to a\nchief share in all the luxuries of the world. It is for me to say what\nis good and true, and if any of these people contradict me I shall knock\nthem down.’ He suits his behaviour to his new conception of himself, and\nis soon hated by all the neighbours. Then he turns bitter. These people,\nhe thinks, are all in a plot against him. They must be blind to goodness\nand beauty, or why do they dislike him! His rage reaches the point of\nmadness; he stabs and poisons the villagers, and burns down their\nhouses. We are still waiting to see what will become of him.\nThis outbreak has been long preparing. Seventy years before the War the\nGerman poet Freiligrath wrote a poem to prove that Germany is Hamlet,\nurged by the spirit of her fathers to claim her inheritance, vacillating\nand lost in thought, but destined, before the Fifth Act ends, to strew\nthe stage with the corpses of her enemies. Only a German could have hit\non the idea that Germany is Hamlet. The English, for whom the play was\nwritten, know that Hamlet is Hamlet, and that Shakespeare was thinking\nof a young man, not of the pomposities of national ambition. But if\nthese clumsy allegories must be imposed upon great poets, Germany need\nnot go abroad to seek the likeness of her destiny. Germany is Faust; she\ndesired science and power and pleasure, and to get them on a short lease\nshe paid the price of her soul.\nFor the present, at any rate, the best thing the Germans can do with\nShakespeare is to leave him alone. They have divorced themselves from\ntheir own great poets, to follow vulgar half-witted political prophets.\nAs for Shakespeare, they have studied him assiduously, with the complete\napparatus of criticism, for a hundred years, and they do not understand\nthe plainest words of all his teaching.\nIn England he has always been understood; and it is only fair, to him\nand to ourselves, to add that he has never been regarded first and\nforemost as a national poet. His humanity is too calm and broad to\nsuffer the prejudices and exclusions of international enmities. The\nsovereignty that he holds has been allowed to him by men of all parties.\nThe schools of literature have, from the very first, united in his\npraise. Ben Jonson, who knew him and loved him, was a classical scholar,\nand disapproved of some of his romantic escapades, yet no one will ever\noutgo Ben Jonson’s praise of Shakespeare.\n  Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,\n  To whom all Scenes of Europe homage owe.\n  He was not-of an ago, but for all time!\nThe sects of religion forget their disputes and recognize the spirit of\nreligion in this profane author. He cannot be identified with any\ninstitution. According to the old saying, he gave up the Church and took\nto religion. Ho gave up the State, and took to humanity. The formularies\nand breviaries to which political and religious philosophers profess\ntheir allegiance were nothing to him. These formularies are a convenient\nshorthand, to save the trouble of thinking. But Shakespeare always\nthought. Every question that he treats is brought out of the realm of\nabstraction, and exhibited in its relation to daily life and the minds\nand hearts of men. He could never have been satisfied with such a smug\nphrase as ’the greatest happiness of the greatest number’. His mind\nwould have been eager for details. In what do the greatest number find\ntheir happiness? How far is the happiness of one consistent with the\nhappiness of another? What difficulties and miscarriages attend the\nbusiness of transmuting the recognized materials for happiness into\nliving human joy? Even these questions he would not have been content to\nhandle in high philosophic fashion; he would have insisted on instances,\nand would have subscribed to no code that is not carefully built out of\ncase-law. He knew that sanity is in the life of the senses; and that if\nthere are some philosophers who are not mad it is because they live a\ndouble life, and have consolations and resources of which their books\ntell you nothing. It is the part of their life which they do not think\nit worth their while to mention that would have interested Shakespeare.\nHe loves to reduce things to their elements. ’Is man no more than this?’\nsays the old king on the heath, as he gazes on the naked madman.\n’Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the\nsheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here’s three of us are\nsophisticated! Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more\nbut such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you\nlendings!’ That is how Shakespeare lays the mind of man bare, and strips\nhim of his pretences, to try if he be indeed noble. And he finds that\nman, naked and weak, hunted by misfortune, liable to all the sins and\nall the evils that follow frailty, still has faith left to him, and\ncharity. King Lear is still every inch a king.\nThat is not a little discovery, for when his mind came to grips with\nhuman life Shakespeare did not deal in rhetoric; so that the good he\nfinds is real good–’’tis in grain; ’twill endure wind and weather’.\nNothing is easier than to make a party of humanity, and to exalt mankind\nby ignorantly vilifying the rest of the animal creation, which is full\nof strange virtues and abilities. Shakespeare refused that way; he saw\nman weak and wretched, not able to maintain himself except as a\npensioner on the bounty of the world, curiously ignorant of his nature\nand his destiny, yet endowed with certain gifts in which he can find\nsustenance and rest, brave by instinct, so that courage is not so much\nhis virtue as cowardice is his lamentable and exceptional fault, ready\nto forget his pains or to turn them into pleasures by the alchemy of his\nmind, quick to believe, and slow to suspect or distrust, generous and\ntender to others, in so far as his thought and imagination, which are\nthe weakest things about him, enable him to bridge the spaces that\nseparate man from man, willing to make of life a great thing while he\nhas it, and a little thing when he comes to lose it. These are some of\nhis gifts; and Shakespeare would not have denied the saying of a thinker\nwith whom he has no very strong or natural affinity, that ’the greatest\nof these is charity’.\n\nThis full text of “England and the War” by Walter Raleigh belongs to the public domain.\n\n",

        "This book was not planned, but grew out of the troubles of the time.\nWhen, on one occasion or another, I was invited to lecture, I did not\nfind, with Milton’s Satan, that the mind is its own place; I could speak\nonly of what I was thinking of, and my mind was fixed on the War. I am\nunacquainted with military science, so my treatment of the War was\nlimited to an estimate of the characters of the antagonists.",
        "The character of Germany and the Germans is a riddle. I have seen no\nconvincing solution of it by any Englishman, and hardly any confident\nattempt at a solution which did not speak the uncontrolled language of\npassion. There is the same difficulty with the lower animals; our\ndescription of them tends to be a description of nothing but our own\nloves and hates. Who has ever fathomed the mind of a rhinoceros; or has\nremembered, while he faces the beast, that a good rhinoceros is a\npleasant member of the community in which his life is passed? We see\nonly the folded hide, the horn, and the angry little eye. We know that\nhe is strong and cunning, and that his desires and instincts are\ninconsistent with our welfare. Yet a rhinoceros is a simpler creature\nthan a German, and does not trouble our thought by conforming, on\noccasion, to civilized standards and humane conditions.",
        "It seems unreasonable to lay great stress on racial differences. The\ninsuperable barrier that divides England from Germany has grown out of\ncircumstance and habit and thought. For many hundreds of years the\nGerman peoples have stood to arms in their own defence against the\nencroachments of successive empires; and modern Germany learned the\ndoctrine of the omnipotence of force by prolonged suffering at the hands\nof the greatest master of that immoral school–the Emperor Napoleon. No\nGerman can understand the attitude of disinterested patronage which the\nEnglish mind quite naturally assumes when it is brought into contact\nwith foreigners. The best example of this superiority of attitude is to\nbe seen in the people who are called pacifists. They are a peculiarly\nEnglish type, and they are the most arrogant of all the English. The\nidea that they should ever have to fight for their lives is to them\nsupremely absurd. There must be some mistake, they think, which can be\neasily remedied once it is pointed out. Their title to existence is so\nclear to themselves that they are convinced it will be universally\nrecognized; it must not be made a matter of international conflict.\nPartly, no doubt, this belief is fostered by lack of imagination. The\nsheltered conditions and leisured life which they enjoy as the parasites\nof a dominant race have produced in them a false sense of security. But\nthere is something also of the English strength and obstinacy of\ncharacter in their self-confidence, and if ever Germany were to conquer\nEngland some of them would spring to their full stature as the heroes of\nan age-long and indomitable resistance. They are not held in much esteem\nto-day among their own people; they are useless for the work in hand;\nand their credit has suffered from the multitude of pretenders who make\nprinciple a cover for cowardice. But for all that, they are kin to the\nmakers of England, and the fact that Germany would never tolerate them\nfor an instant is not without its lesson.",
        "We shall never understand the Germans. Some of their traits may possibly\nbe explained by their history. Their passionate devotion to the State,\ntheir amazing vulgarity, their worship of mechanism and mechanical\nefficiency, are explicable in a people who are not strong in individual\ncharacter, who have suffered much to achieve union, and who have\nachieved it by subordinating themselves, soul and body, to a brutal\ntaskmaster. But the convulsions of war have thrown up things that are\ndeeper than these, primaeval things, which, until recently, civilization\nwas believed to have destroyed. The old monstrous gods who gave their\nnames to the days of the week are alive again in Germany. The English\nsoldier of to-day goes into action with the cold courage of a man who is\nprepared to make the best of a bad job. The German soldier sacrifices\nhimself, in a frenzy of religious exaltation, to the War-God. The\nfilthiness that the Germans use, their deliberate befouling of all that\nis elegant and gracious and antique, their spitting into the food that\nis to be eaten by their prisoners, their defiling with ordure the sacred\nvessels in the churches–all these things, too numerous and too\nmonotonous to describe, are not the instinctive coarsenesses of the\nbrute beast; they are a solemn ritual of filth, religiously practised,\nby officers no less than by men. The waves of emotional exaltation which\nfrom time to time pass over the whole people have the same character,\nthe character of savage religion.",
        "If they are alien to civilization when they fight, they are doubly alien\nwhen they reason. They are glib and fluent in the use of the terms which\nhave been devised for the needs of thought and argument, but their use\nof these terms is empty, and exhibits all the intellectual processes\nwith the intelligence left out. I know nothing more distressing than the\nattempt to follow any German argument concerning the War. If it were\nmerely wrong-headed, cunning, deceitful, there might still be some\ncompensation in its cleverness. There is no such compensation. The\nstatements made are not false, but empty; the arguments used are not\nbad, but meaningless. It is as if they despised language, and made use\nof it only because they believe that it is an instrument of deceit. But\na man who has no respect for language cannot possibly use it in such a\nmanner as to deceive others, especially if those others are accustomed\nto handle it delicately and powerfully. It ought surely to be easy to\napologize for a war that commands the whole-hearted support of a nation;\nbut no apology worthy of the name has been produced in Germany. The\npleadings which have been used are servile things, written to order, and\ndirected to some particular address, as if the truth were of no\nimportance. No one of these appeals has produced any appreciable effect\non the minds of educated Frenchmen, or Englishmen, or Americans, even\namong those who are eager to hear all that the enemy has to say for\nhimself. This is a strange thing; and is perhaps the widest breach of\nall. We are hopelessly separated from the Germans; we have lost the use\nof a common language, and cannot talk with them if we would.",
        "We cannot understand them; is it remotely possible that they will ever\nunderstand us? Here, too, the difficulties seem insuperable. It is true\nthat in the past they have shown themselves willing to study us and to\nimitate us. But unless they change their minds and their habits, it is\nnot easy to see how they are to get near enough to us to carry on their\nstudy. While they remain what they are we do not want them in our\nneighbourhood. We are not fighting to anglicize Germany, or to impose\nourselves on the Germans; our work is being done, as work is so often\ndone in this idle sport-loving country, with a view to a holiday. We\nwish to forget the Germans; and when once we have policed them into\nquiet and decency we shall have earned the right to forget them, at\nleast for a time. The time of our respite perhaps will not be long. If\nthe Allies defeat them, as the Allies will, it seems as certain as any\nuncertain thing can be that a mania for imitating British and American\ncivilization will take possession of Germany. We are not vindictive to a\nbeaten enemy, and when the Germans offer themselves as pupils we are not\nlikely to be either enthusiastic in our welcome or obstinate in our\nrefusal. We shall be bored but concessive. I confess that there are\nsome things in the prospect of this imitation which haunt me like a\nnightmare. The British soldier, whom the German knows to be second to\nnone, is distinguished for the levity and jocularity of his bearing in\nthe face of danger. What will happen when the German soldier attempts to\nimitate that? We shall be delivered from the German peril as when Israel\ncame out of Egypt, and the mountains skipped like rams.",
        "The only parts of this book for which I claim any measure of authority\nare the parts which describe the English character. No one of purely\nEnglish descent has ever been known to describe the English character,\nor to attempt to describe it. The English newspapers are full of praises\nof almost any of the allied troops other than the English regiments. I\nhave more Scottish and Irish blood in my veins than English; and I think\nI can see the English character truly, from a little distance. If, by\nsome fantastic chance, the statesmen of Germany could learn what I tell\nthem, it would save their country from a vast loss of life and from many\nhopeless misadventures. The English character is not a removable part of\nthe British Empire; it is the foundation of the whole structure, and the\nsecret strength of the American Republic. But the statesmen of Germany,\nwho fall easy victims to anything foolish in the shape of a theory that\nflatters their vanity, would not believe a word of my essays even if\nthey were to read them, so they must learn to know the English character\nin the usual way, as King George the Third learned to know it from\nEnglishmen resident in America.",
        "A habit of lying and a belief in the utility of lying are often\nattended by the most unhappy and paralysing effects. The liars become\nunable to recognize the truth when it is presented to them. This is the\nmisery which fate has fixed on the German cause. War, the Germans are\nfond of remarking, is war. In almost all wars there is something to be\nsaid on both sides of the question. To know that one side or the other\nis right may be difficult; but it is always useful to know why your\nenemies are fighting. We know why Germany is fighting; she explained it\nvery fully, by her most authoritative voices, on the very eve of the\nstruggle, and she has repeated it many times since in moments of\nconfidence or inadvertence. But here is the tragedy of Germany: she does\nnot know why we are fighting. We have told her often enough, but she\ndoes not believe it, and treats our statement as an exercise in the\ncunning use of what she calls ethical propaganda. Why ethics, or morals,\nshould be good enough to inspire sympathy, but not good enough to\ninspire war, is one of the mysteries of German thought. No German, not\neven any of those few feeble German writers who have fitfully criticized\nthe German plan, has any conception of the deep, sincere, unselfish, and\nrighteous anger that was aroused in millions of hearts by the cruelties\nof the cowardly assault on Serbia and on Belgium. The late German\nChancellor became uneasily aware that the crucifixion of Belgium was one\nof the causes which made this war a truceless war, and his offer, which\nno doubt seemed to him perfectly reasonable, was that Germany is willing\nto bargain about Belgium, and to relax her hold, in exchange for solid\nadvantages elsewhere. Perhaps he knew that if the Allies were to spend\nfive minutes in bargaining about Belgium they would thereby condone the\nGerman crime and would lose all that they have fought for. But it seems\nmore likely that he did not know it. The Allies know it.",
        "There is hope in these clear-cut issues. Of all wars that ever were\nfought this war is least likely to have an indecisive ending. It must be\nsettled one way or the other. If the Allied Governments were to make\npeace to-day, there would be no peace; the peoples of the free countries\nwould not suffer it. Germany cannot make peace, for she is bound by\nheavy promises to her people, and she cannot deliver the goods. She is\ntied to the stake, and must fight the course. Emaciated, exhausted,\nrepeating, as if in a bad dream, the old boastful appeals to military\nglory, she must go on till she drops, and then at last there will be\npeace.",
        "These may themselves seem boastful words; they cannot be proved except\nby the event. There are some few Englishmen, with no stomach for a\nfight, who think that England is in a bad way because she is engaged in\na war of which the end is not demonstrably certain. If the issues of\nwars were known beforehand, and could be discounted, there would be no\nwars. Good wars are fought by nations who make their choice, and would\nrather die than lose what they are fighting for. Military fortunes are\nnotoriously variable, and depend on a hundred accidents. Moral causes\nare constant, and operate all the time. The chief of these moral causes\nis the character of a people. Germany, by her vaunted study of the art\nand science of war, has got herself into a position where no success can\ncome to her except by way of the collapse or failure of the\nEnglish-speaking peoples. A study of the moral causes, if she were\ncapable of making it, would not encourage her in her old impious belief\nthat God will destroy these peoples in order to clear the way for the\ndominion of the Hohenzollerns.",
        "First published as one of the Oxford Pamphlets, October 1914\nIt is now recognized in England that our enemy in this war is not a\ntyrant military caste, but the united people of modern Germany. We have\nto combat an armed doctrine which is virtually the creed of all Germany.\nSaxony and Bavaria, it is true, would never have invented the doctrine;\nbut they have accepted it from Prussia, and they believe it. The\nPrussian doctrine has paid the German people handsomely; it has given\nthem their place in the world. When it ceases to pay them, and not till\nthen, they will reconsider it. They will not think, till they are\ncompelled to think. When they find themselves face to face with a\ngreater and more enduring strength than their own, they will renounce\ntheir idol. But they are a brave people, a faithful people, and a stupid\npeople, so that they will need rough proofs. They cannot be driven from\ntheir position by a little paper shot. In their present mood, if they\nhear an appeal to pity, sensibility, and sympathy, they take it for a\ncry of weakness. I am reminded of what I once heard said by a genial and\nhumane Irish officer concerning a proposal to treat with the leaders of\na Zulu rebellion. ’Kill them all,’ he said, ’it’s the only thing they\nunderstand.’ He meant that the Zulu chiefs would mistake moderation for\na sign of fear. By the irony of human history this sentence has become\nalmost true of the great German people, who built up the structure of\nmodern metaphysics. They can be argued with only by those who have the\nwill and the power to punish them.",
        "The doctrine that Might is Right, though it is true, is an unprofitable\ndoctrine, for it is true only in so broad and simple a sense that no one\nwould dream of denying it. If a single nation can conquer, depress, and\ndestroy all the other nations of the earth and acquire for itself a sole\ndominion, there may be matter for question whether God approves that\ndominion; what is certain is that He permits it. No earthly governor who\nis conscious of his power will waste time in listening to arguments\nconcerning what his power ought to be. His right to wield the sword can\nbe challenged only by the sword. An all-powerful governor who feared no\nassault would never trouble himself to assert that Might is Right. He\nwould smile and sit still. The doctrine, when it is propounded by weak\nhumanity, is never a statement of abstract truth; it is a declaration of\nintention, a threat, a boast, an advertisement. It has no value except\nwhen there is some one to be frightened. But it is a very dangerous\ndoctrine when it becomes the creed of a stupid people, for it flatters\ntheir self-sufficiency, and distracts their attention from the\ndifficult, subtle, frail, and wavering conditions of human power. The\ntragic question for Germany to-day is what she can do, not whether it is\nright for her to do it. The buffaloes, it must be allowed, had a\nperfect right to dominate the prairie of America, till the hunters came.\nThey moved in herds, they practised shock-tactics, they were violent,\nand very cunning. There are but few of them now. A nation of men who\nmistake violence for strength, and cunning for wisdom, may conceivably\nsuffer the fate of the buffaloes and perish without knowing why.",
        "To the English mind the German political doctrine is so incredibly\nstupid that for many long years, while men in high authority in the\nGerman Empire, ministers, generals, and professors, expounded that\ndoctrine at great length and with perfect clearness, hardly any one\ncould be found in England to take it seriously, or to regard it as\nanything but the vapourings of a crazy sect. England knows better now;\nthe scream of the guns has awakened her. The German doctrine is to be\nput to the proof. Who dares to say what the result will be? To predict\ncertain failure to the German arms is only a kind of boasting. Yet there\nare guarded beliefs which a modest man is free to hold till they are\nseen to be groundless. The Germans have taken Antwerp; they may possibly\ndestroy the British fleet, overrun England and France, repel Russia,\nestablish themselves as the dictators of Europe–in short, fulfil their\ndreams. What then? At an immense cost of human suffering they will have\nachieved, as it seems to us, a colossal and agonizing failure. Their\nengines of destruction will never serve them to create anything so fair\nas the civilization of France. Their uneasy jealousy and self-assertion\nis a miserable substitute for the old laws of chivalry and regard for\nthe weak, which they have renounced and forgotten. The will and high\npermission of all-ruling Heaven may leave them at large for a time, to\nseek evil to others. When they have finished with it, the world will\nhave to be remade.",
        "We cannot be sure that the Ruler of the world will forbid this. We\ncannot even be sure that the destroyers, in the peace that their\ndestruction will procure for them, may not themselves learn to rebuild.\nThe Goths, who destroyed the fabric of the Roman Empire, gave their\nname, in time, to the greatest mediaeval art. Nature, it is well known,\nloves the strong, and gives to them, and to them alone, the chance of\nbecoming civilized. Are the German people strong enough to earn that\nchance? That is what we are to see. They have some admirable elements of\nstrength, above any other European people. No other European army can be\nmarched, in close order, regiment after regiment, up the slope of a\nglacis, under the fire of machine guns, without flinching, to certain\ndeath. This corporate courage and corporate discipline is so great and\nimpressive a thing that it may well contain a promise for the future.\nMoreover, they are, within the circle of their own kin, affectionate and\ndutiful beyond the average of human society. If they succeed in their\nworldly ambitions, it will be a triumph of plain brute morality over all\nthe subtler movements of the mind and heart.",
        "On the other hand, it is true to say that history shows no precedent for\nthe attainment of world-wide power by a people so politically stupid as\nthe German people are to-day. There is no mistake about this; the\ninstances of German stupidity are so numerous that they make something\nlike a complete history of German international relations. Here is one.\nAny time during the last twenty years it has been matter of common\nknowledge in England that one event, and one only, would make it\nimpossible for England to remain a spectator in a European war–that\nevent being the violation of the neutrality of Holland or Belgium. There\nwas never any secret about this, it was quite well known to many people\nwho took no special interest in foreign politics. Germany has maintained\nin this country, for many years, an army of spies and secret agents; yet\nnot one of them informed her of this important truth. Perhaps the\nradical difference between the German and the English political systems\nblinded the astute agents. In England nothing really important is a\nsecret, and the amount of privileged political information to be gleaned\nin barbers’ shops, even when they are patronized by Civil servants, is\ndistressingly small. Two hours of sympathetic conversation with an\nordinary Englishman would have told the German Chancellor more about\nEnglish politics than ever he heard in his life. For some reason or\nother he was unable to make use of this source of intelligence, so that\nhe remained in complete ignorance of what every one in England knew and\nsaid.",
        "Here is another instance. The programme of German ambition has been\nvoluminously published for the benefit of the world. France was first to\nbe crushed; then Russia; then, by means of the indemnities procured from\nthese conquests, after some years of recuperation and effort, the naval\npower of England was to be challenged and destroyed. This programme was\nset forth by high authorities, and was generally accepted; there was no\ncriticism, and no demur. The crime against the civilization of the world\nforeshadowed in the horrible words ’France is to be crushed’ is before a\nhigh tribunal; it would be idle to condemn it here. What happened is\nthis. The French and Russian part of the programme was put into action\nlast July. England, who had been told that her turn was not yet, that\nGermany would be ready for her in a matter of five or ten years, very\nnaturally refused to wait her turn. She crowded up on to the scaffold,\nwhich even now is in peril of breaking down under the weight of its\nvictims, and of burying the executioner in its ruins. But because\nEngland would not wait her turn, she is overwhelmed with accusations of\ntreachery and inhumanity by a sincerely indignant Germany. Could\nstupidity, the stupidity of the wise men of Gotham, be more fantastic or\nmore monstrous?",
        "German stupidity was even more monstrous. A part of the accusation\nagainst England is that she has raised her hand against the nation\nnearest to her in blood. The alleged close kinship of England and\nGermany is based on bad history and doubtful theory. The English are a\nmixed race, with enormous infusions of Celtic and Roman blood. The Roman\nsculpture gallery at Naples is full of English faces. If the German\nagents would turn their attention to hatters’ shops, and give the\nbarbers a rest, they would find that no English hat fits any German\nhead. But suppose we were cousins, or brothers even, what kind of\nargument is that on the lips of those who but a short time before were\nexplaining, with a good deal of zest and with absolute frankness, how\nthey intended to compass our ruin? There is something almost amiable in\nfatuity like this. A touch of the fool softens the brute.",
        "The Germans have a magnificent war-machine which rolls on its way,\ncrushing all that it touches. We shall break it if we can. If we fail,\nthe German nation is at the beginning, not the end, of its troubles.\nWith the making of peace, even an armed peace, the war-machine has\nserved its turn; some other instrument of government must then be\ninvented. There is no trace of a design for this new instrument in any\nof the German shops. The governors of Alsace-Lorraine offer no\nsuggestions. The bald fact is that there is no spot in the world where\nthe Germans govern another race and are not hated. They know this, and\nare disquieted; they meet with coldness on all hands, and their remedy\nfor the coldness is self-assertion and brag. The Russian statesman was\nright who remarked that modern Germany has been too early admitted into\nthe comity of European nations. Her behaviour, in her new international\nrelations, is like the behaviour of an uneasy, jealous upstart in an\nold-fashioned quiet drawing-room. She has no genius for equality; her\nmanners are a compound of threatening and flattery. When she wishes to\nassert herself, she bullies; when she wishes to endear herself, she\ncrawls; and the one device is no more successful than the other.",
        "Might is Right; but the sort of might which enables one nation to govern\nanother in time of peace is very unlike the armoured thrust of the\nwar-engine. It is a power compounded of sympathy and justice. The\nEnglish (it is admitted by many foreign critics) have studied justice\nand desired justice. They have inquired into and protected rights that\nwere unfamiliar, and even grotesque, to their own ideas, because they\nbelieved them to be rights. In the matter of sympathy their reputation\ndoes not stand so high; they are chill in manner, and dislike all\neffusive demonstrations of feeling. Yet those who come to know them know\nthat they are not unimaginative; they have a genius for equality; and\nthey do try to put themselves in the other fellow’s place, to see how\nthe position looks from that side. What has happened in India may\nperhaps be taken to prove, among many other things, that the inhabitants\nof India begin to know that England has done her best, and does feel a\ndisinterested solicitude for the peoples under her charge. She has long\nbeen a mother of nations, and is not frightened by the problems of\nadolescence.",
        "The Germans have as yet shown no sign of skill in governing other\npeoples. Might is Right; and it is quite conceivable that they may\nacquire colonies by violence. If they want to keep them they will have\nto shut their own professors’ books, and study the intimate history of\nthe British Empire. We are old hands at the business; we have lost more\ncolonies than ever they owned, and we begin to think that we have learnt\nthe secret of success. At any rate, our experience has done much for us,\nand has helped us to avoid failure. Yet the German colonial party stare\nat us with bovine malevolence. In all the library of German theorizing\nyou will look in vain for any explanation of the fact that the Boers\nare, in the main, loyal to the British Empire. If German political\nthinkers could understand that political situation, which seems to\nEnglish minds so simple, there might yet be hope for them. But they\nregard it all as a piece of black magic, and refuse to reason about it.\nHow should a herd of cattle be driven without goads? Witchcraft,\nwitchcraft!",
        "Their world-wide experience it is, perhaps, which has made the English\nquick to appreciate the virtues of other peoples. I have never known an\nEnglishman who travelled in Russia without falling in love with the\nRussian people. I have never heard a German speak of the Russian people\nwithout contempt and dislike. Indeed the Germans are so unable to see\nany charm in that profound and humane people that they believe that the\nEnglish liking for them must be an insincere pretence, put forward for\nwicked or selfish reasons. What would they say if they saw a sight that\nis common in Indian towns, a British soldier and a Gurkha arm in arm,\nrolling down the street in cheerful brotherhood? And how is it that it\nhas never occurred to any of them that this sort of brotherhood has its\nvalue in Empire-building? The new German political doctrine has bidden\nfarewell to Christianity, but there are some political advantages in\nChristianity which should not be overlooked. It teaches human beings to\nthink of one another and to care for one another. It is an antidote to\nthe worst and most poisonous kind of political stupidity.",
        "Another thing that the Germans will have to learn for the welfare of\ntheir much-talked Empire is the value of the lone man. The architects\nand builders of the British Empire were all lone men. Might is Right;\nbut when a young Englishman is set down at an outpost of Empire to\ngovern a warlike tribe, he has to do a good deal of hard thinking on the\nproblem of political power and its foundations. He has to trust to\nhimself, to form his own conclusions, and to choose his own line of\naction. He has to try to find out what is in the mind of others. A young\nGerman, inured to skilled slavery, does not shine in such a position.\nMan for man, in all that asks for initiative and self-dependence,\nEnglishmen are the better men, and some Germans know it. There is an old\njest that if you settle an Englishman and a German together in a new\ncountry, at the end of a year you will find the Englishman governor, and\nthe German his head clerk. A German must know the rules before he can\nget to work.",
        "More than three hundred years ago a book was written in England which is\nin some ways a very exact counterpart to General von Bernhardi’s\nnotorious treatise. It is called Tamburlaine, and, unlike its\nsuccessor, is full of poetry and beauty. Our own colonization began with\na great deal of violent work, and much wrong done to others. We suffered\nfor our misdeeds, and we learned our lesson, in part at least. Why, it\nmay be asked, should not the Germans begin in the same manner, and by\ndegrees adapt themselves to the new task? Perhaps they may, but if they\ndo, they cannot claim the Elizabethans for their model. Of all men on\nearth the German is least like the undisciplined, exuberant Elizabethan\nadventurer. He is reluctant to go anywhere without a copy of the rules,\na guarantee of support, and a regular pension. His outlook is as prosaic\nas General von Bernhardi’s or General von der Golt’s own, and that is\nsaying a great deal. In all the German political treatises there is an\nimmeasurable dreariness. They lay down rules for life, and if they be\nasked what makes such a life worth living they are without any hint of\nan answer. Their world is a workhouse, tyrannically ordered, and full of\npusillanimous jealousies.",
        "It is not impious to be hopeful. A Germanized world would be a\nnightmare. We have never attempted or desired to govern them, and we\nmust not think that God will so far forget them as to permit them to\nattempt to govern us. Now they hate us, but they do not know for how\nmany years the cheerful brutality of their political talk has shocked\nand disgusted us. I remember meeting, in one of the French Mediterranean\ndependencies, with a Prussian nobleman, a well-bred and pleasant man,\nwho was fond of expounding the Prussian creed. He was said to be a\npolitical agent of sorts, but he certainly learned nothing in\nconversation. He talked all the time, and propounded the most monstrous\nparadoxes with an air of mathematical precision. Now it was the\ncharacter of Sir Edward Grey, a cunning Machiavel, whose only aim was to\nset Europe by the ears and make neighbours fall out. A friend who was\nwith me, an American, laughed aloud at this, and protested, without\nproducing the smallest effect. The stream of talk went on. The error of\nthe Germans, we were told, was always that they are too humane; their\ndislike of cruelty amounts to a weakness in them. They let France escape\nwith a paltry fine, next time France must be beaten to the dust. Always\nwith a pleasant outward courtesy, he passed on to England. England was\ndecadent and powerless, her rule must pass to the Germans. ’But we shall\ntreat England rather less severely than France,’ said this bland apostle\nof Prussian culture, ’for we wish to make it possible for ourselves to\nremain in friendly relations with other English-speaking peoples.’ And\nso on–the whole of the Bernhardi doctrine, explained in quiet fashion\nby a man whose very debility of mind made his talk the more impressive,\nfor he was simply parroting what he had often heard. No one criticized\nhis proposals, nor did we dislike him. It all seemed too mad; a rather\nclumsy jest. His world of ideas did not touch our world at any point, so\nthat real talk between us was impossible. He came to see us several\ntimes, and always gave the same kind of mesmerized recital of Germany’s\npolicy. The grossness of the whole thing was in curious contrast with\nthe polite and quiet voice with which he uttered his insolences. When I\nremember his talk I find it easy to believe that the German Emperor and\nthe German Chancellor have also talked in such a manner that they have\nnever had the smallest opportunity of learning what Englishmen think and\nmean.",
        "While the German doctrine was the plaything merely of hysterical and\nsupersensitive persons, like Carlyle and Nietzsche, it mattered little\nto the world of politics. An excitable man, of vivid imagination and\ninvalid constitution, like Carlyle, feels a natural predilection for the\ncult of the healthy brute. Carlyle’s English style is itself a kind of\nepilepsy. Nietzsche was so nervously sensitive that everyday life was an\nanguish to him, and broke his strength. Both were poets, as Marlowe was\na poet, and both sang the song of Power. The brutes of the swamp and the\nfield, who gathered round them and listened, found nothing new or\nunfamiliar in the message of the poets. ’This’, they said, ’is what we\nhave always known, but we did not know that it is poetry. Now that great\npoets teach it, we need no longer be ashamed of it.’ So they went away\nresolved to be twice the brutes that they were before, and they named\nthemselves Culture-brutes.",
        "It is difficult to see how the world, or any considerable part of it,\ncan belong to Germany, till she changes her mind. If she can do that,\nshe might make a good ruler, for she has solid virtues and good\ninstincts. It is her intellect that has gone wrong. Bishop Butler was\none day found pondering the problem whether, a whole nation can go mad.\nIf he had lived to-day what would he have said about it? Would he have\nadmitted that that strangest of grim fancies is realized?",
        "It would be vain for Germany to take the world; she could not keep it;\nnor, though she can make a vast number of people miserable for a long\ntime, could she ever hope to make all the inhabitants of the world\nmiserable for all time. She has a giant’s power, and does not think it\ninfamous to use it like a giant. She can make a winter hideous, but she\ncannot prohibit the return of spring, or annul the cleansing power of\nwater. Sanity is not only better than insanity; it is much stronger, and\nMight is Right.",
        "Meantime, it is a delight and a consolation to Englishmen that England\nis herself again. She has a cause that it is good to fight for, whether\nit succeed or fail. The hope that uplifts her is the hope of a better\nworld, which our children shall see. She has wonderful friends. From\nwhat self-governing nations in the world can Germany hear such messages\nas came to England from the Dominions oversea? ’When England is at war,\nCanada is at war.’ ’To the last man and the last shilling, Australia\nwill support the cause of the Empire.’ These are simple words, and\nsufficient; having said them, Canada and Australia said no more. In the\ncompany of such friends, and for the creed that she holds, England might\nbe proud to die; but surely her time is not yet.",
        "  Our faith is ours, and comes not on a tide;\n  And whether Earth’s great offspring by decree\n  Must rot if they abjure rapacity,\n  Not argument, but effort shall decide.\n  They number many heads in that hard flock,\n  Trim swordsmen they push forth, yet try thy steel;\n  Thou, fighting for poor human kind, shalt feel\n  The strength of Roland in thy wrist to hew\n  A chasm sheer into the barrier rock,\n  And bring the army of the faithful through.",
        "An Address to the Royal Colonial Institute, December 12, 1916\nI hold, as I daresay you do, that we are at a crisis of our history\nwhere there is not much room for talk. The time when this struggle might\nhave been averted or won by talk is long past. During the hundred years\nbefore the war we have not talked much, or listened much, to the\nGermans. For fifty of those years at least the head of waters that has\nnow been let loose in a devastating flood over Europe was steadily\naccumulating; but we paid little attention to it. People sometimes speak\nof the negotiations of the twelve days before the war as if the whole\nsecret and cause of the war could be found there; but it is not so.\nStatesmen, it is true, are the keepers of the lock-gates, but those\nkeepers can only delay, they cannot prevent an inundation that has great\nnatural causes. The world has in it evil enough, and darkness enough.\nBut it is not so bad and so dark that a slip in diplomacy, a careless\nword, or an impolite gesture, can instantaneously, as if by magic,\ninvolve twenty million men in a struggle to the death. It is only\nclever, conceited men, proud of their neat little minds, who think that\nbecause they cannot fathom the causes of the war, it might easily have\nbeen prevented. I confess I find it difficult to conceive of the war in\nterms of simple right and wrong. We must respect the tides, and their\nhuge unintelligible force teaches us to respect them.",
        "It is not a war of race. For all our differences with the Germans, any\ncool and impartial mind must admit that we have many points of kinship\nwith them. During the years before the war our naval officers in the\nMediterranean found, I believe, that it was easier to associate on terms\nof social friendship with the Austrians than with the officers of any\nother foreign navy. We have a passionate admiration for France, and a\nreal devotion to her, but that is a love affair, not a family tie. We\nbegin to be experienced in love affairs, for Ireland steadily refuses to\nbe treated on any other footing. In any case, we are much closer to the\nGermans than they are to the Bulgarians or the Turks. Of these three we\nlike the Turks the best, because they are chivalrous and generous\nenemies, which the Germans are not.",
        "It is a war of ideas. We are fighting an armed doctrine. Yet Burke’s use\nof those words to describe the military power of Revolutionary France\nshould warn us against fallacious attempts to simplify the issue. When\nideas become motives and are filtered into practice, they lose their\nclearness of outline and are often hard to recognize. They leaven the\nlump, but the lump is still human clay, with its passions and\nprejudices, its pride and its hate. I remember seeing in a provincial\npaper, in the early days of the war, two adjacent columns, both dealing\nwith the war. The first was headed ’A Holy War’ and set forth the great\nprinciples of nationality, respect for treaties, and protection of the\nweak, which in our opinion are the main motives of the Allies in this\nwar. The second was headed ’The War on Commerce; Tips to capture German\ntrade’, and set forth those other principles and motives which, in the\nopinion of the Germans, brought England into this war.",
        "I am not going to defend England against the charge that she entered\nthis war on a cold calculation of mercantile profit. Every one here\nknows that the charge is utterly untrue. Those who believe the charge\ncould not be shaken in their belief except by being educated all over\nagain, and introduced to some knowledge of human nature. It is enough to\nremark that this charge is a commonplace between belligerent nations.\nThey all like to believe that their adversaries entertain only base\nmotives, while they themselves act only on the loftiest ideal\npromptings. If the charge means only that every nation at war is bound\nto think of its own interests, to conserve its own strength, and to\nseize on all material gains that are within its reach, the charge is\ntrue and harmless. When two angry women quarrel in a back street, they\ncommonly accuse each other of being amorous. They might just as well\naccuse each other of being human. The charge is true and insignificant.\nSo also with nations; they all cherish themselves and seek to preserve\ntheir means of livelihood.",
        "If this were their sole concern, there would be few wars; certainly this\nwar, which is desolating and impoverishing Europe, would be impossible.\nNo one, surely, can look at the war and say that nations are moved only\nby their material interests. It would be more plausible to say that they\nare too little moved by those interests. Bacon, in his essay Of Death,\nremarks that the fear of death does not much affect mankind. ’There is\nno passion in the mind of man so weak, but it mates and masters the\nfear of death; and therefore death is no such terrible enemy when a man\nhath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him.\nRevenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honour aspireth to it;\ngrief flieth to it, fear pre-occupateth it; nay, we read, after Otho the\nEmperor had slain himself, pity (which is the tenderest of affections)\nprovoked many to die out of mere compassion to their sovereign, and as\nthe truest sort of followers.’ If this is true of the fear of death, how\nmuch truer it is of the love of material gain. Any whim, or point of\npride, or fixed idea, or old habit, is enough to make a man or a nation\nforgo the hope of profit and fight for a creed.",
        "The German creed is by this time well known. Before the war we took\nlittle notice of it. We sometimes saw it stated in print, but it seemed\nto us too monstrous and inhuman to be the creed of a whole people. We\nwere wrong; it was the creed of a whole people. By the mesmerism of\nState education, by the discipline of universal military service, by the\npride of the German people in their past victories, and by the fears\nnatural to a nation that finds enemies on all its fronts, an absolute\nbelief in the State, in war as the highest activity of the State, and in\nthe right of the State to enslave all its subjects, body and soul, to\nits purposes, had become the creed of all those diverse peoples that are\nunited under the Prussian Monarchy. Most of them are not naturally\nwarlike peoples. They have been lured, and frightened, and drilled, and\nbribed into war, but it is true to say that, on the whole, they enjoy\nfighting less than we do. One of the truest remarks ever made on the war\nwas that famous remark of a British private soldier, who was telling\nhow his company took a trench from the enemy. Fearing that his account\nof the affair might sound boastful, he added, ’You see, Sir, they’re not\na military people, like we are.’ Only the word was wrong, the meaning\nwas right. They are, as every one knows, an enormously military people,\nand, if they want to fight at all, they have to be a military people,\nfor the vast majority of them are not a warlike people. A first-class\narmy could never have been fashioned in Germany out of volunteer\ncivilians, like our army on the Somme. That army has a little shaken the\nfaith of the Germans in their creed. Again I must quote one of our\nsoldiers: ’I don’t say’, he remarked, ’that our average can run rings\nround their best; what I say is that our average is better than their\naverage, and our best is better than their best.’ The Germans already\nare uneasy about their creed and their system, but there is no escape\nfor them; they have sacrificed everything to it; they have impoverished\nthe mind and drilled the imagination of every German citizen, so that\nGermany appears before the world with the body of a giant and the mind\nof a dwarf; they have sacrificed themselves in millions that their creed\nmay prevail, and with their creed they must stand or fall. The State,\norganized as absolute power, responsible to no one, with no duties to\nits neighbour, and with only nominal duties to a strictly subordinate\nGod, has challenged the soul of man in its dearest possessions. We\ncannot predict the course of military operations; but if we were not\nsure of the ultimate issue of this great struggle, we should have no\nsufficient motive for continuing to breathe. The State has challenged\nthe soul of man before now, and has always been defeated. A miserable\nremnant of men and women, tied to stakes or starved in dungeons, have\nbefore now shattered what seemed an omnipotent tyranny, because they\nstood for the soul and were not prompted by vanity or self-regard. They\nhad great allies–",
        "     ’Their friends were exultations, agonies,\n     And love, and man’s unconquerable mind.’",
        "If we are defeated we shall be defeated not by German strength but by\nour own weakness. The worst enemy of the martyr is doubt and the divided\nmind, which suggests the question, ’Is it, after all, worth while?’ We\nmust know what we have believed. What do we stand for in this war? It is\nonly the immovable conviction that we stand for something ultimate and\nessential that can help us and carry us through. No war of this kind and\non this scale is good enough to fight unless it is good enough to fail\nin. ’The calculation of profit’, said Burke,’in all such wars is false.\nOn balancing the account of such wars, ten thousand hogs-heads of sugar\nare purchased at ten thousand times their price. The blood of man should\nnever be shed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well shed for our\nfamily, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The\nrest is vanity; the rest is crime.’",
        "The question I have asked is a difficult question to answer, or, rather,\nthe answer is not easy to formulate briefly and clearly. Most of the men\nat the front know quite well what they are fighting for; they know that\nit is for their country, but that it is also for their kind–for certain\nideals of humanity. We at home know that we are at war for liberty and\nhumanity. But these words are invoked by different nations in different\nsenses; the Germans, or at least most of them, have as much liberty as\nthey desire, and believe that the highest good of humanity is to be\nfound in the prevalence of their own ideas and of their own type of\ngovernment and society. No abstract demonstration can help us. Liberty\nis a highly comparative notion; no one asks for it complete. Humanity is\na highly variable notion; it is interpreted in different senses by\ndifferent societies. What we are confronted by is two types of\ncharacter, two sets of aims, two ideals for society. There can be no\nharm in trying to understand both.",
        "The Germans can never be understood by those who neglect their history.\nThey are a solid, brave, and earnest people, who, till quite recent\ntimes, have been denied their share in the government of Europe. In the\nsixteenth century they were deeply stirred by questions of religion, and\nwere rent asunder by the Reformation. Compromise proved futile; the\nsmall German states were ranked on this side or on that at the will of\ntheir rulers and princes; men of the same race were ranged in mortal\nopposition on the question of religious belief, and there was no\nsolution but war. For thirty years in the seventeenth century the war\nraged. It was conducted with a fierceness and inhumanity that even the\npresent war has not equalled. The civilian population suffered\nhideously. Whole provinces were desolated and whole states were bereaved\nof their men. When, from mere exhaustion, the war came to an end,\nGermany lay prostrate, and the chief gains of the war fell to the rising\nmonarchy of France, which had intervened in the middle of the struggle.\nBy the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 Alsace and Lorraine went to France,\nand the rule of the great monarch, Louis XIV, had nothing to fear from\nthe German peoples. The ambitions of Germany, for long after this, were\nmainly cosmopolitan and intellectual. But political ambitions, though\nthey seemed almost dead, were revived by the hardy state of Prussia, and\nthe rest of Germany’s history, down to our own time, is the history of\nthe welding of the Germanic peoples into a single state by Prussian\nmonarchs and statesmen.",
        "This history explains many things. If a people has a corporate memory,\nif it can learn from its own sufferings, Germany has reason enough to\ncherish with a passionate devotion her late achieved unity. And German\nbrutality, which is not the less brutality because Germans regard it as\nquite natural and right, has its origin in German history. The Prussian\nis a Spartan, a natural brute, but brutal to himself as well as to\nothers, capable of extremes of self-denial and self-discipline. From the\nPrussians the softer and more emotional German peoples of the South\nreceived the gift of national unity, and they repaid the debt by\nextravagant admiration for Prussian prowess and hardihood, which had\nbeen so serviceable to their cause. The Southern Germans, the Bavarians\nespecially, have developed a sort of sentimentalism of brutality,\nexpressed in the hysterical Hymn of Hate (which hails from Munich),\nexpressed also in those monstrous excesses and cruelties, surpassing\nanything that mere insensibility can produce, which have given the\nBavarian troops their foul reputation in the present war.",
        "The last half century of German history must also be remembered. Three\nassaults on neighbouring states were rewarded by a great increase of\nterritory and of strength. From Denmark, in 1864, Prussia took\nSchleswig-Holstein. The defeat of Austria in 1866 brought Hanover and\nBavaria under the Prussian leadership; Alsace and Lorraine were regained\nfrom France in 1870. The Prussian mind, which is not remarkable for\nsubtlety, found a justification in these three wars for its favourite\ndoctrine of frightfulness. That doctrine, put briefly, is that people\ncan always be frightened into submission, and that it is cheaper to\nfrighten them than to fight them to the bitter end. Denmark was a small\nnation, and moreover was left utterly unsupported by the European powers\nwho had guaranteed her integrity. Bavaria was frightened, and will be\nfrightened again when her hot fit gives way to her cold fit. France was\ndivided and half-hearted under a tinsel emperor. It is Germany’s\nmisfortune that on these three special cases she based a general\ndoctrine of war. A very little knowledge of human nature–a knowledge so\nalien to her that she calls it psychology and assigns it to\nspecialists–would have taught her that, for the most part, human beings\nwhen they are fighting for their homes and their faith cannot be\nfrightened, and must be killed or conciliated. The practice of\nfrightfulness has not worked very well in this war. It has steeled the\nheart of Germany’s enemies. It has produced in her victims a temper of\nhate that will outlive this generation, and will make the small peoples\nwhom she has kicked and trampled on impossible subjects of the German\nEmpire. Worst of all it has suggested to onlookers that the people who\nhave so plenary a belief in frightfulness are not themselves strangers\nto fear. There is an old English proverb, hackneyed and stale three\nhundred years ago, but now freshened again by disuse, that the goodwife\nwould never have looked for her daughter in the oven unless she had been\nthere herself.",
        "How shall I describe the English temper, which the Germans, high and\nlow, learned and ignorant, have so profoundly mistaken? You can get no\ndescription of it from the Englishman pure and simple; he has no theory\nof himself, and it bores him to hear himself described. Yet it is this\ntemper which has given England her great place in the world and which\nhas cemented the British Empire. It is to be found not in England alone,\nbut wherever there is a strain of English blood or an acceptance of\nEnglish institutions. You can find it in Australia, in Canada, in\nAmerica; it infects Scotland, and impresses Wales. It is everywhere in\nour trenches to-day. It is not clannish, or even national, it is\nessentially the lonely temper of a man independent to the verge of\nmelancholy. An admirable French writer of to-day has said that the best\nhandbook and guide to the English temper is Defoe’s romance of Robinson\nCrusoe. Crusoe is practical, but is conscious of the over-shadowing\npresence of the things that are greater than man. He makes his own\nclothing, teaches his goats to dance, and wrestles in thought with the\nproblems suggested by his Bible. Another example of the same temper may\nbe seen in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, and yet another in\nWordsworth’s Prelude. There is no danger that English thought will\never underestimate the value and meaning of the individual soul. The\ngreatest English literature, it might almost be said, from Shakespeare’s\nHamlet to Browning’s The Ring and the Book, is concerned with no\nother subject. The age-long satire against the English is that in\nEngland every man claims the right to go to heaven his own way. English\ninstitutions, instead of subduing men to a single pattern, are devised\nchiefly with the object of saving the rights of the subject and the\nliberty of the individual. ’Every man in his humour’ is an English\nproverb, and might almost be a statement of English constitutional\ndoctrine. But this extreme individualism is the right of all, and does\nnot favour self-exaltation. The English temper has an almost morbid\ndislike of all that is showy or dramatic in expression. I remember how a\nWinchester boy, when he was reproached with the fact that Winchester has\nproduced hardly any great men, replied, ’No, indeed, I should think not.\nWe would pretty soon have knocked that out of them.’ And the epigrams of\nthe English temper usually take the form of understatement. ’Give\nDayrolles a chair’ were the last dying words of Lord Chesterfield,\nspoken of the friend who had come to see him. When the French troops go\nover the parapet to make an advance, their battle cry shouts the praises\nof their Country. The British troops prefer to celebrate the advance in\na more trivial fashion, ’This way to the early door, sixpence extra.’",
        "I might go on interminably with this dissertation, but I have said\nenough for my purpose. The history of England has had much to do with\nmoulding the English temper. We have been protected from direct\nexposure to the storms that have swept the Continent. Our wars on land\nhave been adventures undertaken by expeditionary forces. At sea, while\nthe power of England was growing, we have been explorers, pirates,\nbuccaneers. Now that we are involved in a great European war on land,\nour methods have been changed. The artillery and infantry of a modern\narmy cannot act effectively on their own impulse. We hold the sea, and\nthe pirates’ work for the present has passed into other hands. But our\nspirit and temper is the same as of old. It has found a new world in the\nair. War in the air, under the conditions of to-day, demands all the old\ngallantry and initiative. The airman depends on his own brain and nerve;\nhe cannot fall back on orders from his superiors. Our airmen of to-day\nare the true inheritors of Drake; they have the same inspired\nrecklessness, the same coolness, and the same chivalry to a vanquished\nenemy.",
        "I am a very bad example of the English temper; for the English temper\ngrumbles at all this, to the great relief of our enemies, who believe\nthat what a man admits against his own nation must be true. Our\npessimists, by indulging their natural vein, serve us, without reward,\nquite as well as Germany is served by her wireless press. They deceive\nthe enemy.",
        "Modern Germany has organized and regimented her people like an ant-hill\nor a beehive. The people themselves, including many who belong to the\nupper class, are often simple villagers in temper, full of kindness and\nanger, much subject to envy and jealousy, not magnanimous, docile and\nobedient to a fault. If they claimed, as individuals, to represent the\nhighest reach of European civilization, the claim would be merely\nabsurd. So they shift their ground, and pretend that society is greater\nthan man, and that by their painstaking organization their society has\nbeen raised to the pinnacle of human greatness. They make this claim so\ninsistently, and in such obvious good faith, that some few weak tempers\nand foolish minds in England have been impressed by it. These\npanic-stricken counsellors advise us, without delay, to reform our\ninstitutions and organize them upon the German model. Only thus, they\ntell us, can we hold our own against so huge a power. But if we were to\ntake their advice, we should have nothing of our own left to hold. It is\nreasonable and good to co-operate and organize in order to attain an\nagreed object, but German organization goes far beyond this. The German\nnation is a carefully built, smooth-running machine, with powerful\nengines. It has only one fault–that any fool can drive it; and seeing\nthat the governing class in Germany is obstinate and unimaginative,\nthere is no lack of drivers to pilot it to disaster. The best ability of\nGermany is seen in her military organization. Napoleon is her worshipped\nmodel, and, like many admirers of Napoleon, she thinks only of his great\ncampaigns; she forgets that he died in St. Helena, and that his schemes\nfor the reorganization of Europe failed.",
        "I know that many people in England are not daunted but depressed by the\nmilitary successes of the enemy. Our soldiers in the field are not\ndepressed. But we who are kept at home suffer from the miasma of the\nback-parlour. We read the headlines of newspapers–a form of literature\nthat is exciting enough, but does not merit the praise given to\nSophocles, who saw life steadily and saw it whole. We keep our ears to\nthe telephone, and we forget that the great causes which are always at\nwork, and which will shape the issues of this war, are not recorded upon\nthe telephone. There are things truer and more important than the latest\ndispatches. Here is one of them. The organization of the second-rate can\nnever produce anything first-rate. We do not understand a people who,\nwhen it comes to the last push of man against man, throw up their hands\nand utter the pathetic cry of ’Kamerad’. To surrender is a weakness that\nno one who has not been under modern artillery fire has any right to\ncondemn; to profess a sudden affection for the advancing enemy is not\nweakness but baseness. Or rather, it would be baseness in a voluntary\nsoldier; in the Germans it means only that the war is not their own war;\nthat they are fighting as slaves, not as free men. The idea that we\ncould ever live under the rule of these people is merely comic. To do\nthem justice, they do not now entertain the idea, though they have\ndallied with it in the past.",
        "No harm can be done, I think, by preaching to the English people the\nnecessity for organization and discipline. We shall still be ourselves,\nand there is no danger that we shall overdo discipline or make\norganization a thing to be worshipped for its own sake. The danger is\nall the other way. We have learnt much from the war, and the work that\nwe shall have to do when it ends is almost more important than the terms\nof peace, or concessions made this way and that. If the treacherous\nassault of the Germans on the liberties and peace of Europe is rewarded\nby any solid gain to the German Empire, then history may forgive them,\nbut this people of the British Empire will not forgive them. Nothing\nwill be as it was before; and our cause, which will not be lost in the\nwar, will still have to be won in the so-called peace. I know that some\nsay, ’Let us have war when we are at war, and peace when we are at\npeace’. It sounds plausible and magnanimous, but it is Utopian. You must\nreckon with your own people. They know that when we last had peace, the\nsunshine of that peace was used by the Germans to hatch the spawn of\nmalice and treason. If the Germans are defeated in the war, we shall, I\nsuppose, forgive them, for the very English reason that it is a bore not\nto forgive your enemies. But if they escape without decisive defeat in\nbattle, their harder trial is yet to come.",
        "In some ways we are stronger than we have been in all our long history.\nWe have found ourselves, and we have found our friends. Our dead have\ntaught the children of to-day more and better than any living teachers\ncan teach them. No one in this country will ever forget how the people\nof the Dominions, at the first note of war, sprang to arms like one man.\nWe must not thank or praise them; like the Navy, they regard our thanks\nand praise as something of an impertinence. They are not fighting, they\nsay, for us. But that is how we discovered them. They are doing much\nbetter than fighting for us, they are fighting with us, because, without\na word of explanation or appeal, their ideas and ours are the same. We\nnever have discussed with them, and we never shall discuss, what is\ndecent and clean and honourable in human behaviour. A philosopher who\nis interested in this question can find plenty of intellectual exercise\nby discussing it with the Germans, Where an Englishman, a Canadian, and\nan Australian are met, there is no material for such a debate.",
        "It would be extravagant to suppose that a discovery like this can leave\nour future relations untouched. We now know that we are profoundly\nunited in a union much stronger and deeper than any mechanism can\nproduce. I know how difficult a problem it is to hit on the best device\nfor giving political expression to this union between States separated\nfrom one another by the whole world’s diameter, differing in their\ncircumstances, their needs, and their outlook. I do not dare to\nprescribe; but I should like to make a few remarks, and to call\nattention to a few points which are perhaps more present to the mind of\nthe ordinary citizen than they are in the discussions of constitutional\nexperts.",
        "We must arrange for co-operation and mutual support. If the arrangement\nis complicated and lengthy, we must not wait for it; we must meet and\ndiscuss our common affairs. Ministers from the Dominions have already\nsat with the British Cabinet. We can never go back on that; it is a\nlandmark in our history. Our Ministers must travel; if their supporters\nare impatient of their absence on the affairs of the Empire, they must\nfind some less parochial set of supporters. We have begun in the right\nway; the right way is not to pass laws determining what you are to do;\nbut to do what is needful, and do it at once,–do a lot of things, and\nregularize your successes by later legislation. Now is the time, while\nthe Empire is white-hot. Our first need is not lawyers, but men who,\nfeeling friendly, know how to behave as friends do. They will not be\nimpeached if they go beyond the letter of the law. One act of faith is\nworth a hundred arguments. This is a family affair; the habits of an\naffectionate and united family are the only good model.",
        "As for the Crown Colonies and India, the Dominions must share our\nburden. It is objected, both here and in India, that life in the\nDominions is a very inadequate education for the sympathetic handling of\nalien races and customs. So is life in many parts of this island. The\nfact is that the process of learning to govern these alien peoples is\nthe best education in the world. The Indian Civil Service is a great\nCollege, and it governs India. I can speak to this point, for I have\nlived there and seen it at work. If India were really governed by the\nideas of the young novices who go out there fresh from their\nexaminations, she would be a distressful country. But the novice is\ntaken in hand at once by the older members of the service; he works\nunder the eye of the Collector and the Assistant Collector; they\nshoulder him and instruct him as tame elephants shoulder and instruct\nthe wild; they are kind to him, and he lives in their company while his\nprejudices and follies peel off him; so that within a few years he\nbecomes a tolerant, wise, and devoted civil servant, who speaks the\nlanguage of the College and is proud to belong to it. The success of the\nGovernment of India is not to be credited to the classes from which the\nCivil Service is recruited, but to the discipline of the Service itself,\na Service so high in tradition and so free from corruption that\nadvancement in it is to be gained only by intelligence and sympathy.\nWhat I am saying is that I can imagine no finer raw material for the\npolitical discipline of the Indian Civil Service than some of the\ngenerous and clean-run spirits who have come from the Dominions to help\nin this war. They could be introduced to a share of our responsibilities\nwithout impeding or retarding the movement to give to selected natives\nof India a larger share in the government of their country.",
        "But the war is not over, so I return to the main issue–the conflict\nbetween the English idea and the German idea of world government. It is\nnot an accident, as Baron von Hügel remarks in his book on The German\nSoul, that the chief colonizing nation of the world should be a nation\nwithout a national army. We have depended enormously in the past on the\ninitiative and virtue of the individual adventurer; if our adventurers\nwere to fail us, which is not likely, or if the State were to supersede\nthem, and attempt to do their work, which is not conceivable, our\npolitical power and influence would vanish with them. The world might\nperhaps be well ordered, but there would be no freedom, and no fun. The\nbeauty of the adventurer is that he is practically invincible. He does\nnot wait for orders. Under the most perfect police system that Germany\ncould devise, he would be up and at it again. We are not so numerous as\nthe Germans, but there are enough and to spare of us to make German\ngovernment impossible in any place where we pitch our tents. We are\npractised hands at upsetting governments. Our political system is a\ntraining school for rebels. This is what makes our very existence an\noffence to the moral instincts of the German people. They are quite\nright to want to kill us; the only way to abolish fun and freedom is to\nabolish life. But I must not be unjust to them; their forethought\nprovides for everything, and no doubt they would prescribe authorized\nforms of fun for half an hour a week, and would gather together their\nsubjects in public assembly, under municipal regulations, to perform\napproved exercises in freedom.",
        "Mankind lives by ideas; and if an irreconcilable difference in ideas\nmakes a good war, then this is a good war. The contrast between the two\nideas is profound and far-reaching. My business lies in a University.\nFor a good many years before the war certain selected German students,\nwho had had a University education in their own country, came as Rhodes\nscholars to Oxford. The intention of Mr. Rhodes was benevolent; he\nthought that if German students were to reside for four years at Oxford\nand to associate there, at an impressionable time of life, with young\nEnglishmen, understanding and fellowship would be encouraged between the\ntwo peoples. But the German government took care to defeat Mr. Rhodes’s\nintention. Instead of sending a small number of students for the full\nperiod, as Mr. Rhodes had provided, Germany asked and (by whose mistake\nI do not know) obtained leave to send a larger number for a shorter\nstay. The students selected were intended for the political and\ndiplomatic service, and were older than the usual run of Oxford\nfreshmen. Their behaviour had a certain ambassadorial flavour about it.\nThey did not mix much in the many undergraduate societies which flourish\nin a college, but met together in clubs of their own to drink patriotic\ntoasts. They were nothing if not superior. I remember a conversation I\nhad with one of them who came to consult me. He wished, he said, to do\nsome definite piece of research work in English literature. I asked him\nwhat problems or questions in English literature most interested him,\nand he replied that he would do anything that I advised. We had a talk\nof some length, wholly at cross-purposes. At last I tried to make my\npoint of view clear by reminding him that research means finding the\nanswer to a question, and that if his reading of English literature,\nwhich had been fairly extensive, had suggested no questions to his mind,\nhe was not in the happiest possible position to begin research. This\ntouched his national pride, and he gave me something not unlike a\nlecture. In Germany, he said, the professor tells you what you are to\ndo; he gives you a subject for investigation, he names the books you are\nto read, and advises you on what you are to write; you follow his\nadvice, and produce a thesis, which gains you the degree of Doctor of\nLetters. I have seen a good many of these theses, and I am sure this\naccount is correct. With very rare exceptions they are as dead as\nmutton, and much less nourishing. The upshot of our conversation was\nthat he thought me an incompetent professor, and I thought him an\nunprofitable student.",
        "There are many people in England to-day who praise the thoroughness of\nthe Germans, and their devotion to systematic thought. Has any one ever\ntaken the trouble to trace the development of the thesis habit, and its\ninfluence on their national life? They theorize everything, and they\nbelieve in their theories. They have solemn theories of the English\ncharacter, of the French character, of the nature of war, of the history\nof the world. No breath of scepticism dims their complacency, although\nevents steadily prove their theories wrong. They have courage, and when\nthey are seeking truth by the process of reasoning, they accept the\nconclusions attained by the process, however monstrous these conclusions\nmay be. They not only accept them, they act upon them, and, as every one\nknows, their behaviour in Belgium was dictated to them by their\nphilosophy.",
        "Thought of this kind is the enemy of the human race. It intoxicates\nsluggish minds, to whom thought is not natural. It suppresses all the\ngentler instincts of the heart and supplies a basis of orthodoxy for all\nthe cruelty and treachery in the world. I do not know, none of us knows,\nwhen or how this war will end. But I know that it is worth fighting to\nthe end, whatever it may cost to all and each of us. We may have peace\nwith the Germans, the peace of exhaustion or the peace that is only a\nbreathing space in a long struggle. We can never have peace with the\nGerman idea. It was not the idea of the older German thinkers–of Kant,\nor of Goethe, who were good Europeans. Kant said that there is nothing\ngood in the world except the good will. The modern German doctrine is\nthat there is nothing good in the world except what tends to the power\nand glory of the State. The inventor of this doctrine, it may be\nremembered, was the Devil, who offered to the Son of Man the glory of\nall the kingdoms of the world, if only He would fall down and worship\nhim. The Germans, exposed to a like temptation, have accepted the offer\nand have fulfilled the condition. They can have no assurance that faith\nwill be kept with them. On the other hand, we can have no assurance that\nthey will suffer any signal or dramatic reverse. Human history does not\nusually observe the laws of melodrama. But we know that their newly\npurchased doctrine can be fought, in war and in peace, and we know that\nin the end it will not prevail.",
        "An Address to the Union Society of University College, London, March\n22,1917\nWhen Professor W.P. Ker asked me to address you on this ceremonial\noccasion I felt none of the confidence of the man who knows what he\nwants to say, and is looking for an audience. But Professor Ker is my\nold friend, and this place is the place where I picked up many of those\nfragmentary impressions which I suppose must be called my education. So\nI thought it would be ungrateful to refuse, even though it should prove\nthat I have nothing to express save goodwill and the affections of\nmemory.",
        "When I matriculated in the University of London and became a student in\nthis place, my professors were Professor Goodwin, Professor Church,\nProfessor Henrici, Professor Groom Robertson, and Professor Henry\nMorley. I remember all these, though, if they were alive, I do not think\nthat any of them would remember me. The indescribable exhilaration,\nwhich must be familiar to many of you, of leaving school and entering\ncollege, is in great part the exhilaration of making acquaintance with\nteachers who care much about their subject and little or nothing about\ntheir pupils. To escape from the eternal personal judgements which make\na school a place of torment is to walk upon air. The schoolmaster looks\nat you; the college professor looks the way you are looking. The\nstatements made by Euclid, that thoughtful Greek, are no longer\nencumbered at college with all those preposterous and irrelevant moral\nconsiderations which desolate the atmosphere of a school. The question\nnow is not whether you have perfectly acquainted yourself with what\nEuclid said, but whether what he said is true. In my earliest days at\ncollege I heard a complete exposition of the first six books of Euclid,\ngiven in four lectures, with masterly ease and freedom, by Professor\nHenrici, who did not hesitate to employ methods of demonstration which,\nthough they are perfectly legitimate and convincing, were rejected by\nthe daintiness of the Greek. Professor Groom Robertson introduced his\npupils to the mysteries of mental and moral philosophy, and incidentally\ndisaffected some of us by what seemed to us his excessive reverence for\nthe works of Alexander Bain. Those works were our favourite theme for\nsatirical verse, which we did not pain our Professor by publishing.\nProfessor Henry Morley lectured hour after hour to successive classes in\na room half way down the passage, on the left. Even overwork could not\ndeaden his enormous vitality; but I hope that his immediate successor\ndoes not lecture so often. Outside the classrooms I remember the\npassages, which resembled the cellars of an unsuccessful sculptor, the\nlibrary, where I first read Romeo and Juliet, and the refectory, where\nwe discussed human life in most, if not in all, of its aspects. In the\nneighbourhood of the College there was the classic severity of Gower\nStreet, and, for those who preferred the richer variety of romance,\nthere was always the Tottenham Court Road. Beyond all, and throughout\nall, there was friendship, and there was freedom. The College was\nfounded, I believe, partly in the interests of those who object to\nsubscribe to a conclusion before they are permitted to examine the\ngrounds for it. It has always been a free place; and if I remember it as\na place of delight, that is because I found here the delights of\nfreedom.",
        "My thoughts in these days are never very long away from the War, so that\nI should feel it difficult to speak of anything else. Yet there are so\nmany ways in which it would be unprofitable for me to pretend to speak\nof it, that the difficulty remains. I have no knowledge of military or\nnaval strategy. I am not intimately acquainted with Germany or with\nGerman culture. I could praise our own people, and our own fighting men,\nfrom a full heart; but that, I think, is not exactly what you want from\nme. So I am reduced to attempting what we have all had to attempt during\nthe past two years or more, to try to state, for myself as much as for\nyou, the meaning of this War so far as we can perceive it.",
        "It seems to be a decree of fate that this country shall be compelled\nevery hundred years to fight for her very life. We live in an island\nthat lies across the mouths of the Rhine, and guards the access to all\nthe ports of northern Europe. In this island we have had enough safety\nand enough leisure to develop for ourselves a system of constitutional\nand individual liberty which has had an enormous influence on other\nnations. It has been admired and imitated; it has also been hated and\nattacked. To the majority of European statesmen and politicians it has\nbeen merely unintelligible. Some of them have regarded it with a kind\nof superstitious reverence; for we have been very successful in the\nworld at large, and how could so foolish and ineffective a system\nachieve success except by adventitious aid? Others, including all the\nstatesmen and political theorists who prepared Germany for this War,\nhave refused to admire; the power of England, they have taught, is not\nreal power; she has been crafty and lucky; she has kept herself free\nfrom the entanglements and strifes of the Continent, and has enriched\nherself by filching the property of the combatants. If once she were\ncompelled to hold by force what she won by guile, her pretensions would\ncollapse, and she would fall back into her natural position as a small\nagricultural island, inhabited by a people whose proudest boast would\nthen be that they are poor cousins of the Germans.",
        "It is difficult to discuss this question with German professors and\npoliticians: they have such simple minds, and they talk like angry\nchildren. Their opinions concerning England are not original; their\nviews were held with equal fervour and expressed in very similar\nlanguage by Philip of Spain in the sixteenth century, by Louis XIV of\nFrance in the seventeenth century, and by Napoleon at the close of the\neighteenth century. ’These all died in faith, not having received the\npromises, but having seen them afar off.’ I will ask you to consider the\nattack made upon England by each of these three powerful rulers.",
        "Any one who reads the history of these three great wars will feel a\nsense of illusion, as if he were reading the history of to-day. The\npoints of resemblance in all four wars are so many and so great that it\nseems as if the four wars were all one war, repeated every century. The\ncause of the war is always an ambitious ruler who covets supremacy on\nthe European Continent. England is always opposed to him–inevitably and\ninstinctively. It took the Germans twenty years to prepare their people\nfor this War. It took us two days to prepare ours. Our instinct is quick\nand sound; for the resources and wealth of the Continent, if once they\nwere controlled by a single autocratic power, would make it impossible\nfor England to follow her fortunes upon the sea. But we never stand\nquite alone. The smaller peoples of the Continent, who desire\nself-government, or have achieved it, always give the conqueror trouble,\nand rebel against him or resist him. England always sends help to them,\nthe help of an expeditionary force, or, failing that, the help of\nirregular volunteers. Sir Philip Sidney dies at Zutphen; Sir John Moore\nat Corunna. There is always desperate fighting in the Low Countries; and\nthe names of Mons, Liège, Namur, and Lille recur again and again.\nEngland always succeeds in maintaining herself, though not without some\nreverses, on the sea. In the end the power of the master of legions,\nPhilip, Louis, Napoleon, and shall we say William, crumbles and melts;\nhis ambitions are too costly to endure, his people chafe under his lash,\nand his kingdom falls into insignificance or is transformed by internal\nrevolution.",
        "In all these wars there is one other resemblance which it is good to\nremember to-day. The position of England, at one time or another in the\ncourse of the war, always seems desperate. When Philip of Spain invaded\nEngland with the greatest navy of the world, he was met on the seas by a\nfleet made up chiefly of volunteers. When Louis overshadowed Europe and\nthreatened England, our king was in his pay and had made a secret treaty\nwith him; our statesmen, moreover, had destroyed our alliance with the\nmaritime powers of Sweden and Holland, we had war with the Dutch, and\nour fleet was beaten by them. During the war against Napoleon we were in\nan even worse plight; the plausible political doctrines of the\nRevolution found many sympathizers in this country; our sailors mutinied\nat the Nore; Ireland was aflame with discontent; and we were involved in\nthe Mahratta War in India, not to mention the naval war with America.\nEven after Trafalgar, our European allies failed us, Napoleon disposed\nof Austria and Prussia, and concluded a separate treaty with Russia. It\nwas then that Wordsworth wrote–",
        "  ’’Tis well! from this day forward we shall know\n  That in ourselves our safety must be sought;\n  That by our own right hands it must be wrought;\n  That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.\n  O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!\n  We shall exult, if they who rule the land\n  Be men who hold its many blessings dear,\n  Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,\n  Who are to judge of dangers which they fear,\n  And honour which they do not understand.’",
        "Always in the same cause, we have suffered worse things than we are\nsuffering to-day, and if there is worse to come we hope that we are\nready. The youngest and best of us, who carry on and go through with\nit, though many of them are dead and many more will not live to see the\nday of victory, have been easily the happiest and most confident among\nus. They have believed that, at a price, they can save decency and\ncivilization in Europe, and, if they are wrong, they have known, as we\nknow, that the day when decency and civilization are trampled under the\nfoot of the brute is a day when it is good to die.",
        "When I speak of the German nation as the brute I am not speaking\ncontroversially or rhetorically; the whole German nation has given its\nhearty assent to a brutal doctrine of war and politics; no facts need be\ndisputed between us: what to us is their shame, to them is their glory.\nThis is a grave difference; yet it would be wrong to suppose that we can\ntreat it adequately by condemning the whole German nation as a nation of\nconfessed criminals. It is the paradox of war that there is always right\non both sides. When a man is ready and willing to sacrifice his life,\nyou cannot deny him the right to choose what he will die for. The most\nbeautiful virtues, faith and courage and devotion, grow like weeds upon\nthe battle-field. The fighters recognize these virtues in each other,\nand the front lines, for all their mud and slaughter, are breathed on by\nthe airs of heaven. Hate and pusillanimity have little there to nourish\nthem. To find the meaner passions you must seek further back. Johnson,\nspeaking in the Idler of the calamities produced by war, admits that\nhe does not know ’whether more is to be dreaded from streets filled with\nsoldiers accustomed to plunder, or from garrets filled with scribblers\naccustomed to lie’. Now that our army is the nation in arms, the danger\nfrom a lawless soldiery has become less, or has vanished; but the other\ndanger has increased. Journalists are not the only offenders. It is a\nstrange, squalid background for the nobility of the soldier that is made\nby the deceits and boasts of diplomatists and statesmen. In one of the\nprison camps of England, some weeks ago, I saw a Saxon boy who had\nfought bravely for his country. Simplicity and openness and loyalty were\nwritten on his face. There are hundreds like him, and I would not\nmention him if it were not that that same day I read with a new and\nheightened sense of disgust a speech by the German Chancellor, writhing\nwith timidity and dishonesty and uneasy braggadocio. Those who feel this\ncontrast as I did may be excused, I think, if they come to the\nconclusion that to talk about war is an accursed trade, and that to\nfight well, whether on the one side or the other, is the only noble\npart.",
        "Yet there is no escape for us; if we are to avoid chaos, if the daily\nlife of the world is to be re-established and carried on, there must be\nan understanding between nations, and there is no possible way to come\nto an understanding save by the action and words of representative men\non the one side and the other. Such representative men there are; there\nis no reason to doubt that they do in the main truly express the\naspirations and wishes of their people, and on both sides they have\neither explicitly or virtually made offers. The offer of the Allied\nPowers is on record. What does Germany offer? She has refused to make a\ndefinite statement, but her rulers have talked a great deal, and what\nshe intends is not really in doubt; only she is not sure whether she can\nget it, and still clings to the hope that a favourable turn of events\nmay relieve her of the duty of making proposals, and put her in a\nposition to dictate a settlement. We all know what that settlement would\nbe.",
        "The German offer for a solution of the problem of world-government is\nGerman sentiments, German racial pride, German manners and customs, an\nimmense increase of German territory and German influence, and above all\nan acknowledged supremacy for the German race among the nations of the\nworld. She thinks she has not stated these aims in so many words; but\nshe has. When it was suggested that the future peace of the world might\nbe assured by the formation of a League to Enforce Peace, Germany,\nthrough her official spokesmen, expressed her sympathy with that idea,\nand stated that she would very gladly put herself at the head of such a\nLeague. I can hardly help loving the Germans when their rustic\nsimplicity and rustic cunning lead them all unconsciously into\nself-revelation. The very idea of a League to Enforce Peace implies\nequality among the contracting parties; and Germany does not understand\nequality. ’By all means’, she says,’let us sit at a round table, and I\nwill sit at the top of it.’ Her panacea for human ills is Germanism. She\nhas nothing to offer but a purely national sentiment, which some,\ngreatly privileged, may share, and the rest must revere and bow to. In\nthe Book of Genesis we are told how Joseph was thrown into a pit by his\nelder brothers for talking just like this; but he meant it quite\ninnocently, and so do the Germans. They do not intend irreverence to God\nwhen they call Him the good German God. On the contrary, they choose for\nHis praise a word that to them stands for all goodness and all\ngreatness. Their worship expresses itself naturally in the tribal ritual\nand the tribal creed. This tribal creed, there can be no doubt, is what\nthey offer us for a talisman to ensure the right ordering of the world.",
        "Patriotism and loyalty to hearth and home are passions so strong in\nhumanity that a creed like this, when men are under its influence, is\nnot easily seen to be absurd. The Saxon boy, whom I saw in his prison\ncamp, probably would not quarrel with it. And even in the wider world of\nthought the illusions of nationalism are all-pervading. I once heard\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick remark that it is not easy for us to understand\nhow the troops of Portugal are stirred to heroic effort when their\ncommanders call on them to remember that they are Portuguese. He would\nno doubt have been the first to admit, for he had an alert and sceptical\nmind, that it is only our stupidity which finds anything comic in such\nan appeal. But it is stupidity of this kind which unfits men to deal\nwith other races, and it is stupidity of this kind which has been\nexalted by the Germans as a primal duty, and has, indeed, been advanced\nby them as their principal claim to undertake the government of the\nworld.",
        "This extreme nationalism, this unwillingness to feel any sympathy for\nother peoples, or to show them any consideration, has stupefied and\nblinded the Germans. One of the heaviest charges that can be brought\nagainst them is that they have seen no virtue in France, I do not ask\nthat they shall interrupt the War to express admiration for their\nenemies: I am speaking of the time before the War. France is the chief\nmodern inheritor of that great Roman civilization which found us painted\nsavages, and made us into citizens of the world. The French mind, it is\nadmitted, and admitted most readily by the most intelligent men, is\nquick and delicate and perceptive, surer and clearer in its operation\nthan the average European mind. Yet the Germans, infatuated with a\nbelief in their own numbers and their own brute strength, have dared to\nexpress contempt for the genius of France. A contempt for foreigners is\ncommon enough among the vulgar and unthinking of all nations, but I do\nnot believe that you will find anywhere but in Germany a large number of\nmen trained in the learned professions who are so besotted by vanity as\nto deny to France her place in the vanguard of civilization. These louts\ncannot be informed or argued with; they are interested in no one but\nthemselves, and naked self-assertion is their only idea of political\nargument. Treitschke, who was for twenty years Professor of History at\nBerlin, and who did perhaps more than any other man to build up the\nmodern German creed, has crystallized German politics in a single\nsentence. ’War’, he says, ’is politics par excellence,’ that is to\nsay, politics at their purest and highest. Our political doctrine, if it\nmust be put in as brief a form, would be better expressed in the\nsentence, ’War is the failure of politics’.",
        "If England were given over to nationalism as Germany is given over,\nthen a war between these two Powers, though it would still be a great\ndramatic spectacle, would have as little meaning as a duel between two\nrival gamebirds in a cockpit. We know, and it will some day dawn on the\nGermans, that this War has a deeper meaning than that. We are not\nnationalist; we are too deeply experienced in politics to stumble into\nthat trap. We have had a better and longer political education than has\ncome to Germany in her short and feverish national life. It is often\nsaid that the Germans are better educated than we are, and in a sense\nthat is true; they are better furnished with schools and colleges and\nthe public means of education. The best boy in a school is the boy who\nbest minds his book, and even if he dutifully believes all that it tells\nhim, that will not lose him the prize. When he leaves school and\ngraduates in a wider world, where men must depend on their own judgement\nand their own energy, he is often a little disconcerted to find that\nsome of his less bookish fellows easily outgo him in quickness of\nunderstanding and resource. German education is too elaborate; it\nattempts to do for its pupils much that they had better be left to do\nfor themselves. The pupils are docile and obedient, not troubled with\nunruly doubts and questionings, so that the German system of public\neducation is a system of public mesmerism, and, now that we see it in\nits effects, may be truly described as a national disease.",
        "I have said that England is not nationalist. If the English believed in\nEngland as the Germans believe in Germany, there would be nothing for\nit but a duel to the death, the extinction of one people or the other,\nand darkness as the burier of the dead. Peace would be attained by a\ngreat simplification and impoverishment of the world. But the English do\nnot believe in themselves in that mad-bull fashion. They come of mixed\nblood, and have been accustomed for many long centuries to settle their\ndifferences by compromise and mutual accommodation. They do not inquire\ntoo curiously into a man’s descent if he shares their ideas. They have\nshown again and again that they prefer a tolerant and intelligent\nforeigner to rule over them rather than an obstinate and wrong-headed\nman of native origin. The earliest strong union of the various parts of\nEngland was achieved by William the Norman, a man of French and\nScandinavian descent. Our native-born king, Charles the First, was put\nto death by his people; his son, James the Second, was banished, and the\nDutchman, William the Third, who had proved himself a statesman and\nsoldier of genius in his opposition to Louis the Fourteenth, was elected\nto the throne of England. The fierce struggles of the seventeenth\ncentury, between Royalists and Parliamentarians, between Cavaliers and\nPuritans, were settled at last, not by the destruction of either party,\nbut by the stereotyping of the dispute in the milder and more tolerable\nshape of the party system. The only people we have ever shown ourselves\nunwilling to tolerate are the people who will tolerate no one but their\nown kind. We hate all Acts of Uniformity with a deadly hatred. We are\ncareful for the rights of minorities. We think life should be made\npossible, and we do not object to its being made happy, for dissenters.\nVoltaire, the acutest French mind of his age, remarked on this when he\nvisited England in 1726. ’England’, he says, ’is the country of sects.\n\"In my father’s house are many mansions”.... Although the Episcopalians\nand the Presbyterians are the two dominant sects in Great Britain, all\nthe others are welcomed there, and live together very fairly, whilst\nmost of the preachers hate one another almost as cordially as a\nJansenist damns a Jesuit. Enter the London Exchange, a place much more\nworthy of respect than most Courts, and you see assembled for the\nbenefit of mankind representatives of all nations. There the Jew, the\nMohammedan, and the Christian deal with each other as if they were of\nthe same religion, and call infidels only those who become bankrupt.\nThere the Presbyterian trusts the Anabaptist, and the Anabaptist relies\non the promise of the Quaker. On leaving these free and peaceful\nassemblies, some proceed to the synagogue, others to the tavern.... If\nin England there were only one religion, its despotism would be to be\ndreaded; if there were only two, their followers would cut each other’s\nthroats; but there are thirty of them, and they live in peace and\nhappiness.’",
        "Since we have had so much practice in tolerating one another, and in\nliving together even when our ideas on life and the conduct of life seem\nabsolutely incompatible, it is no wonder that we approach the treatment\nof international affairs in a temper very unlike the solemn and dogmatic\nferocity of the German. We do not expect or desire that other peoples\nshall resemble us. The world is wide; and the world-drama is enriched\nby multiplicity and diversity of character. We like bad men, if there is\nsalt and spirit in their badness. We even admire a brute, if he is a\nwhole-hearted brute. I have often thought that if the Germans had been\ntrue to their principles and their programme–if, after proclaiming that\nthey meant to win by sheer strength and that they recognized no other\nright, they had continued as they began, and had battered and hacked,\nburned and killed, without fear or pity, a certain reluctant admiration\nfor them might have been felt in this country. There is no chance of\nthat now, since they took to whining about humanity. Yet it is very\ndifficult wholly to alienate the sympathies of the English people. It is\nperhaps in some ways a weakness, as it is certainly in other ways a\nstrength, that we are fanciers of other peoples. Our soldiers have a\ntendency to make pets of their prisoners, to cherish them as curiosities\nand souvenirs. The fancy becomes a passion when we find a little fellow\nstruggling valiantly against odds. I suppose we should be at war with\nGermany to-day, even if the Germans had respected the neutrality of\nBelgium. But the unprovoked assault upon a little people that asked only\nto be let alone united all opinions in this country and brought us in\nwith a rush. I believe there is one German, at least (I hope he is\nalive), who understands this. Early in July, 1914, a German student at\nOxford, who was a friend and pupil of mine, came to say good-bye to me.\nI have since wondered whether he was under orders to join his regiment.\nAnyhow, we talked very freely of many things, and he told me of an\nadventure that had befallen him in an Oxford picture-palace. Portraits\nof notabilities were being thrown on the screen. When a portrait of the\nGerman Emperor appeared, a youth, sitting just behind my friend, shouted\nout an insulting and scurrilous remark. So my friend stood up and turned\nround and, catching him a cuff on the head, said,’That’s my emperor’.\nThe house was full of undergraduates, and he expected to be seized and\nthrown into the street. To his great surprise the undergraduates, many\nof whom have now fallen on the fields of France, broke into rounds of\ncheering. ’I should like to think’, my friend said, ’that a thing like\nthat could possibly happen in a German city, but I am afraid that the\nfeeling there would always be against the foreigner. I admire the\nEnglish; they are so just.’ I have heard nothing of him since, except a\nrumour that he is with the German army of occupation in Belgium. If so,\nI like to think of him at a regimental mess, suggesting doubts, or, if\nthat is an impossible breach of military discipline, keeping silence,\nwhen the loud-voiced major explains that the sympathy of the English for\nBelgium is all pretence and cant.",
        "Ideal and disinterested motives are always to be reckoned with in human\nnature. What the Germans call ’real politics’, that is to say, politics\nwhich treat disinterested motives as negligible, have led them into a\nmorass and have bogged them there. How easy it is to explain that the\nBritish Empire depends on trade, that we are a nation of traders, that\nall our policy is shaped by trade, that therefore it can only be\nhypocrisy in us to pretend to any of the finer feelings. This is not,\nas you might suppose, the harmless sally of a one-eyed wit; it is the\ncarefully reasoned belief of Germany’s profoundest political thinkers.\nThey do not understand a cavalier, so they confidently assert that there\nis no such thing in nature. That is a bad mistake to make about any\nnation, but perhaps worst when it is made about the English, for the\ncavalier temper in England runs through all classes. You can find it in\nthe schoolmaster, the small trader, the clerk, and the labourer, as\nreadily as in the officer of dragoons, or the Arctic explorer. The\nRoundheads won the Civil War, and bequeathed to us their political\nachievements. From the Cavaliers we have a more intimate bequest: it is\nfrom them, not from the Puritans, that the fighting forces of the\nBritish Empire inherit their outlook on the world, their freedom from\npedantry, and that gaiety and lightness of courage which makes them\ncarry their lives like a feather in the cap.",
        "I am not saying that our qualities, good or bad, commend us very readily\nto strangers. The people of England, on the whole, are respected more\nthan they are liked. When I call them fanciers of other nations, I feel\nit only fair to add that some of those other nations express the same\ntruth in different language. I have often heard the complaint made that\nEnglishmen cannot speak of foreigners without an air of patronage. It is\nimpossible to deny this charge, for, in a question of manners, the\nimpressions you produce are your manners; and there is no doubt about\nthis impression. There is a certain coldness about the upright and\nhumane Englishman which repels and intimidates any trivial human being\nwho approaches him. Most men would forgo their claim to justice for the\nchance of being liked. They would rather have their heads broken, or\naccept a bribe, than be the objects of a dispassionate judgement,\nhowever kindly. They feel this so strongly that they experience a dull\ndiscomfort in any relationship that is not tinctured with passion. As\nthere are many such relationships, not to be avoided even by the most\nemotional natures, they escape from them by simulating lively feeling,\nand are sometimes exaggerated and insincere in manner. They issue a very\nlarge paper currency on a very small gold reserve. This, which is\ncommonly known as the Irish Question, is an insoluble problem, for it is\na clash not of interests but of temperaments. The English, it must in\nfairness be admitted, do as they would be done by. No Englishman pure\nand simple is incommoded by the coldness of strangers. He prefers it,\nfor there are many stupid little businesses in the world, which are\nfalsified when they are made much of; and even when important facts are\nto be told, he would rather have them told in a dreary manner. He hates\na fuss.",
        "The Germans, who are a highly emotional and excitable people, have\nconcentrated all their energy on a few simple ideas. Their moral outlook\nis as narrow as their geographical outlook is wide. Will their faith\nprevail by its intensity, narrow and false though it be? I cannot prove\nthat it will not, but I have a suspicion, which I think has already\noccurred to some of them, that the world is too large and wilful and\nstrong to be mastered by them. We have seen what their hatchets and\nexplosives can do, and they are nearing the end of their resources. They\ncan still repeat some of their old exploits, but they make no headway,\nand time is not their friend.",
        "One service, perhaps, they have done to civilization. There is a growing\nnumber of people who hold that when this War is over international\nrelations must not be permitted to slip back into the unstable condition\nwhich tempted the Germans to their crime. A good many pacific theorists,\nno doubt, have not the experience and the imagination which would enable\nthem to pass a useful judgement, or to make a valuable suggestion, on\nthe affairs of nations. The abolition of war would be easily obtained if\nit were generally agreed that war is the worst thing that can befall a\npeople. But this is not generally agreed; and, further, it is not true.\nWhile men are men they cannot be sure that they will never be challenged\non a point of deep and intimate concern, where they would rather die\nthan yield. But something can perhaps be done to discourage gamblers’\nwars, though even here any stockbroker will tell you how difficult it is\nto suppress gambling without injuring the spirit of enterprise. The only\nreal check on war is an understanding between nations. For the\nstrengthening of such an understanding the Allies have a great\nopportunity, and admirable instruments. I do not think that we shall\ncall on Germany to preside at our conferences. But we shall have the\nhelp of all those qualities of heart and mind which are possessed by\nFrance, by Russia, by Italy, and by America, who, for all her caution,\nhates cruelty even more than she loves peace. There has never been an\nalliance of greater promise for the government and peace of the world.",
        "What is the contribution of the British Empire, and of England, towards\nthis settlement? Many of our domestic problems, as I have said, bear a\ncurious resemblance to international problems. We have not solved them\nall. We have had many stumblings and many backslidings. But we have\nshown again and again that we believe in toleration on the widest\npossible basis, and that we are capable of generosity, which is a virtue\nmuch more commonly shown by private persons than by communities. We\nabolished the slave trade. We granted self-government to South Africa\njust after our war with her. Only a few days ago we gave India her will,\nand allowed her to impose a duty on our manufactures. Ireland could have\nself-government to-morrow if she did not value her feuds more than\nanything else in the world. All these are peoples to whom we have been\nbound by ties of kinship or trusteeship. A wider and greater opportunity\nis on its way to us. We are to see whether we are capable of generosity\nand trust towards peoples who are neither our kin nor our wards. Our\nunderstanding with France and Russia will call for great goodwill on\nboth sides, not so much in the drafting of formal treaties as in\nindulging one another in our national habits. Families who fail to live\ntogether in unity commonly fail not because they quarrel about large\ninterests, but because they do not like each other’s little ways. The\nFrench are not a dull people; and the Russians are not a tedious people\n(what they do they do suddenly, without explanation); so that if we\nfail to take pleasure in them we have ourselves to blame. If we are not\nequal to our opportunities, if we do not learn to feel any affection for\nthem, then not all the pacts and congresses in the world can make peace\nsecure.",
        "Of Germany it is too early to speak. We have not yet defeated her. If we\ndo defeat her, no one who is acquainted with our temper and our record\nbelieves that we shall impose cruel or vindictive terms. If it were only\nthe engineers of this war who were in question, we would destroy them\ngladly as common pests. But the thing is not so easy. A single home is\nin many ways a greater and more appealing thing than a nation; we should\nfind ourselves thinking of the miseries of simple and ignorant people\nwho have given their all for the country of their birth; and our hearts\nwould fail us.",
        "The Germans would certainly despise this address of mine, for I have\ntalked only of morality, while they talk and think chiefly of machines.\nZeppelins are a sad disappointment; but if any address on the War is\nbeing delivered to-night by a German professor, there can be no doubt\nthat it deals with submarines, and treats them as the saviours of the\nFatherland. Well, I know very little about submarines, but I notice that\nthey have not had much success against ships of war. We are so\neasy-going that we expected to carry on our commerce in war very much as\nwe did in peace. We have to change all that, and it will cost us not a\nlittle inconvenience, or even great hardships. But I cannot believe that\na scheme of privy attacks on the traders of all nations, devised as a\nlast resort, in lieu of naval victory, can be successful when it is no\nlonger a surprise. And when I read history, I am strengthened in my\nbelief that morality is all-important. I do not find that any war\nbetween great nations was ever won by a machine. The Trojan horse will\nbe trotted out against me, but that was a municipal affair. Wars are won\nby the temper of a people. Serbia is not yet defeated. It is a frenzied\nand desperate quest that the Germans undertook when they began to seek\nfor some mechanical trick or dodge, some monstrous engine, which should\nenable the less resolved and more excited people to defeat the more\nresolved and less excited. If we are to be defeated, it must be by them,\nnot by their bogey-men. We got their measure on the Somme, and we found\nthat when their guns failed to protect them, many of them threw up their\nhands. These men will never be our masters until we deserve to be their\nslaves.",
        "So I am glad to be able to end on a note of agreement with the German\nmilitary party. If they defeat us, it will be no more than we deserve.\nTill then, or till they throw up their hands, we shall fight them, and\nGod will defend the right.",
        "An Address to the Royal Colonial Institute, February 13, 1918\nOur losses in this War continue to be enormous, and we are not yet near\nto the end. So it may seem absurd to speak of our gains, of gains that\nwe have already achieved. But if you will look at the thing in a large\nlight, I think you will see that it is not absurd.",
        "I do not speak of gains of territory, and prisoners, and booty. It is\ntrue that we have taken from the Germans about a million square miles of\nland in Africa, where land is cheap. We have taken more prisoners from\nthem than they have taken from us, and we have whole parks of German\nartillery to set over against the battered and broken remnants of\nBritish field-guns which were exhibited in Berlin–a monument to the\nimmortal valour of the little old Army. I am speaking rather of gains\nwhich cannot be counted as guns are counted, or measured as land is\nmeasured, but which are none the less real and important.",
        "The Germans have achieved certain great material gains in this War, and\nthey are fighting now to hold them. If they fail to hold them, the\nGermany of the war-lords is ruined. She will have to give up all her\nbloated ambitions, to purge and live cleanly, and painfully to\nreconstruct her prosperity on a quieter and sounder basis. She will not\ndo this until she is forced to it by defeat. No doubt there are moderate\nand sensible men in Germany, as in other countries; but in Germany they\nare without influence, and can do nothing. War is the national industry\nof Prussia; Prussia has knit together the several states of the larger\nGermany by means of war, and has promised them prosperity and power in\nthe future, to be achieved by war. You know the Prussian doctrine of\nwar. Every one now knows it. According to that doctrine it is a foolish\nthing for a nation to wait till it is attacked. It should carefully\ncalculate its own strength and the strength of its neighbours, and, when\nit is ready, it should attack them, on any pretext, suddenly, without\nwarning, and should take from them money and land. When it has gained\nterritory in this fashion, it should subject the population of the\nconquered territory to the strictest laws of military service, and so\nsupply itself with an instrument for new and bolder aggression. This is\nnot only the German doctrine; it is the German practice. In this way and\nno other modern Germany has been built up. It is a huge new State,\nfounded on force, cemented by fear, and financed on speculative gains to\nbe derived from the great gamble of war. You may have noticed that the\nGerman people have not been called on, as yet, to pay any considerable\nsum in taxation towards the expenses of this war. Those expenses (that,\nat least, was the original idea) were to be borne wholly by the\nconquered enemy. There are hundreds of thousands of Germans to-day who\nfirmly believe that their war-lords will return in triumph from the\nstricken field, bringing with them the spoils of war, and scattering a\nlargess of peace and plenty.",
        "To us it seems a marvel that any people should accept such a doctrine,\nand should willingly give their lives and their fortunes to the work of\ncarrying it out in practice; but it is not so marvellous as it seems.\nThe German peoples are brave and obedient, and so make good soldiers;\nthey are easily lured by the hope of profit; they are naturally\nattracted by the spectacular and sentimental side of war; above all,\nthey are so curiously stupid that many of them do actually believe that\nthey are a divinely chosen race, superior to the other races of the\nworld. They are very carefully educated, and their education, which is\nordered by the State, is part of the military machine. Their thinking is\ndone for them by officials. It would require an extraordinary degree of\ncourage and independence for a German youth to cut himself loose and\nbegin thinking and judging for himself. It must always be remembered,\nmoreover, that their recent history seems to justify their creed. I will\nnot go back to Frederick the Great, though the history of his wars is\nthe Prussian handbook, which teaches all the characteristic Prussian\nmethods of treachery and deceit. But consider only the last two German\nwars. How, in the face of these, can it be proved to any German that war\nis not the most profitable of adventures? In 1866 Prussia had war with\nAustria. The war lasted forty days, and Prussia had from five to six\nthousand soldiers killed in action. As a consequence of the war Prussia\ngained much territory, and established her control over the states of\ngreater Germany. In 1870 she had war with France. Her total casualties\nin that war were approximately a hundred thousand, just about the same\nas our casualties in Gallipoli. From the war she gained, besides a great\nincrease of strength at home, the rich provinces of Alsace and Lorraine,\nwith all their mineral wealth, and an indemnity of two hundred million\npounds, that is to say, four times the actual cost of the war in money.\nHow then can it be maintained that war is not good business? If you say\nso to any Prussian, he thinks you are talking like a child.",
        "Not only were these two wars rich in profit for the Germans, but they\ndid not lose them much esteem. There was sympathy in this country for\nthe union of the German peoples, just as there was sympathy, a few years\nearlier, for the union of the various states of Italy. There was not a\nlittle admiration for German efficiency and strength. So that Bismarck,\nwho was an expert in all the uses of bullying, blackmail, and fraud, was\naccepted as a great European statesman. I have always believed, and I\nstill believe, that Germany will have to pay a heavy price for\nBismarck–all the heavier because the payment has been so long deferred.",
        "The present War, then, is in the direct line of succession to these\nformer wars; it was planned by Germany, elaborately and deliberately\nplanned, on a calculation of the profits to be derived from operations\non a large scale.",
        "Well, as I said, we, as a people, do not believe in gambling in human\nmisery to attain uncertain speculative gains. We hold that war can be\njustified only by a good cause, not by a lucky event. The German\ndoctrine seems to us impious and wicked. Though we have defined our war\naims in detail, and the Germans have not dared publicly to define\ntheirs, our real and sufficient war aim is to break the monstrous and\ninhuman doctrine and practice of the enemy–to make their calculations\nmiscarry. And observe, if their calculations miscarry, they have fought\nand suffered for nothing. They entered into this War for profit, and in\nthe conduct of the War, though they have made many mistakes, they have\nmade none of those generous and magnanimous mistakes which redeem and\nbeautify a losing cause.",
        "The essence of our cause, and its greatest strength, is that we are not\nfighting for profit. We are fighting for no privilege except the\nprivilege of possessing our souls, of being ourselves–a privilege which\nwe claim also for other weaker nations. The inestimable strength of that\nposition is that if the odds are against us it does not matter. If you\nsee a ruffian torturing a child, and interfere to prevent him, do you\nfeel that your attempt was a wrong one because he knocks you down? And\nif you succeed, what material profit is there in saving a child from\ntorture? We have sometimes fought in the past for doubtful causes and\nfor wrong causes, but this time there is no mistake. Our cause is better\nthan we deserve; we embraced it by an act of faith, and it is only by\ncontinuing in that faith that we shall see it through. The little old\nArmy, when they went to France in August 1914, did not ask what profits\nwere likely to come their way. They knew that there were none, but they\nwere willing to sacrifice themselves to save decency and humanity from\nbeing trampled in the mud. This was the Army that the Germans called a\nmercenary Army, and its epitaph has been written by a good poet:",
        "     These, in the day when heaven was falling,\n     The hour when earth’s foundations fled,\n     Followed their mercenary calling,\n     And took their wages, and are dead.",
        "     Their shoulders held the heavens suspended,\n     They stood, and earth’s foundations stay,\n     What God abandoned these defended,\n     And saved the sum of things for pay.",
        "We must follow their example, for we shall never get a better. We must\nnot make too much of calculation, especially when it deals with\nincalculable things. Nervous public critics, like Mr. H.G. Wells, are\nalways calling out for more cleverness in our methods, for new and\neffective tricks, so that we may win the War. I would never disparage\ncleverness; the more you can get of it, the better; but it is useless\nunless it is in the service of something stronger and greater than\nitself, and that is character. Cleverness can grasp; it is only\ncharacter that can hold. The Duke of Wellington was not a clever man; he\nwas a man of simple and honourable mind, with an infinite capacity for\npatience, persistence, and endurance, so that neither unexpected\nreverses abroad nor a flood of idle criticism at home could shake him or\nchange him. So he bore a chief part in laying low the last great tyranny\nthat desolated Europe.",
        "None of our great wars was won by cleverness; they were all won by\nresolution and perseverance. In all of them we were near to despair and\ndid not despair. In all of them we won through to victory in the end.",
        "But in none of them did victory come in the expected shape. The worst of\nmaking elaborate plans of victory, and programmes of all that is to\nfollow victory, is that the mixed event is sure to defeat those plans.\nNot every war finds its decision in a single great battle. Think of our\nwar with Spain in the sixteenth century. Spain was then the greatest of\nEuropean Powers. She had larger armies than we could raise; she had\nmore than our wealth, and more than our shipping. The newly discovered\ncontinent of America was an appanage of Spain, and her great galleons\nwere wafted lazily to and fro, bringing her all the treasures of the\nwestern hemisphere. We defeated her by standing out and holding on. We\nfought her in the Low Countries, which she enslaved and oppressed. We\nrefused to recognize her exclusive rights in America, and our merchant\nseamen kept the sea undaunted, as they have kept it for the last three\nyears. When at last we became an intolerable vexation to Spain, she\ncollected a great Armada, or war-fleet, to invade and destroy us; and it\nwas shattered, by the winds of heaven and the sailors of England, in\n1588. The defeat of the Armada was the turning-point of the war, but it\nwas not the end. It lifted a great shadow of fear from the hearts of the\npeople, as a great shadow of fear has already been lifted from their\nhearts in the present War, but during the years that followed we\nsuffered many and serious reverses at the hand of Spain, before peace\nand security were reached. So late as 1601, thirteen years after the\ndefeat of the Armada, the King of Denmark offered to mediate between\nEngland and Spain, so that the long and disastrous war might be ended.\nQueen Elizabeth was then old and frail, but this was what she said–and\nif you want to understand why she was almost adored by her people,\nlisten to her words: ’I would have the King of Denmark, and all Princes\nChristian and Heathen to know, that England hath no need to crave peace;\nnor myself endured one hour’s fear since I attained the crown thereof,\nbeing guarded with so valiant and faithful subjects.’ In the end the\npower and menace of Spain faded away, and when peace was made, in 1604,\nthis nation never again, from that day to this, feared the worst that\nSpain could do.",
        "What were our gains from the war with Spain? Freedom to live our lives\nin our own way, unthreatened; freedom to colonize America. The gains of\na great war are never visible immediately; they are deferred, and\nextended over many years. What did we gain by our war with Napoleon,\nwhich ended in the victory of Waterloo? For long years after Waterloo\nthis country was full of riots and discontents; there were\nrick-burnings, agitations, popular risings, and something very near to\nfamine in the land. But all these things, from a distance, are now seen\nto have been the broken water that follows the passage of a great storm.\nThe real gains of Waterloo, and still more of Trafalgar, are evident in\nthe enormous commercial and industrial development of England during the\nnineteenth century, and in the peaceful foundation of the great\ndominions of Canada, Australia, and South Africa, which was made\npossible only by our unchallenged use of the seas. The men who won those\ntwo great battles did not live to gather the fruits of their victory;\nbut their children did. If we defeat Germany as completely as we hope,\nwe shall not be able to point at once to our gains. But it is not a rash\nforecast to say that our children and children’s children will live in\ngreater security and freedom than we have ever tasted.",
        "A man must have a good and wide imagination if he is to be willing to\nface wounds and death for the sake of his unborn descendants and\nkinsfolk. We cannot count on the popular imagination being equal to the\ntask. Fortunately, there is a substitute for imagination which does the\nwork as well or better, and that is character. Our people are sound in\ninstinct; they understand a fight. They know that a wrestler who\nconsiders, while he is in the grip of his adversary, whether he would\nnot do well to give over, and so put an end to the weariness and the\nstrain, is no sort of a wrestler. They have never failed under a strain\nof this kind, and they will not fail now. The people who do the\nhalf-hearted and timid talking are either young egotists, who are angry\nat being deprived of their personal ease and independence; or elderly\npensive gentlemen, in public offices and clubs, who are no longer fit\nfor action, and, being denied action, fall into melancholy; or feverish\njournalists, who live on the proceeds of excitement, who feel the pulse\nand take the temperature of the War every morning, and then rush into\nthe street to announce their fluttering hopes and fears; or cosmopolitan\nphilosophers, to whom the change from London to Berlin means nothing but\na change in diet and a pleasant addition to their opportunities of\nhearing good music; or aliens in heart, to whom the historic fame of\nEngland, ’dear for her reputation through the world,’ is less than\nnothing; or practical jokers, who are calm and confident enough\nthemselves, but delight in startling and depressing others. These are\nnot the people of England; they are the parasites of the people of\nEngland. The people of England understand a fight.",
        "That brings me to the first great gain of the War. We have found\nourselves. Which of us, in the early months of 1914, would have dared\nto predict the splendours of the youth of this Empire–splendours which\nare now a part of our history? We are adepts at self-criticism and\nself-depreciation. We hate the language of emotion. Some of us, if we\nwere taken to heaven and asked what we thought of it, would say that it\nis decent, or not so bad. I suppose we are jealous to keep our standard\nhigh, and to have something to say if a better place should be found.\nBut in spite of all this, we do now know, and it is worth knowing, that\nwe are not weaker than our fathers. We know that the people who inhabit\nthese islands and this commonwealth of nations cannot be pushed on one\nside, or driven under, or denied a great share in the future ordering of\nthe world. We know this, and our knowledge of it is the debt that we owe\nto our dead. It is not vanity to admit that we know it; on the contrary,\nit would be vanity to pretend that we do not know it. It is visible to\nother eyes than ours. Some time ago I heard an address given by a friend\nof mine, an Indian Mohammedan of warrior descent, to University students\nof his own faith. He was urging on them the futility of dreams and the\nnecessity of self-discipline and self-devotion. ’Why do the people of\nthis country’, he said, ’count for so much all the world over? It is not\nbecause of their dreams; it is because thousands of them are lying at\nthe bottom of the sea.’",
        "Further, we have not only found ourselves; we have found one another. A\nnew kindliness has grown up, during the War, between people divided by\nthe barriers of class, or wealth, or circumstance. A statesman of the\nseventeenth century remarks that It is a Misfortune for a Man not to\nhave a Friend in the World, but for that reason he shall have no Enemy.\nI might invert his maxim and say, It is a Misfortune for a Man to have\nmany Enemies, but for that reason he shall know who are his Friends. No\nRadical member of Parliament will again, while any of us live, cast\ncontempt on ’the carpet Captains of Mayfair’. No idle Tory talker will\nagain dare to say that the working men of England care nothing for their\ncountry. Even the manners of railway travel have improved. I was\ntravelling in a third-class compartment of a crowded train the other\nday; we were twenty in the compartment, but it seemed a pity to leave\nany one behind, and we made room for number twenty-one. Nothing but a\nvery kindly human feeling could have packed us tight enough for this.\nYet now is the time that has been chosen by some of these pensive\ngentlemen that I spoke of, and by some of these excitable journalists,\nto threaten us with class-war, and to try to make our flesh creep by\nconjuring up the horrors of revolution. I advise them to take their\nopinions to the third-class compartment and discuss them there. It is a\ngood tribunal, for, sooner or later, you will find every one there–even\nofficers, when they are travelling in mufti at their own expense. I have\nvisited this tribunal very often, and I have always come away from it\nwith the same impression, that this people means to win the War. But I\ndo not travel much in the North of England, so I asked a friend of mine,\nwhose dealings are with the industrial North, what the workpeople of\nLancashire and Yorkshire think of the War. He said, ’Their view is very\nsimple: they mean to win it; and they mean to make as much money out of\nit as ever they can.’ Certainly, that is very simple; but before you\njudge them, put yourselves in their place. There are great outcries\nagainst profiteers, for making exorbitant profits out of the War, and\nagainst munition workers, for delaying work in order to get higher\nwages. I do not defend either of them; they are unimaginative and\nselfish, and I do not care how severely they are dealt with; but I do\nsay that the majority of them are not wicked in intention. A good many\nof the more innocent profiteers are men whose sin is that they take an\noffer of two shillings rather than an offer of eighteenpence for what\ncost them one and a penny. Some of us, in our weaker moments, might be\nbetrayed into doing the same. As for the munition workers, I remember\nwhat Goldsmith, who had known the bitterest poverty, wrote to his\nbrother. ’Avarice’, he said, ’in the lower orders of mankind is true\nambition; avarice is the only ladder the poor can use to preferment.\nPreach then, my dear Sir, to your son, not the excellence of human\nnature nor the disrespect of riches, but endeavour to teach him thrift\nand economy. Let his poor wandering uncle’s example be placed in his\neyes. I had learned from books to love virtue before I was taught from\nexperience the necessity of being selfish.’",
        "The profiteers and the munition workers are endeavouring, incidentally,\nto better their own position. But make no mistake; the bulk of these\npeople would rather die than allow one spire of English grass to be\ntrodden under the foot of a foreign trespasser. Their chief sin is that\nthey do not fear. They think that there is plenty of time to do a little\nbusiness for themselves on the way to defeat the enemy. I cannot help\nremembering the mutiny at the Nore, which broke out in our fleet during\nthe Napoleonic wars. The mutineers struck for more pay and better\ntreatment, but they agreed together that if the French fleet should put\nin an appearance during the mutiny, all their claims should be postponed\nfor a time, and the French fleet should have their first attention.",
        "Employers and employed do, no doubt, find in some trades to-day that\ntheir relations are strained and irksome. They would do well to take a\nlesson from the Army, where, with very few exceptions, there is harmony\nand understanding between those who take orders and those who give them.\nIt is only in the Army that you can see realized the ideal of ancient\nRome.",
        "     Then none was for a party,\n       Then all were for the State;\n     Then the great man helped the poor,\n       And the poor man loved the great.",
        "Why is the Army so far superior to most commercial and industrial\nbusinesses? The secret does not lie in State employment. There is plenty\nof discontent and unrest among the State-employed railway men and\nmunition workers. It lies rather in the habit of mutual help and mutual\ntrust. If any civilian employer of labour wants to have willing\nworkpeople, let him take a hint from the Army. Let him live with his\nworkpeople, and share all their dangers and discomforts. Let him take\nthought for their welfare before his own, and teach self-sacrifice by\nexample. Let him put the good of the nation before all private\ninterests; and those whom he commands will do for him anything that he\nasks.",
        "I cannot believe that the benefits which have come to us from the Army\nwill pass away with the passing of the War. Those who have been comrades\nin danger will surely take with them something of the old spirit into\ncivil life. And those who have kept clear of the Army in order to carry\non their own trades and businesses will surely realize that they have\nmissed the great opportunity of their lives.",
        "In a wider sense the War has brought us to an understanding of one\nanother. This great Commonwealth of independent nations which is called\nthe British Empire is scattered over the surface of the habitable globe.\nIt embraces people who live ten thousand miles apart, and whose ways of\nlife are so different that they might seem to have nothing in common.\nBut the War has brought them together, and has done more than half a\ncentury of peace could do to promote a common understanding. Hundreds of\nthousands of men of our blood who, before the War, had never seen this\nlittle island, have now made acquaintance with it. Hundreds of thousands\nof the inhabitants of this island to whom the Dominions were strange,\nfar places, if, after the War, they should be called on to settle there,\nwill not feel that they are leaving home. I can only hope that the\nCanadians and Anzacs think as well of us as we do of them. We do not\nlike to praise our friends in their hearing, so I will say no more than\nthis: I am told that a new kind of peerage, very haughty and very\nself-important, has arisen in South London. Its members are those\nhouse-holders who have been privileged to have Anzac soldiers billeted\non them. It is private ties of this kind, invisible to the\nconstitutional lawyer and the political historian, which make the fine\nmeshes of the web of Empire.",
        "Because he knew that the strength of the whole texture depends on the\nstrength of the fine meshes, Earl Grey, who died last year, will always\nbe remembered in our history. Not many men have his opportunity to make\nacquaintance with the domain that is their birthright, for he had\nadministered a province of South Africa, and had been Governor-General\nof Canada, He rediscovered the glory of the Empire, as poets rediscover\nthe glory of common speech. ’He had breathed its air,’ a friend of his\nsays, ’fished its rivers, walked in its valleys, stood on its mountains,\nmet its people face to face. He had seen it in all the zones of the\nworld. He knew what it meant to mankind. Under the British flag,\nwherever he journeyed, he found men of English speech living in an\natmosphere of liberty and carrying on the dear domestic traditions of\nthe British Isles. He saw justice firmly planted there, industry and\ninvention hard at work unfettered by tyrants of any kind, domestic life\nprospering in natural conditions, and our old English kindness and\ncheerfulness and broad-minded tolerance keeping things together. But he\nalso saw room under that same flag, ample room, for millions and\nmillions more of the human race. The Empire wasn’t a word to him. It was\na vast, an almost boundless, home for honest men.’",
        "The War did not dishearten him. When he died, in August, 1917, he said,\n’Here I lie on my death-bed, looking clear into the Promised Land. I’m\nnot allowed to enter it, but there it is before my eyes. After the War\nthe people of this country will enter it, and those who laughed at me\nfor a dreamer will see that I wasn’t so wrong after all. But there’s\nstill work to do for those who didn’t laugh, hard work, and with much\nopposition in the way; all the same, it is work right up against the\ngoal. My dreams have come true.’",
        "One of the clear gains of the War is to be found in the increased\nactivity and alertness of our own people. The motto of to-day is, ’Let\nthose now work who never worked before, And those who always worked now\nwork the more.’ Before the War we had a great national reputation for\nidleness–in this island, at least. I remember a friendly critic from\nCanada who, some five or six years ago, expressed to me, with much\ndisquiet, his opinion that there was something very far wrong with the\nold country; that we had gone soft. As for our German critics, they\nexpressed the same view in gross and unmistakable fashion. Wit is not a\nnative product in Germany, it all has to be imported, so they could not\nsatirize us; but their caricatures of the typical Englishman showed us\nwhat they thought. He was a young weakling with a foolish face, and was\ndressed in cricketing flannels. It would have been worth their while to\nnotice what they did not notice, that his muscles and nerves are not\nsoft. They learned that later, when the bank-clerks of Manchester broke\nthe Prussian Guard into fragments at Contalmaison. This must have been a\nsad surprise, for the Germans had always taught, in their delightful\nauthoritative fashion, that the chief industries of the young Englishman\nare lawn-tennis and afternoon tea. They are a fussy people, and they\nfind it difficult to understand the calm of the man who, having nothing\nto do, does it. Perhaps they were right, and we were too idle. The\ndisease was never so serious as they thought it, and now, thanks to\nthem, we are in a fair way to recovery. The idle classes have turned\ntheir hand to the lathe and the plough. Women are doing a hundred things\nthat they never did before, and are doing them well. The elasticity and\nresourcefulness that the War has developed will not be lost or destroyed\nby the coming of peace. Least of all will those qualities be lost if we\nshould prove unable, in this War, to impose our own terms on Germany.\nThen the peace that follows will be a long struggle, and in that\nstruggle we shall prevail. In the last long peace we were not\nsuspicious; we felt friendly enough to the Germans, and we gave them\nevery advantage. They despised us for our friendliness and used the\npeace to prepare our downfall. That will never happen again. If we\ncannot tame the cunning animal that has assaulted humanity, at least we\ncan and will tether him. Laws will not be necessary; there are millions\nof others besides the seamen of England who will have no dealings with\nan unsubdued and unrepentant Germany. What the Germans are not taught by\nthe War they will have to learn in the more tedious and no less costly\nschool of peace.",
        "In any case, whether we win through to real peace and real security, or\nwhether we are thrown back on an armed peace and the duty of unbroken\nvigilance, we shall be dependent for our future on the children who are\nnow learning in the schools or playing in the streets. It is a good\ndependence. The children of to-day are better than the children whom I\nknew when I was a child. I think they have more intelligence and\nsympathy; they certainly have more public spirit. We cannot do too much\nfor them. The most that we can do is nothing to what they are going to\ndo for us, for their own nation and people. I am not concerned to\ndiscuss the education problem. Formal education, carried on chiefly by\nmeans of books, is a very small part of the making of a man or a woman.\nBut I am interested to know what the children are thinking. You cannot\nfathom a child’s thoughts, but we know who are their best teachers, and\nwhat lessons have been stamped indelibly on their minds. Their teachers,\nwhom they never saw, and whose lessons they will never forget, lie in\ngraves in Flanders and France and Gallipoli and Syria and Mesopotamia,\nor unburied at the bottom of the sea. The runner falls, but the torch is\ncarried forward. This is what Julian Grenfell, who gave his mind and his\nlife to the War, has said in his splendid poem called Into Battle:",
        "     And life is colour and warmth and light,\n     And a striving evermore for these;\n     And he is dead who will not fight,\n     And who dies fighting hath increase.",
        "Those who died fighting will have such increase that a whole new\ngeneration, better even than the old, will be ready, no long time hence,\nto uphold and extend and decorate the Commonwealth of nations which\ntheir fathers and brothers saved from ruin.",
        "One thing I have never heard discussed, but it is the clearest gain of\nall, and already it may be called a certain gain. After the War the\nEnglish language will have such a position as it has never had before.\nIt will be established in world-wide security. Even before the War, it\nmay be truly said, our language was in no danger from the competition of\nthe German language. The Germans have never had much success in the\nattempt to get their language adopted by other peoples. Not all the\nmilitary laws of Prussia can drive out French from the hearts and homes\nof the people of Alsace. In the ports of the near and far East you will\nhear English spoken–pidgin English, as it is called, that is to say, a\nselection of English words suited for the business of daily life. But\nyou may roam the world over, and you will hear no pidgin German. Before\nthe War many Germans learned English, while very few English-speaking\npeople learned German. In other matters we disagreed, but we both knew\nwhich way the wind was blowing. It may be said, and said truly, that our\nwell-known laziness was one cause of our failing or neglecting to learn\nGerman. But it was not the only cause; and we are not lazy in tasks\nwhich we believe to be worth our while. Rather we had an instinctive\nbelief that the future does not belong to the German tongue. That belief\nis not likely to be impaired by the War. Armed ruffians can do some\nthings, but one thing they cannot do; they cannot endear their language\nto those who have suffered from their violence. The Germans poisoned the\nwells in South-West Africa; in Europe they did all they could to poison\nthe wells of mutual trust and mutual understanding among civilized men.\nDo they think that these things will make a good advertisement for the\nexplosive guttural sounds and the huddled deformed syntax of the speech\nin which they express their arrogance and their hate? Which of the\nchief European languages will come first, after the War, with the little\nnations? Will Serbia be content to speak German? Will Norway and Denmark\nfeel a new affection for the speech of the men who have degraded the old\nhumanity of the seas? Neighbourhood, kinship, and the necessities of\ncommerce may retain for the German language a certain measure of custom\nin Sweden and Switzerland, and in Holland. But for the most part Germans\nwill have to be content to be addressed in their own tongue only by\nthose who fear them, or by those who hope to cheat them.",
        "This gain, which I make bold to predict for the English language, is a\nreal gain, apart from all patriotic bias. The English language is\nincomparably richer, more fluid, and more vital than the German\nlanguage. Where the German has but one way of saying a thing, we have\ntwo or three, each with its distinctions and its subtleties of usage.\nOur capital wealth is greater, and so are our powers of borrowing.\nEnglish sprang from the old Teutonic stock, and we can still coin new\nwords, such as ’food-hoard’ and ’joy-ride’, in the German fashion. But\nlong centuries ago we added thousands of Romance words, words which came\ninto English through the French or Norman-French, and brought with them\nthe ideas of Latin civilization and of mediaeval Christianity. Later on,\nwhen the renewed study of Latin and Greek quickened the intellectual\nlife of Europe, we imported thousands of Greek and Latin words direct\nfrom the ancient world, learned words, many of them, suitable for\nphilosophers, or for writers who pride themselves on shooting a little\nabove the vulgar apprehension. Yet many of these, too, have found their\nway into daily speech, so that we can say most things in three ways,\naccording as we draw on one or another of the three main sources of our\nspeech. Thus, you can Begin, or Commence, or Initiate an undertaking,\nwith Boldness, or Courage, or Resolution. If you are a Workman, or\nLabourer, or Operative, you can Ask, or Bequest, or Solicit your\nemployer to Yield, or Grant, or Concede, an increase in the Earnings, or\nWages, or Remuneration which fall to the lot of your Fellow, or\nCompanion, or Associate. Your employer is perhaps Old, or Veteran, or\nSuperannuated, which may Hinder, or Delay, or Retard the success of your\napplication. But if you Foretell, or Prophesy, or Predict that the War\nwill have an End, or Close, or Termination that shall not only be\nSpeedy, or Rapid, or Accelerated, but also Great, or Grand, or\nMagnificent, you may perhaps Stir, or Move, or Actuate him to have Ruth,\nor Pity, or Compassion on your Mate, or Colleague, or Collaborator. The\nEnglish language, then, is a language of great wealth–much greater\nwealth than can be illustrated by any brief example. But wealth is\nnothing unless you can use it. The real strength of English lies in the\ninspired freedom and variety of its syntax. There is no grammar of the\nEnglish speech which is not comic in its stiffness and inadequacy. An\nEnglish grammar does not explain all that we can do with our speech; it\nmerely explains what shackles and restraints we must put upon our speech\nif we would bring it within the comprehension of a school-bred\ngrammarian. But the speech itself is like the sea, and soon breaks down\nthe dykes built by the inland engineer. It was the fashion, in the\neighteenth century, to speak of the divine Shakespeare. The reach and\ncatholicity of his imagination was what earned him that extravagant\npraise; but his syntax has no less title to be called divine. It is not\ncast or wrought, like metal; it leaps like fire, and moves like air. So\nis every one that is born of the spirit. Our speech is our great\ncharter. Far better than in the long constitutional process whereby we\nsubjected our kings to law, and gave dignity and strength to our\nCommons, the meaning of English freedom is to be seen in the illimitable\nfreedom of our English speech.",
        "Our literature is almost as rich as our language. Modern German\nliterature begins in the eighteenth century. Modern English literature\nbegan with Chaucer, in the fourteenth century, and has been full of\ngreat names and great books ever since. Nothing has been done in German\nliterature for which we have not a counterpart, done as well or\nbetter–except the work of Heine, and Heine was a Jew. His opinion of\nthe Prussians was that they are a compost of beer, deceit, and sand.\nFrench literature and English literature can be compared, throughout\ntheir long course, sometimes to the great advantage of the French.\nGerman literature cannot seriously be compared with either.",
        "It may be objected that literature and art are ornamental affairs, which\ncount for little in the deadly strife of nations. But that is not so.\nOur language cannot go anywhere without taking our ideas and our creed\nwith it, not to mention our institutions and our games. If the Germans\ncould understand what Chaucer means when he says of his Knight that",
        "                     he lovèd chivalry,\n     Truth and honoùr, freedom and courtesy,",
        "then indeed we might be near to an understanding. I asked a good German\nscholar the other day what is the German word for ’fair play’. He\nreplied, as they do in Parliament, that he must ask for notice of that\nquestion. I fear there is no German word for ’fair play’.",
        "The little countries, the pawns and victims of German policy, understand\nour ideas better. The peoples who have suffered from tyranny and\noppression look to England for help, and it is a generous weakness in us\nthat we sometimes deceive them by our sympathy, for our power is\nlimited, and we cannot help them all. But it will not count against us\nat the final reckoning that in most places where humanity has suffered\ncruelty and indignity the name of England has been invoked: not always\nin vain.",
        "And now, for I have kept to the last what I believe to be the greatest\ngain of all, the entry of America into the War assures the triumph of\nour common language. America is peopled by many races; only a minority\nof the inhabitants–an influential and governing minority–are of the\nEnglish stock. But here, again, the language carries it; and the ideas\nthat inspire America are ideas which had their origin in the long\nEnglish struggle for freedom. Our sufferings in this War are great, but\nthey are not so great that we cannot recognize virtue in a new recruit\nto the cause. No nation, in the whole course of human history, has ever\nmade a more splendid decision, or performed a more magnanimous act, than\nAmerica, when she decided to enter this War. She had nothing to gain,\nfor, to say the bare truth, she had little to lose. If Germany were to\ndominate the world, America, no doubt, would be ruined; but in all human\nlikelihood, Germany’s impious attempt would have spent itself and been\nbroken long before it reached the coasts of America. America might have\nstood out of the War in the assurance that her own interests were safe,\nand that, when the tempest had passed, the centre of civilization would\nbe transferred from a broken and exhausted Europe to a peaceful and\nprosperous America. Some few Americans talked in this strain, and\nfavoured a decision in this sense. But it was not for nothing that\nAmerica was founded upon religion. When she saw humanity in anguish, she\ndid not pass by on the other side. Her entry into the War has put an\nend, I hope for ever, to the family quarrel, not very profound or\nsignificant, which for a century and a half has been a jarring note in\nthe relations of mother and daughter. And it has put an end to another\ndanger. It seemed at one time not unlikely that the English language as\nit is spoken overseas would set up a life of its own, and become\nseparated from the language of the old country. A development of this\nkind would be natural enough. The Boers of South Africa speak Dutch, but\nnot the Dutch spoken in Holland. The French Canadians speak French, but\nnot the French of Molière. Half a century ago, when America was\nexploring and settling her own country, in wild and lone places, her\npioneers enriched the English speech with all kinds of new and vivid\nphrases. The tendency was then for America to go her own way, and to\ncultivate what is new in language at the expense of what is old. She\nprided herself even on having a spelling of her own, and seemed almost\nwilling to break loose from tradition and to coin a new American\nEnglish.",
        "This has not happened; and now, I think, it will not happen. For one\nthing, the American colonists left us when already we had a great\nliterature. Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Spenser belong to America no less\nthan to us, and America has never forgotten them. The education which\nhas been fostered in American schools and colleges keeps the whole\nnation in touch with the past. Some of their best authors write in a\nstyle that Milton and Burke would understand and approve. There is no\nmore beautiful English prose than Nathaniel Hawthorne’s. The best\nspeeches of Abraham Lincoln, and, we may truly add, of President Wilson,\nare merely classic English. During my own lifetime I am sure I have seen\nthe speech usages of the two peoples draw closer together. For one\nthing, we on this side now borrow, and borrow very freely, the more\npicturesque colloquialisms of America. On informal occasions I sometimes\nbrighten my own speech with phrases which I think I owe to one of the\nbest of living American authors, Mr. George Ade, of Chicago, the author\nof Fables in Slang. The press, the telegraph, the telephone, and the\ngrowing habit of travel bind us closer together every year; and the\nEnglish that we speak, however rich and various it may be, is going to\nremain one and the same English, our common inheritance.",
        "One question, the most important and difficult of all, remains to be\nasked. Will this War, in its course and in its effects, tend to prevent\nor discourage later wars? If the gains that it brings prove to be merely\npartial and national gains, if it exalts one nation by unjustly\ndepressing another, and conquers cruelty by equal cruelty, then nothing\ncan be more certain than that the peace of the world is farther off than\never. When she was near her death, Edith Cavell, patriot and martyr,\nsaid that patriotism is not enough. Every one who thinks on\ninternational affairs knows this; almost every one forgets it in time of\nwar. What can be done to prevent nations from appealing to the wild\njustice of revenge?",
        "A League of Nations may do good, but I am surprised that any one who has\nimagination and a knowledge of the facts should entertain high hopes of\nit as a full solution. There is a League of Nations to-day which has\ngiven a verdict against the Central Powers, and that verdict is being\nenforced by the most terrible War in all human history. If the verdict\nhad been given before the War began, it may be said, then Germany might\nhave accepted it, and refrained. So she might, but what then? She would\nhave felt herself wronged; she would have deferred the War, and, in ways\nthat she knows so well, would have set about making a party for herself\namong the nations of the League. Who can be confident that she would\nhave failed either to divide her judges, or to accumulate such elements\nof strength that she might dare to defy them? A League of Nations would\nwork well only if its verdicts were loyally accepted by all the nations\ncomposing it. To make majority-rule possible you must have a community\nmade up of members who are reasonably well informed upon one another’s\naffairs, and who are bound together by a tie of loyalty stronger and\nmore enduring than their causes of difference. It would be a happy thing\nif the nations of the world made such a community; and the sufferings of\nthis War have brought them nearer to desiring it. But those who believe\nthat such a community can be formed to-day or to-morrow are too\nsanguine. It must not be forgotten that the very principle of the\nLeague, if its judgements are to take effect, involves a world-war in\ncases where a strong minority resists those judgements. Every war would\nbecome a world-war. Perhaps this very fact would prevent wars, but it\ncannot be said that experience favours such a conclusion.",
        "There is no escape for us by way of the Gospels. The Gospel precept to\nturn the other cheek to the aggressor was not addressed to a meeting of\ntrustees. Christianity has never shirked war, or even much disliked it.\nWhere the whole soul is set on things unseen, wounds and death become of\nless account. And if the Christians have not helped us to avoid war, how\nshould the pacifists be of use? Those of them whom I happen to know, or\nto have met, have shown themselves, in the relations of civil life, to\nbe irritable, self-willed, combative creatures, where the average\nsoldier is calm, unselfish, and placable. There is something incongruous\nand absurd in the pacifist of British descent. He has fighting in his\nblood, and when his creed, or his nervous sensibility to physical\nhorrors, denies him the use of fighting, his blood turns sour. He can\nargue, and object, and criticize, but he cannot lead. All that he can\noffer us in effect is eternal quarrels in place of occasional fights.",
        "No one can do anything to prevent war who does not recognize its\nsplendour, for it is by its splendour that it keeps its hold on\nhumanity, and persists. The wickedest and most selfish war in the world\nis not fought by wicked and selfish soldiers. The spirit of man is\nimmense, and for an old memory, a pledged word, a sense of fellowship,\noffers this frail and complicated tissue of flesh and blood, which a pin\nor a grain of sand will disorder, to be the victim of all the atrocities\nthat the wit of man can compound out of fire and steel and poison. If\nthat spirit is to be changed, or directed into new courses, it must be\nby one who understands it, and approaches it reverently, with bared\nhead.",
        "The best hope seems to me to lie in paying chief attention to the\nimprovement of war rather than to its abolition; to the decencies of the\ncraft; to the style rather than the matter. Style is often more\nimportant than matter, and this War would not have been so fierce or so\nprolonged if it had not become largely a war on a point of style, a war,\nthat is to say, to determine the question how war should be waged. If\nthe Germans had behaved humanely and considerately to the civil\npopulation of Belgium, if they had kept their solemn promise not to use\npoison-gas, if they had refrained from murder at sea, if their valour\nhad been accompanied by chivalry, the War might now have been ended,\nperhaps not in their disfavour, for it would not have been felt, as it\nnow is felt, that they must be defeated at no matter how great a cost,\nor civilization will perish.",
        "Even as things are, there have been some gains in the manner of\nconducting war, which, when future generations look back on them, will\nbe seen to be considerable. It is true that modern science has devised\nnew and appalling weapons. The invention of a new weapon in war always\narouses protest, but it does not usually, in the long run, make war more\ninhuman. There was a great outcry in Europe when the broadsword was\nsuperseded by the rapier, and a tall man of his hands could be spitted\nlike a cat or a rabbit by any dexterous little fellow with a trained\nwrist. There was a wave of indignation, which was a hundred years in\npassing, when musketry first came into use, and a man-at-arms of great\nprowess could be killed from behind a wall by one who would not have\ndared to meet him in open combat. But these changes did not, in effect,\nmake war crueller or more deadly. They gave more play to intelligence,\nand abolished the tyranny of the bully, who took the wall of every man\nhe met, and made himself a public nuisance. The introduction of\npoison-gas, which is a small thing compared with the invention of\nfire-arms, has given the chemist a place in the ranks of fighting-men.\nAnd if science has lent its aid to the destruction of life, it has spent\ngreater zeal and more prolonged effort on the saving of life. No\nprevious war will compare with this in care for the wounded and maimed.\nIn all countries, and on all fronts, an army of skilled workers devote\nthemselves to this single end. I believe that this quickening of the\nhuman conscience, for that is what it is, will prove to be the greatest\ngain of the War, and the greatest advance made in restraint of war. If\nthe nations come to recognize that their first duty, and their first\nresponsibility, is to those who give so much in their service, that\nrecognition will of itself do more than can be done by any conclave of\nstatesmen to discourage war. It was the monk Telemachus, according to\nthe old story, who stopped the gladiatorial games at Rome, and was\nstoned by the people. If war, in process of time, shall be abolished,\nor, failing that, shall be governed by the codes of humanity and\nchivalry, like a decent tournament; then the one sacrificial figure\nwhich will everywhere be honoured for the change will be the figure not\nof a priest or a politician, but of a hospital nurse.",
        "A paper read to the Essay Society, Eton College, March 14, 1918.\nWhen you asked me to read or speak to you, I promised to speak about the\nWar. What I have to say is wholly orthodox, but it is none the worse for\nthat. Indeed, when I think how entirely the War possesses our thoughts\nand how entirely we are agreed concerning it, I seem to see a new\nmeaning in the creeds of the religions. These creeds grew up by general\nconsent, and no one who believed them grudged repeating them. In the\nface of an indifferent or hostile world the faithful found themselves\nobliged to define their belief, and to strengthen themselves by an\nunwearying and united profession of faith. It is the enemy who gives\nmeaning to a religious creed: without our creed we cannot win. So I am\nwilling to remind you of what you know, rather than to try to introduce\nyou to novelties.",
        "The strength of the enemy lies in his creed; not in the lands that he\nhas ravished from his neighbours. If his creed does not prevail, his\nlands will not help him. Germany has taken lands from Belgium, Serbia,\nRoumania, Russia, and the rest, but unless her digestion is as strong as\nher appetite, she will fail to keep them. If she is to hold them in\npeace, the peoples who inhabit these lands must be either exterminated\nor converted to the German creed. Lands can be annexed by a successful\ncampaign; they can be permanently conquered only by the operations of\npeace. The people who survive will be a weakness to the German Empire\nunless they accept what they are offered, a share in the German creed.",
        "That creed has not many natural attractions for the peoples on whom it\nis imposed by force. It is an intensely patriotic creed; it insists on\nracial supremacy, and on unity to be achieved by violence. Pleading and\npersuasion have little part in it except as instruments of deceit. There\nis no use in listening to what the Germans say; they do not believe it\nthemselves. What they say is for others; what they do is for themselves.\nWhile they are at war, language for them has only two uses–to conceal\ntheir thoughts, and to deceive their enemies.",
        "The creed of Western civilization, for which they feel nothing but\ncontempt, and on which they will be broken, is not a simple thing, like\ntheirs. The words by which it is commonly expressed–democracy,\nparliamentarism, individual liberty, diversity, free development–are\npuzzling theoretic words, which make no instinctive appeal to the heart.\nNevertheless, we stand for growth as against order; and for life as\nagainst death. If Germany wins this war, her system will have to be\nbroken or to decay before growth can start again. Must we lose even a\nhundred years in shaking ourselves free from the paralysis of the German\nnightmare?",
        "The Germans have shown themselves strong in their unity, and strong in\ntheir willingness to make great sacrifices to preserve that unity. No\none can deny nobility to the sacrifice made by the simple-minded German\nsoldier who dies fighting bravely for his people and his creed. His\nnarrowness is his strength, and makes unselfishness easier by saving his\nmind from question. ’This one thing you shall do’, his country says to\nhim, ’fight and die for your country, so that your country and your\npeople shall have lordship over other countries and other peoples. You\nare nothing; Germany is everything.’",
        "We who live in this island love our country with at least as deep a\npassion; but a creed so simple as the German creed will never do for us.\nWe are patriotic, but our patriotism is often overlaid and confused by a\nwider thought and a wider sympathy than the Germans have ever known.\nMuch extravagant praise has lately been given to the German power of\nthinking, which produces the elaborate marvels of German organization.\nBut this thinking is slave-thinking, not master-thinking; it spends\nitself wholly on devising complicated means to achieve a very simple\nend. That is what makes the Germans so like the animals. Their wisdom is\nall cunning. I have had German friends, two or three, in the course of\nmy life, but none of them ever understood a word that I said if I tried\nto say what I thought. You could talk to them about food, and they\nresponded easily. It was all very restful and pleasant, like talking to\nan intelligent dog.",
        "If each of the allied nations were devoted to the creed of nationalism,\nthe alliance could not endure. We depend for our strength on what we\nhold in common. The weakness of this wider creed is that it makes no\nsuch immediate and strong appeal to the natural instincts as is made by\nthe mother-country. It demands the habitual exercise of reason and\nimagination. Further, seeing that we are infinitely less tame and less\ndocile than the Germans, we depend for our strength on informing and\nconvincing our people, and on obtaining agreement among them. Questions\nwhich in Germany are discussed only in the gloomy Berlin head-quarters\nof the General Staff are discussed here in the newspapers. In the press,\neven under the censorship, we think aloud. It records our differences\nand debates our policy. You could not suppress these differences and\nthese debates without damaging our cause. There is no freedom worth\nhaving which does not, sooner or later, include the freedom to say what\nyou think.",
        "No doubt we could, if necessary, carry on for a time without the press;\nand I agree with those newspaper writers who have been saying recently\nthat the importance of the press is monstrously exaggerated by some of\nits critics. The working-man, so far as I know him, does not depend for\nhis patriotism on the leader-writers of the newspapers. He takes even\nthe news with a very large grain of salt. ’So the papers say’, he\nremarks; ’it may be true or it may not.’ Yet the press has done good\nservice, and might do better, in putting the meaning of the War before\nour people and in holding them together. Freedom means that we must love\nour diversity well enough to be willing to unite to protect it. We must\ndie for our differences as cheerfully as the Germans die for their\npattern. Or, if we can sketch a design of our cause, we must be as\npassionate in defence of that large vague design as the Germans are\npassionate in defence of their tight uniformity and their drill. If we\nwere to fail to keep together, our cause, I believe, would still\nprevail, but at a cost that we dare not contemplate, by way of anarchy,\nand the dissolution of societies, by long tortures, and tears, and\nmartyrdoms. If we refuse to die in the ranks against the German tyranny\nwe can keep our faith by dying at the stake. There are those who think\nmartyrdom the better way; and certainly that was how Christianity\nprevailed in Europe; you can read the story in Caxton’s translation of\nthe Golden Legend. But these saints and martyrs were making a\nbeginning; we are fighting to keep what we have won, and it would be a\nhuge failure on our part if we could keep nothing of it, but had to\nbegin all over again.",
        "The business of the press, then, at this present crisis, is to keep the\ncause for which we are fighting clearly before us, and this it has done\nwell; also, because we do not fight best in blinders, to tell us all\nthat can be known of the facts of the situation, and this it has done\nnot so well.",
        "The power of the newspapers is that most people read them, and that many\npeople read nothing else. Their weakness is that they have to sell or\ncease to be, so that by a natural instinct of self-preservation they\nfall back on the two sure methods whereby you can always capture the\nattention of the public. Any man who is trying to say what he thinks,\nmaking full allowance for all doubts and differences, runs the risk of\nlosing his audience. He can regain their attention by flattering them or\nby frightening them. Flattery and fright, the one following the other\nfrom day to day, and often from paragraph to paragraph, is a very large\npart of the newspaper reader’s diet. If he is a sane and busy man, he is\nnot too much impressed by either. He is not mercurial enough for the\nquick changes of an orator’s or journalist’s fancy, whereby he is called\non, one day, to dig the German warships like rats out of their harbour,\nand, not many days later, to spend his last shilling on the purchase of\nthe last bullet to shoot at the German invader. He knows that this is\nsuch stuff as dreams are made of. He knows also that the orator or\njournalist, after calling on him for these achievements, goes home to\ndinner. No great harm is done, just as no great harm is done by bad\nnovels. But an opportunity is lost; the press and the platform might do\nmore than they do to strengthen us and inform us, and help forward our\ncause.",
        "I name the press and the platform together because they are essentially\nthe same thing. Journalism is a kind of talk. The press, it is fair to\nsay, is ourselves; and every people, it may truly be said, has the press\nthat it deserves. But reading is a thing that we do chiefly for\nindulgence and pleasure in our idle time; and the press falls in with\nour mood, and supplies us with what we want in our weaker and lazier\nmoments. No responsible man, with an eager and active mind, spends much\nof his time on the newspapers. Those who are excited to action by what\nthey read in the papers are mostly content with the mild exercise of\nwriting to these same papers to explain that some one else ought to do\nsomething and to do it at once. Their excitement worries themselves more\nthan it hurts others. When the devil, with horns and hooves, appeared to\nCuvier, the naturalist, and threatened to devour him, Cuvier, who was\nasleep at the time, opened his eyes and looked at the terrible\napparition. ’Hm,’ he said, ’cloven-footed; graminivorous; needn’t be\nafraid of you;’ and he went to sleep again. A man who says that he has\nnot time to read the morning papers carefully is commonly a man who\ncounts; he knows what he has to do, and he goes on doing it. So far as I\nhave observed, the cadets who are training for command in the army take\nvery little interest in the exhortations of the newspapers. They even\nprefer the miserable trickle which is all that is left of football news.",
        "One of the chief problems connected with the press is therefore\nthis–how can it be prevented from producing hysteria in the\nfeeble-minded? In time of war the censorship no doubt does something to\nprevent this; and I think it might do more. ’Scare-lines’, as they are\ncalled–that is, sensational headings in large capital letters–might be\nreduced by law to modest dimensions. More important, the censorship\nmight insist that all who write shall sign their names to their\narticles. Why should journalists alone be relieved of responsibility to\ntheir country? Is it possible that the Government is afraid of the\npress? There is no need for fear. ’Beware of Aristophanes’, says Landor,\n’he can cast your name as a byword to a thousand cities of Asia for a\nthousand years. But all that the press can do by its disfavour is to\nkeep your name obscure in a hundred cities of England for a hundred\ndays. Signed articles are robbed of their vague impressiveness, and are\nknown for what they are–the opinions of one man. I would also recommend\nthat a photograph of the author be placed at the head of every article.\nI have been saved from many bad novels by the helpful pictorial\nadvertisements of modern publishers.",
        "The real work of the Press, as I said, is to help to hold the people\ntogether. Nothing else that it can do is of any importance compared with\nthis. We are at one in this War as we have never been at one before\nwithin living memory, as we were not at one against Napoleon or against\nLouis XIV. Our trial is on us; and if we cannot preserve our oneness, we\nfail. What would be left to us I do not know; but I am sure that an\nEngland which had accepted conditions of peace at Germany’s hands would\nnot be the England that any of us know. There might still be a few\nEnglishmen, but they would have to look about for somewhere to live.\nSerbia would be a good place; it has made no peace-treaty with Germany.",
        "We are profoundly at one; and are divided only by illusions, which the\npress, in times past, has done much to keep alive. One of these\nillusions is the illusion of party. I have never been behind the scenes,\namong the creaking machinery, but my impression, as a spectator, is that\nparties in England are made very much as you pick up sides for a game. I\nhave observed that they are all conservative. The affections are\nconservative; every one has a liking for his old habits and his old\nassociates. There is something comic in a well-nourished rich man who\nbelieves that he is a bold reformer and a destructive thinker. For real\nclotted reactionary sentiment I know nothing to match the table-talk of\nany aged parliamentary Radical. When we get a Labour Government, it will\nbe patriotic, prejudiced, opposed to all innovation, superstitiously\nreverential of the past, sticky and, probably, tyrannical.",
        "The party illusion has been much weakened by the War, and those who\nstill repeat the old catch-words are very near to lunacy. There is a\ndeeper and more dangerous illusion which has not been killed–the class\nillusion. We are all very much alike; but we live in water-tight\ncompartments called classes, and the inhabitants of each compartment\ntend to believe that they alone are patriotic. This illusion, to be\njust, is not fostered chiefly by the press, which wants to sell its work\nto all classes; but it has strong hold of the Government office. The\nGovernment does not know the people, except as an actor knows the\naudience; and therefore does not trust the people. It is pathetic to\nhear officials talking timidly of the people–will they endure hardships\nand sacrifices, will they carry through? Yet most of the successes we\nhave won in the War have to be credited not so much to the skill of the\nmanagement as to the amazing high courage of the ordinary soldier and\nsailor. Even soldiers are often subject to class illusion. I remember\nlistening, in the first month of the War, to a retired colonel, who\nexplained, with some heat, that the territorials could never be of any\nuse. That illusion has gone. Then it was Kitchener’s army–well-meaning\npeople, no doubt, but impossible for a European war. Kitchener’s army\nmade good. Now it is the civil population, who, though they are the\nblood relatives of the soldiers, are distrusted, and believed to be\nlikely to fail under a strain. Yet all the time, if you want to hear\nhalf-hearted, timid, pusillanimous talk, the place where you are most\nlikely to hear it is in the public offices. Most of those who talk in\nthis way would be brave enough in fight, but they are kept at desks, and\nworried with detailed business, and harassed by speculative dangers, and\nthey lose perspective. Soon or late, we are going to win this War; and\nit is the people who are going to win it.",
        "If the press (or perhaps the Government, which controls the press) is\nnot afraid of the people, why does it tell them so little about our\nreverses, and the merits of our enemies? For information concerning\nthese things we have to depend wholly on conversation with returned\nsoldiers. For instance, the horrible stories that we hear of the brutal\ntreatment of our prisoners are numerous, and are true, and make a heavy\nbill against Germany, which bill we mean to present. But are they fair\nexamples of the average treatment? We cannot tell; the accounts\npublished are almost exclusively confined to the worst happenings. Most\nof the officers with whom I have talked who had been in several German\nmilitary prisons said that they had nothing serious to complain of.\nPrison is not a good place, and it is not pleasant to have your\npea-soup and your coffee, one after the other, in the same tin dipper;\nbut they were soldiers, and they agreed that it would be absurd to make\na grievance of things like that. One private soldier was an even greater\nphilosopher. ’No’, he said, ’I have nothing to complain of. Of course,\nthey do spit at you a good deal.’ That man was unconquerable.",
        "In shipping returns and the like we are given averages; why are we told\nnothing at all of the milder experiences of our soldier prisoners? It\nwould not make us less resolved to do all that we can to better the lot\nof those who are suffering insult and torture, and to exact full\nretribution from the enemy. And it would bring some hope to those whose\nhusbands or children or friends are in German military prisons, and who\nare racked every day by tales of what, in fact, are exceptional\natrocities.",
        "Or take the question of the conduct of German officers. We know that the\nPrussian military Government, in its approved handbooks, teaches its\nofficers the use of brutality and terror as military weapons. The German\nphilosophy of war, of which this is a part, is not really a philosophy\nof war; it is a philosophy of victory. For a long time now the Germans\nhave been accustomed to victory, and have studied the arts of breaking\nthe spirit and torturing the mind of the peoples whom they invade. Their\nphilosophy of war will have to be rewritten when the time comes for them\nto accommodate their doctrine to their own defeat. In the meantime they\nteach frightfulness to their officers, and most of their officers prove\nready pupils. There must be some, one would think, here and there, if\nonly a sprinkling, who fall short of the Prussian doctrine, and are\nbetrayed by human feeling into what we should recognize as decent and\nhonourable conduct. And so there are; only we do not hear of them\nthrough the press. I should like to tell two stories which come to me\nfrom personal sources. The first may be called the story of the\nChristmas truce and the German captain. In the lull which fell on the\nfighting at the time of the first Christmas of the War, a British\nofficer was disquieted to notice that his men were fraternizing with the\nGermans, who were standing about with them in No-man’s land, laughing\nand talking. He went out to them at once, to bring them back to their\nown trenches. When he came up to his men, he met a German captain who\nhad arrived on the same errand. The two officers, British and German,\nfell into talk, and while they were standing together, in not unfriendly\nfashion, one of the men took a snapshot photograph of them, copies of\nwhich were afterwards circulated in the trenches. Then the men were\nrecalled to their duty, on the one side and the other, and, after an\ninterval of some days, the war began again. A little time after this the\nBritish officer was in charge of a patrol, and, having lost his way,\nfound himself in the German trenches, where he and his men were\nsurrounded and captured. As they were being marched off along the\ntrenches, they met the German captain, who ordered the men to be taken\nto the rear, and then, addressing the officer without any sign of\nrecognition, said in a loud voice, ’You, follow me!’ He led him by\ncomplicated ways along a whole series of trenches and up a sap, at the\nend of which he stopped, saluted, and, pointing with his hand, said\n’Your trenches are there. Good day.’",
        "My second story, the story of the British lieutenant in No-man’s land,\nis briefer. I was with a friend of mine, a young officer back from the\nfront, wounded, and the conduct of German officers was being discussed.\nHe said, ’You can’t expect me to be very hard on German officers, for\none of them saved my life’. He then told how he and a companion crept\nout into No-man’s land to bring in some of our wounded who were lying\nthere. When they had reached the wounded, and were preparing to bring\nthem in, they were discovered by the Germans opposite, who at once\nwhipped up a machine-gun and turned it on them. Their lives were not\nworth half a minute’s purchase, when suddenly a German officer leapt up\non to the parapet, and, angrily waving back the machine-gunners, called\nout, in English, ’That’s all right. You may take them in.’",
        "These are no doubt exceptional cases; the rule is very different. But a\ngood many of such cases are known to soldiers, and I have seen none of\nthem in the press. Soldiers are silent by law, and journalists either do\nnot hear these things, or, believing that hate is a valuable asset,\nsuppress all mention of them. If England could ever be disgraced by a\nmishap, she would be disgraced by having given birth to those\nEnglishmen, few and wretched, who, when an enemy behaves generously,\nconceal or deny the fact. And consider the effect of this silence on the\nGermans. There are some German officers, as I said, who are better than\nthe German military handbooks, and better than their monstrous chiefs.\nWhich of them will pay the smallest attention to what our papers say\nwhen he finds that they collect only atrocities, and are blind to\nhumanity if they see it in an enemy? He will regard our press accounts\nof the German army as the work of malicious cripples; and our perfectly\ntrue narrative of the unspeakable brutality and filthiness of the German\narmy’s doings will lose credit with him.",
        "If I had my way, I would staff the newspaper offices, as far as\npossible, with wounded soldiers, and I would give some of the present\nstaff a holiday as stretcher-bearers. Then we should hear more of the\ntruth.",
        "Is it feared that we should have no heart for the War if once we are\nconvinced that among the Germans there are some human beings? Is it\nbelieved that our people can be heroic on one condition only, that they\nshall be asked to fight no one but orangoutangs? Our airmen fight as\nwell as any one, in this world or above it, has ever fought; and we owe\nthem a great debt of thanks for maintaining, and, by their example,\nactually teaching the Germans to maintain, a high standard of decency.",
        "This War has shown, what we might have gathered from our history, that\nwe fight best up hill. From our history also we may learn that it does\nnot relax our sinews to be told that our enemy has some good qualities.\nWe should like him better as an enemy if he had more. We know what we\nhave believed; and we are not going to fail in resolve or perseverance\nbecause we find that our task is difficult, and that we have not a\nmonopoly of all the virtues.",
        "Most of us will not live to see it, for our recovery from this disease\nwill be long and troublesome, but the War will do great things for us.\nIt will make a reality of the British Commonwealth, which until now has\nbeen only an aspiration and a dream. It will lay the sure foundation of\na League of Nations in the affection and understanding which it has\npromoted among all English-speaking peoples, and in the relations of\nmutual respect and mutual service which it has established between the\nEnglish-speaking peoples and the Latin races. Our united Rolls of Honour\nmake the most magnificent list of benefactors that the world has ever\nseen. In the end, the War may perhaps even save the soul of the main\ncriminal, awaken him from his bloody dream, and lead him back by degrees\nto the possibility of innocence and goodwill.",
        "Annual Shakespeare Lecture of the British Academy, delivered July 4,\n1918\nThere is nothing new and important to be said of Shakespeare. In recent\nyears antiquaries have made some additions to our knowledge of the facts\nof his life. These additions are all tantalizing and comparatively\ninsignificant. The history of the publication of his works has also\nbecome clearer and more intelligible, especially by the labours of Mr.\nPollard; but the whole question of quartos and folios remains thorny and\ndifficult, so that no one can reach any definite conclusion in this\nmatter without a liberal use of conjecture.",
        "I propose to return to the old catholic doctrine which has been\nilluminated by so many disciples of Shakespeare, and to speak of him as\nour great national poet. He embodies and exemplifies all the virtues,\nand most of the faults, of England. Any one who reads and understands\nhim understands England. This method of studying Shakespeare by reading\nhim has perhaps gone somewhat out of vogue in favour of more roundabout\nways of approach, but it is the best method for all that. Shakespeare\ntells us more about himself and his mind than we could learn even from\nthose who knew him in his habit as he lived, if they were all alive and\nall talking. To learn what he tells we have only to listen.",
        "I think there is no national poet, of any great nation whatsoever, who\nis so completely representative of his own people as Shakespeare is\nrepresentative of the English. There is certainly no other English poet\nwho comes near to Shakespeare in embodying our character and our\nfoibles. No one, in this connexion, would venture even to mention\nSpenser or Milton. Chaucer is English, but he lived at a time when\nEngland was not yet completely English, so that he is only\nhalf-conscious of his nation. Wordsworth is English, but he was a\nrecluse. Browning is English, but he lived apart or abroad, and was a\ntourist of genius. The most English of all our great men of letters,\nnext to Shakespeare, is certainly Dr. Johnson, but he was no great poet.\nShakespeare, it may be suspected, is too poetic to be a perfect\nEnglishman; but his works refute that suspicion. He is the Englishman\nendowed, by a fortunate chance, with matchless powers of expression. He\nis not silent or dull; but he understands silent men, and he enters into\nthe minds of dull men. Moreover, the Englishman seems duller than he is.\nIt is a point of pride with him not to be witty and not to give voice to\nhis feelings. The shepherd Corin, who was never in court, has the true\nphilosophy. ’He that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain\nof good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.’",
        "Shakespeare knew nothing of the British Empire. He was an islander, and\nhis patriotism was centred on",
        "     This precious stone set in the silver sea,\n     Which serves it in the office of a wall,\n     Or as a moat defensive to a house,\n     Against the envy of less happier lands.",
        "When he speaks of Britons and British he always means the Celtic\npeoples of the island. Once only he makes a slip. There is a passage in\nKing Lear (IV. vi. 249) where the followers of the King, who in the\ntext of the quarto versions are correctly called ’the British party’,\nappear in the folio version as ’the English party’. Perhaps the quartos\ncontain Shakespeare’s own correction of his own inadvertence; but those\nof us, and we are many, who have been blamed by northern patriots for\nthe misuse of the word English may claim Shakespeare as a brother in\nmisfortune.",
        "Our critics, at home and abroad, accuse us of arrogance. I doubt if we\ncan prove them wrong; but they do not always understand the nature of\nEnglish arrogance. It does not commonly take the form of self-assertion.\nShakespeare’s casual allusions to our national characteristics are\nalmost all of a kind; they are humorous and depreciatory. Here are some\nof them. Every holiday fool in England, we learn from Trinculo in The\nTempest, would give a piece of silver to see a strange fish, though no\none will give a doit to relieve a lame beggar. The English are\nquarrelsome, Master Slender testifies, at the game of bear-baiting. They\nare great drinkers, says Iago, ’most potent in potting; your Dane, your\nGerman, and your swag-bellied Hollander are nothing to your English’.\nThey are epicures, says Macbeth. They will eat like wolves and fight\nlike devils, says the Constable of France. An English nobleman,\naccording to the Lady of Belmont, can speak no language but his own. An\nEnglish tailor, according to the porter of Macbeth’s castle, will steal\ncloth where there is hardly any cloth to be stolen, out of a French\nhose. The devil, says the clown in All’s Well, has an English name; he\nis called the Black Prince.",
        "Nothing has been changed in this vein of humorous banter since\nShakespeare died. One of the best pieces of Shakespeare criticism ever\nwritten is contained in four words of the present Poet Laureate’s Ode\nfor the Tercentenary of Shakespeare, ’London’s laughter is thine’. The\nwit of our trenches in this war, especially perhaps among the Cockney\nand South country regiments, is pure Shakespeare. Falstaff would find\nhimself at home there, and would recognize a brother in Old Bill.",
        "The best known of Shakespeare’s allusions to England are no doubt those\nsplendid outbursts of patriotism which occur in King John, and\nRichard II, and Henry V. And of these the dying speech of John of\nGaunt, in Richard II, is the deepest in feeling. It is a lament upon\nthe decay of England, ’this dear, dear land’. Since we began to be a\nnation we have always lamented our decay. I am afraid that the Germans,\nwhose self-esteem takes another form, were deceived by this. To the\nright English temper all bragging is a thing of evil omen. That temper\nis well expressed, where perhaps you would least expect to find it, in\nthe speech of King Henry V to the French herald:",
        "                           To say the sooth,–\n  Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much\n  Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,–\n  My people are with sickness much enfeebled,\n  My numbers lessened, and those few I have\n  Almost no better than so many French;\n  Who, when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,\n  I thought upon one pair of English legs\n  Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,\n  That I do brag thus! This your air of France\n  Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.\n  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am:\n  My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk;\n  My army but a weak and sickly guard;\n  Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,\n  Though France himself and such another neighbour\n  Stand in our way. There’s for thy labour, Montjoy.\n  Go bid thy master well advise himself:\n  If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,\n  We shall your tawny ground with your red blood\n  Discolour; and so, Montjoy, fare you well.\n  The sum of all our answer is but this:\n  We would not seek a battle as we are;\n  Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it;\n  So tell your master.",
        "That speech might have been written for the war which we are waging\nto-day against a less honourable enemy. But, indeed, Shakespeare is full\nof prophecy. Here is his description of the volunteers who flocked to\nthe colours in the early days of the war:",
        "  Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries,\n  With ladies’ faces and fierce dragons’ spleens,\n  Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,\n  Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,\n  To make a hazard of new fortunes here.\n  In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits\n  Than now the English bottoms have waft o’er\n  Did never float upon the swelling tide.",
        "And here is his sermon on national unity, preached by the Bishop of\nCarlisle:",
        "  O, if you rear this house against this house,\n  It will the woefullest division prove\n  That ever fell upon this cursed earth.\n  Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,\n  Lest child, child’s children, cry against you ’Woe!’",
        "The Patriotism of the Women Is Described By the Bastard in king John:",
        "  Your own ladies and pale-visag’d maids\n  Like Amazons come tripping after drums:\n  Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,\n  Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts\n  To fierce and bloody inclination.",
        "Lastly, Queen Isabella’s blessing, spoken over King Henry V and his\nFrench bride, predicts an enduring friendship between England and\nFrance:",
        "  As man and wife, being two, are one in love,\n  So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,\n  That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,\n  Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,\n  Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,\n  To make divorce of their incorporate league;\n  That English may as French, French Englishmen,\n  Receive each other! God speak this Amen!",
        "One of the delights of a literature as rich and as old as ours is that\nat every step we take backwards we find ourselves again. We are\ndelivered from that foolish vein of thought, so dear to ignorant\nconceit, which degrades the past in order to exalt the present and the\nfuture. It is easy to feel ourselves superior to men who no longer\nbreathe and walk, and whom we do not trouble to understand. Here is the\nreal benefit of scholarship; it reduces men to kinship with their race.\nScience, pressing forward, and beating against the bars which guard the\nsecrets of the future, has no such sympathy in its gift.",
        "Anyhow, in Shakespeare’s time, England was already old England; which if\nshe could ever cease to be, she might be Jerusalem, or Paradise, but\nwould not be England at all. What Shakespeare and his fellows of the\nsixteenth century gave her was a new self-consciousness and a new\nself-confidence. They foraged in the past; they recognized themselves in\ntheir ancestors; they found feudal England, which had existed for many\nhundreds of years, a dumb thing; and when she did not know her own\nmeaning, they endowed her purposes with words. They gave her a new\ndelight in herself, a new sense of power and exhilaration, which has\nremained with her to this day, surviving all the airy philosophic\ntheories of humanity which thought to supersede the old solid national\ntemper. The English national temper is better fitted for traffic with\nthe world than any mere doctrine can ever be, for it is marked by an\nimmense tolerance. And this, too, Shakespeare has expressed. Falstaff is\nperhaps the most tolerant man who was ever made in God’s image. But it\nis rather late in the day to introduce Falstaff to an English audience.\nPerhaps you will let me modernize a brief scene from Shakespeare,\naltering nothing essential, to illustrate how completely his spirit is\nthe spirit of our troops in Flanders and France.",
        "A small British expeditionary force, bound on an international mission,\nfinds itself stranded in an unknown country. The force is composed of\nmen very various in rank and profession. Two of them, whom we may call\na non-commissioned officer and a private, go exploring by themselves,\nand take one of the natives of the place prisoner. This native is an\nugly low-born creature, of great physical strength and violent criminal\ntendencies, a liar, and ready at any time for theft, rape, and murder.\nHe is a child of Nature, a lover of music, slavish in his devotion to\npower and rank, and very easily imposed upon by authority. His captors\ndo not fear him, and, which is more, they do not dislike him. They found\nhim lying out in a kind of no-man’s land, drenched to the skin, so they\ndetermine to keep him as a souvenir, and to take him home with them.\nThey nickname him, in friendly fashion, the monster, and the mooncalf,\nas who should say Fritz, or the Boche. But their first care is to give\nhim a drink, and to make him swear allegiance upon the bottle. ’Where\nthe devil should he learn our language?’ says the non-commissioned\nofficer, when the monster speaks. ’I will give him some relief, if it be\nbut for that.’ The prisoner then offers to kiss the foot of his captor.\n’I shall laugh myself to death’, says the private, ’at this puppy-headed\nmonster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,\nbut that the poor monster’s in drink.’ When the private continues to\nrail at the monster, his officer calls him to order. ’Trinculo, keep a\ngood tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer, the next tree–––\nThe poor monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.’",
        "In this scene from The Tempest, everything is English except the\nnames. The incident has been repeated many times in the last four years.\n’This is Bill,’ one private said, introducing a German soldier to his\ncompany. ’He’s my prisoner. I wounded him, and I took him, and where I\ngo he goes. Come on, Bill, old man.’ The Germans have known many\nfailures since they began the War, but one failure is more tragic than\nall the rest. They love to be impressive, to produce a panic of\napprehension and a thrill of reverence in their enemy; and they have\ncompletely failed to impress the ordinary British private. He remains\nincurably humorous, and so little moved to passion that his daily\noffices of kindness are hardly interrupted.",
        "Shakespeare’s tolerance, which is no greater than the tolerance of the\ncommon English soldier, may be well seen in his treatment of his\nvillains. Is a liar, or a thief, merely a bad man? Shakespeare does not\nmuch encourage you to think so. Is a murderer a bad man? He would be an\nundiscerning critic who should accept that phrase as a true and adequate\ndescription of Macbeth. Shakespeare does not dislike liars, thieves, and\nmurderers as such, and he does not pretend to dislike them. He has his\nown dislikes. I once asked a friend of mine, long since dead, who\nrefused to condemn almost anything, whether there were any vices that he\ncould not find it in his heart to tolerate. He replied at once that\nthere were two–cruelty, and bilking; which, if the word is not\nacademic, I may paraphrase as cheating the helpless, swindling a child\nout of its pennies, or leaving a house by the back door in order to\navoid paying your cabman his lawful fare. These exclusions from mercy\nShakespeare would accept; and I think he would add a third. His worst\nvillains are all theorists, who cheat and murder by the book of\narithmetic. They are men of principle, and are ready to expound their\nprinciple and to defend it in argument. They follow it, without remorse\nor mitigation, wherever it leads them. It is Iago’s logic that makes him\nso terrible; his mind is as cold as a snake and as hard as a surgeon’s\nknife. The Italian Renaissance did produce some such men; the modern\nGerman imitation is a grosser and feebler thing, brutality trying to\nemulate the glitter and flourish of refined cruelty.",
        "With his wonderful quickness of intuition and his unsurpassed subtlety\nof expression Shakespeare drew the characters of the Englishmen that he\nsaw around him. Why is it that he has given us no full-length portrait,\ncarefully drawn, of a hypocrite? It can hardly have been for lack of\nmodels. Outside England, not only among our enemies, but among our\nfriends and allies, it is agreed that hypocrisy is our national vice,\nour ruling passion. There must be some meaning in so widely held an\nopinion; and, on our side, there are damaging admissions by many\nwitnesses. The portrait gallery of Charles Dickens is crowded with\nhypocrites. Some of them are greasy and servile, like Mr. Pumblechook or\nUriah Heep; others rise to poetic heights of daring, like Mr. Chadband\nor Mr. Squeers. But Shakespeare’s hypocrites enjoy themselves too much;\nthey are artists to the finger-tips. It may be said, no doubt, that\nShakespeare lived before organized religious dissent had developed a new\ntype of character among the weaker brethren. But the Low Church\nProtestant, whom Shakespeare certainly knew, is not very different from\nthe evangelical dissenter of later days; and he did not interest\nShakespeare.",
        "My own impression is that Shakespeare had a free and happy childhood,\nand grew up without much check from his elders. It is the child who sees\nhypocrites. These preposterous grown-up people, who, if they are\nwell-mannered, do not seem to enjoy their food, who are fussy about\nmeaningless employments, and never give way to natural impulses, must\nsurely assume this veil of decorum with intent to deceive. Charles\nDickens was hard driven in his childhood, and the impressions that were\nthen burnt into him governed all his seeing. The creative spirit in him\ntransformed his sufferings into delight; but he never outgrew them; and,\nwhen he died, the eyes of a child were closed upon a scene touched, it\nis true, here and there with rapturous pleasure, rich in oddity, and\ntrembling with pathos, but, in the main, as bleak and unsatisfying as\nthe wards of a workhouse. The intense emotions of his childhood made the\nusual fervours of adolescence a faint thing in the comparison, and if\nyou want to know how lovers think and feel you do not go to Dickens to\ntell you. You go to Shakespeare, who put his childhood behind him, so\nthat he almost forgot it, and ran forward to seize life with both hands.\nHe sometimes looked back on children, and saw them through the eyes of\ntheir elders. Dickens saw men and women as they appear to children.",
        "This comparison suggests a certain lack of sympathy or lack of\nunderstanding in those who are quick to see hypocrisy in others. In\nDickens lack of sympathy was a fair revenge; moreover, his hypocrites\namused him so much that he did not wish to understand them. What a loss\nit would have been to the world if he had explained them away! But it is\ndifficult, I think, to see a hypocrite in a man whose intimacy you have\ncultivated, whose mind you have entered into, as Shakespeare entered\ninto the mind of his creatures. Hypocrisy, in its ordinary forms, is a\nsuperficial thing–a skin disease, not a cancer. It is not easy, at\nbest, to bring the outward and inward relations of the soul into perfect\nharmony; a hypocrite is one who too readily consents to their\nseparation. The English, for I am ready now to return to my point, are a\npeople of a divided mind, slow to drive anything through on principle,\nvery ready to find reason in compromise. They are passionate, and they\nare idealists, but they are also a practical people, and they dare not\ngive the rein to a passion or an idea. They know that in this world an\nunmitigated principle simply will not work; that a clean cut will never\ntake you through the maze. So they restrain themselves, and listen, and\nseem patient. They are not so patient as they seem; they must be\nhypocrites! A cruder, simpler people like the Germans feel indignation,\nnot unmixed perhaps with envy, when they hear the quiet voice and see\nthe white lips of the thoroughbred Englishman who is angry. It is not\nmanly or honest, they think, to be angry without getting red in the\nface. They certainly feel pride in their own honesty when they give\nexplosive vent to their emotions. They have not learned the elements of\nself-distrust. The Englishman is seldom quite content to be himself;\noften his thoughts are troubled by something better. He suffers from the\ndivided mind; and earns the reputation of a hypocrite. But the simpler\nnature that indulges itself and believes in itself has an even heavier\npenalty to pay. If, in the name of honesty, you cease to distinguish\nbetween what you are and what you would wish to be, between how you act\nand how you would like to act, you are in some danger of reeling back\ninto the beast. It is true that man is an animal; and before long you\nfeel a glow of conscious virtue in proclaiming and illustrating that\ntruth. You scorn the hypocrisy of pretending to be better than you are,\nand that very scorn fixes you in what you are. ’He that is unjust, let\nhim be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still.’\nThat is the epitaph on German honesty. I have drifted away from\nShakespeare, who knew nothing of the sea of troubles that England would\none day take arms against, and who could not know that on that day she\nwould outgo his most splendid praise and more than vindicate his\nreverence and his affection. But Shakespeare is still so live a mind\nthat it is vain to try to expound him by selected texts, or to pin him\nto a mosaic of quotations from his book. Often, if you seek to know what\nhe thought on questions which must have exercised his imagination, you\ncan gather it only from a hint dropped by accident, and quite\nirrelevant. What were his views on literature, and on the literary\ncontroversies which have been agitated from his day to our own? He tells\nus very little. He must have heard discussions and arguments on metre,\non classical precedent, on the ancient and modern drama; but he makes no\nmention of these questions. He does not seem to have attached any\nprophetic importance to poetry. The poets who exalt their craft are of a\nmore slender build. Is it conceivable that he would have given his\nsupport to a literary academy,–a project which began to find advocates\nduring his lifetime? I think not. It is true that he is full of good\nsense, and that an academy exists to promulgate good sense. Moreover his\nown free experiments brought him nearer and nearer into conformity with\nclassical models. Othello and Macbeth are better constructed plays\nthan Hamlet. The only one of his plays which, whether by chance or by\ndesign, observes the so-called unities, of action and time and place, is\none of his latest plays–The Tempest. But he was an Englishman, and\nwould have been jealous of his freedom and independence. When the\ngrave-digger remarks that it is no great matter if Hamlet do not recover\nhis wits in England, because there the men are as mad as he, the satire\nhas a sympathetic ring in it. Shakespeare did not wish to see the mad\nEnglish altered. Nor are they likely to alter; our fears and our hopes\nare vain. We entered on the greatest of our wars with an army no bigger,\nso we are told, than the Bulgarian army. Since that time we have\nregimented and organized our people, not without success; and our\nsoothsayers are now directing our attention to the danger that after the\nwar we shall be kept in uniform and shall become tame creatures, losing\nour independence and our spirit of enterprise. There is nothing that\nsoothsayers will not predict when they are gravelled for lack of matter,\nbut this is the stupidest of all their efforts. The national character\nis not so flimsy a thing; it has gone through good and evil fortune for\nhundreds of years without turning a hair. You can make a soldier, and a\ngood soldier, of a humorist; but you cannot militarize him. He remains a\nfree thinker.",
        "New institutions do not flourish in England. The town is a comparatively\nmodern innovation; it has never, so to say, caught on. Most schemes of\ntown-planning are schemes for pretending that you live in the country.\nThis is one of the most persistent of our many hypocrisies. Wherever\nworking people inhabit a street of continuous red-brick cottages, the\nnames that they give to their homes are one long catalogue of romantic\nlies. The houses have no gardens, and the only prospect that they\ncommand is the view of over the way. But read their names–The Dingle,\nThe Elms, Pine Grove, Windermere, The Nook, The Nest. Even social\npretence, which is said to be one of our weaknesses, and which may be\nread in such names as Belvoir or Apsley House, is less in evidence than\nthe Englishman’s passion for the country. He cannot bear to think that\nhe lives in a town. He does not much respect the institutions of a town.\nA policeman, before he has been long in the force, has to face the fact\nthat he is generally regarded as a comic character. The police are\nEnglishmen and good fellows, and they accept a situation which would\nrouse any continental gendarme to heroic indignation. Mayors, Aldermen,\nand Justices of the Peace are comic, and take it not quite so well.\nBeadles were so wholly dedicated to the purposes of comedy that I\nsuppose they found their position unendurable and went to earth; at any\nrate it is very difficult to catch one in his official costume.",
        "All this is reflected in Shakespeare. He knew the country, and he knew\nthe town; and he has not left it in doubt which was the cherished home\nof his imagination. He preferred the fields to the streets, but the\nArcadia of his choice is not agricultural or even pastoral; it is rather\na desert island, or the uninhabited stretches of wild and woodland\ncountry. Indeed, he has both described it and named it. ’Where will the\nold Duke live?’ says Oliver in As You Like It. ’They say he is already\nin the forest of Arden,’ says Charles the wrestler, ’and a many merry\nmen with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England.\nThey say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\ncarelessly, as they did in the golden world.’ That is Shakespeare’s\nArcadia; and who that has read As You Like It will deny that it\nbreathes the air of Paradise?",
        "It is quite plain that the freedom that Shakespeare valued was in fact\nfreedom, not any of those ingenious mechanisms to which that name has\nbeen applied by political theorists. He thought long and profoundly on\nthe problems of society; and anarchy has no place among his political\nideals. It is by all means to be avoided–at a cost. But what harm would\nanarchy do if it meant no more than freedom for all the impulses of the\nenlightened imagination and the tender heart? The ideals of his heart\nwere not political; and when he indulges himself, as he did in his\nlatest plays, you must look for him in the wilds; whether on the road\nnear the shepherd’s cottage, or in the cave among the mountains of\nWales, or on the seashore in the Bermudas. The laws that are imposed\nupon the intricate relations of men in society were a weariness to him;\nand in this he is thoroughly English. The Englishman has always been an\nobjector, and he has a right to object, though it may very well be held\nthat he is too fond of larding his objection with the plea of\nconscience. But even this has a meaning in our annals; as a mere\nquestion of right we are very slow to prefer the claim of the organized\nopinions of society to the claim of the individual conscience. We know\nthat there is no good in a man who is doing what he does not will to do.\nWe are not like our poets or our men of action to be void of\ninspiration. A gift is nothing if there is no benevolence in the giver:",
        "                    For to the noble mind\n  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.",
        "We ask for the impulse as well as the deed. Even when he is speaking of\nsocial obligations Shakespeare makes his strongest appeal not to force\nor command, but to the natural piety of the heart:",
        "  If ever you have looked on better days,\n  If ever been where bells have knolled to church,\n  If ever sat at any good man’s feast,\n  If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,\n  And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,\n  Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:\n  In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.",
        "So speaks Orlando when the Duke has met his threats with fair words;\nand he adds an apology:",
        "                 Pardon me, I pray you;\n  I thought that all things had been savage here,\n  And therefore put I on the countenance\n  Of stern commandment.",
        "The ultimate law between man and man, according to Shakespeare, is the\nlaw of pity. I suppose that most of us have had our ears so dulled by\nearly familiarity with Portia’s famous speech, which we probably knew by\nheart long before we were fit to understand it, that the heavenly\nquality of it, equal to almost anything in the New Testament, is\nobscured and lost. There is no remedy but to read it again; to remember\nthat it was conceived in passion; and to notice how the meaning is\nraised and perfected as line follows line:",
        "  portia.  Then Must the Jew Be Merciful.",
        " Shylock. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.",
        "  Portia. The quality of mercy is not strained.\n  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\n  Upon the place beneath; it is twice bless’d;\n  It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:\n  ’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\n  The throned monarch better than his crown.\n  His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\n  The attribute to awe and majesty,\n  Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\n  But mercy is above this sceptred sway,\n  It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\n  It is an attribute to God himself,\n  And earthly power doth then show likest God’s\n  When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\n  Though justice be thy plea, consider this,\n  That in the course of justice none of us\n  Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy,\n  And that same prayer doth teach us all to render\n  The deeds of mercy.",
        "That speech rises above the strife of nations; it belongs to humanity.\nBut an Englishman wrote it; and the author, we may be sure, if he ever\nmet with the doctrine that a man who is called on to help his own people\nis in duty bound to set aside the claims of humanity, and to stop his\nears to the call of mercy, knew that the doctrine is an invention of the\ndevil, stupid and angry, as the devil commonly is. There are hundreds of\nthousands of Englishmen who, though they could not have written the\nspeech, yet know all that it teaches, and act on the knowledge. It is\npart of the creed of the Navy. We can speak more confidently than we\ncould have spoken three or four years ago. We know that not the\nextremest pressure of circumstance could ever bring the people of\nEngland to forget all the natural pieties, to permit official duties to\nannul private charities, and to join in the frenzied dance of hate and\nlust which leads to the mouth of the pit.",
        "Yet Germany, where all this seems to have happened, was not very long\nago a country where it was easy to find humanity, and simplicity, and\nkindness. It was a country of quiet industry and content, the home of\nfairy stories, which Shakespeare himself would have loved. The Germans\nof our day have made a religion of war and terror, and have used\ncommerce as a means for the treacherous destruction of the independence\nand freedom of others. They were not always like that. In the fifteenth\ncentury they spread the art of printing through Europe, for the service\nof man, by the method of peaceful penetration. My friend Mr. John\nSampson recently expressed to me a hope that our air-forces would not\nbomb Mainz, ’for Mainz’, he said, ’is a sacred place to the\nbibliographer’. According to a statement published in Cologne in 1499,\n’the highly valuable art of printing was invented first of all in\nGermany at Mainz on the Rhine. And it is a great honour to the German\nnation that such ingenious men are to be found among them....And in the\nyear of our Lord 1450 it was a golden year, and they began to print, and\nthe first book they printed was the Bible in Latin: it was printed in a\nlarge character, resembling the types with which the present mass-books\nare printed.’ Gutenberg, the printer of this Bible, never mentions his\nown name, and the only personal note we have of his, in the colophon of\nthe Catholicon, printed in 1460, is a hymn in praise of his city:\n’With the aid of the Most High, who unlooses the tongues of infants and\noft-times reveals to babes that which is hidden from learned men, this\nadmirable book, the Catholicon, was finished in the year of the\nincarnation of our Saviour MCCCCLX, in the foster town of Mainz, a town\nof the famous German nation, which God in his clemency, by granting to\nit this high illumination of the mind, has preferred before the other\nnations of the world.’",
        "There is something not quite unlike modern Germany in that; and yet\nthese older activities of the Germans make a strange contrast with their\nwork to-day. It was in the city of Cologne that Caxton first made\nacquaintance with his craft. Everywhere the Germans spread printing like\na new religion, adapting it to existing conditions. In Bavaria they used\nthe skill of the wood-engravers, and at Augsburg, Ulm, and Nuremberg\nproduced the first illustrated printed books. It was two Germans of the\nold school, Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz, who carried the art to\nItaly, casting the first type in Roman characters, and printing editions\nof the classics, first in the Benedictine monastery of St. Scholastica\nat Subiaco, and later at Rome. They also cast the first Greek type. It\nwas three Germans, Gering, Kranz, and Freyburger, who first printed at\nParis, in 1470. It was a German who set up the first printing-press in\nSpain, in 1474. The Germans were once the cherishers, as now they are\nthe destroyers, of the inheritance of civilization. I do not pretend to\nexplain the change. Perhaps it is a tragedy of education. That is a\ndangerous moment in the life of a child when he begins to be uneasily\naware that he is valued for his simplicity and innocence. Then he\nresolves to break with the past, to put away childish things, to forgo\naffection, and to earn respect by imitating the activities of his\nelders. The strange power of words and the virtues of abstract thought\nbegin to fascinate him. He loses touch with the things of sense, and\nceases to speak as a child. If his first attempts at argument and dogma\nwin him praise and esteem, if he proves himself a better fighter than an\nolder boy next door, who has often bullied him, and if at the same time\nhe comes into money, he is on the road to ruin. His very simplicity is a\nsnare to him. ’What a fool I was’, he thinks, ’to let myself be put\nupon; I now see that I am a great philosopher and a splendid soldier,\nborn to subdue others rather than to agree with them, and entitled to a\nchief share in all the luxuries of the world. It is for me to say what\nis good and true, and if any of these people contradict me I shall knock\nthem down.’ He suits his behaviour to his new conception of himself, and\nis soon hated by all the neighbours. Then he turns bitter. These people,\nhe thinks, are all in a plot against him. They must be blind to goodness\nand beauty, or why do they dislike him! His rage reaches the point of\nmadness; he stabs and poisons the villagers, and burns down their\nhouses. We are still waiting to see what will become of him.",
        "This outbreak has been long preparing. Seventy years before the War the\nGerman poet Freiligrath wrote a poem to prove that Germany is Hamlet,\nurged by the spirit of her fathers to claim her inheritance, vacillating\nand lost in thought, but destined, before the Fifth Act ends, to strew\nthe stage with the corpses of her enemies. Only a German could have hit\non the idea that Germany is Hamlet. The English, for whom the play was\nwritten, know that Hamlet is Hamlet, and that Shakespeare was thinking\nof a young man, not of the pomposities of national ambition. But if\nthese clumsy allegories must be imposed upon great poets, Germany need\nnot go abroad to seek the likeness of her destiny. Germany is Faust; she\ndesired science and power and pleasure, and to get them on a short lease\nshe paid the price of her soul.",
        "For the present, at any rate, the best thing the Germans can do with\nShakespeare is to leave him alone. They have divorced themselves from\ntheir own great poets, to follow vulgar half-witted political prophets.\nAs for Shakespeare, they have studied him assiduously, with the complete\napparatus of criticism, for a hundred years, and they do not understand\nthe plainest words of all his teaching.",
        "In England he has always been understood; and it is only fair, to him\nand to ourselves, to add that he has never been regarded first and\nforemost as a national poet. His humanity is too calm and broad to\nsuffer the prejudices and exclusions of international enmities. The\nsovereignty that he holds has been allowed to him by men of all parties.\nThe schools of literature have, from the very first, united in his\npraise. Ben Jonson, who knew him and loved him, was a classical scholar,\nand disapproved of some of his romantic escapades, yet no one will ever\noutgo Ben Jonson’s praise of Shakespeare.",
        "  Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,\n  To whom all Scenes of Europe homage owe.\n  He was not-of an ago, but for all time!",
        "The sects of religion forget their disputes and recognize the spirit of\nreligion in this profane author. He cannot be identified with any\ninstitution. According to the old saying, he gave up the Church and took\nto religion. Ho gave up the State, and took to humanity. The formularies\nand breviaries to which political and religious philosophers profess\ntheir allegiance were nothing to him. These formularies are a convenient\nshorthand, to save the trouble of thinking. But Shakespeare always\nthought. Every question that he treats is brought out of the realm of\nabstraction, and exhibited in its relation to daily life and the minds\nand hearts of men. He could never have been satisfied with such a smug\nphrase as ’the greatest happiness of the greatest number’. His mind\nwould have been eager for details. In what do the greatest number find\ntheir happiness? How far is the happiness of one consistent with the\nhappiness of another? What difficulties and miscarriages attend the\nbusiness of transmuting the recognized materials for happiness into\nliving human joy? Even these questions he would not have been content to\nhandle in high philosophic fashion; he would have insisted on instances,\nand would have subscribed to no code that is not carefully built out of\ncase-law. He knew that sanity is in the life of the senses; and that if\nthere are some philosophers who are not mad it is because they live a\ndouble life, and have consolations and resources of which their books\ntell you nothing. It is the part of their life which they do not think\nit worth their while to mention that would have interested Shakespeare.\nHe loves to reduce things to their elements. ’Is man no more than this?’\nsays the old king on the heath, as he gazes on the naked madman.\n’Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the\nsheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here’s three of us are\nsophisticated! Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more\nbut such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you\nlendings!’ That is how Shakespeare lays the mind of man bare, and strips\nhim of his pretences, to try if he be indeed noble. And he finds that\nman, naked and weak, hunted by misfortune, liable to all the sins and\nall the evils that follow frailty, still has faith left to him, and\ncharity. King Lear is still every inch a king.",
        "That is not a little discovery, for when his mind came to grips with\nhuman life Shakespeare did not deal in rhetoric; so that the good he\nfinds is real good–’’tis in grain; ’twill endure wind and weather’.\nNothing is easier than to make a party of humanity, and to exalt mankind\nby ignorantly vilifying the rest of the animal creation, which is full\nof strange virtues and abilities. Shakespeare refused that way; he saw\nman weak and wretched, not able to maintain himself except as a\npensioner on the bounty of the world, curiously ignorant of his nature\nand his destiny, yet endowed with certain gifts in which he can find\nsustenance and rest, brave by instinct, so that courage is not so much\nhis virtue as cowardice is his lamentable and exceptional fault, ready\nto forget his pains or to turn them into pleasures by the alchemy of his\nmind, quick to believe, and slow to suspect or distrust, generous and\ntender to others, in so far as his thought and imagination, which are\nthe weakest things about him, enable him to bridge the spaces that\nseparate man from man, willing to make of life a great thing while he\nhas it, and a little thing when he comes to lose it. These are some of\nhis gifts; and Shakespeare would not have denied the saying of a thinker\nwith whom he has no very strong or natural affinity, that ’the greatest\nof these is charity’.",
