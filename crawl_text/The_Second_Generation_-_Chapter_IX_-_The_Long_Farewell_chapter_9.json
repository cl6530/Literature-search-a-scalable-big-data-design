        "Not until Adelaide told Arthur and saw the expression that succeeded his\nfirst blank stare of incredulity did she realize what the world, her\n“world,” would think of her engagement to Theodore Hargrave. It was\nilluminative of her real character and of her real mind as to Ross, and\nas to Dory also, that, instead of being crushed by her brother’s look of\ndownright horror, she straightway ejected the snobbish suggestions with\nwhich her vanity had been taunting her, and called her heart, as well as\nher pride, to the defense of Dory.",
        "“You’re joking,” said Arthur, when he was able to articulate; “and a\nmighty poor joke it is. Dory! Why, Del, it’s ridiculous. And in place of\nRoss Whitney!”",
        "“Be careful what you say, Artie,” she warned in a quiet, ominous tone,\nwith that in her eyes which should in prudence have halted him. “I am\nengaged to Dory, remember.”",
        "“Nonsense!” cried Arthur. “Why, he hasn’t a cent, except his beggarly\nsalary as professor at that little jay college. And even if he should\namount to something some day, he’ll never have anything or any standing\nin society. I thought you had pride, Del. Just wait till I see him! I’ll\nlet him know what I think of his impudence. Of course, I don’t blame him.\nNaturally, he wants to get up in the world. But you–” Arthur’s laugh\nwas a sneer–\"And I thought you were proud!”",
        "From Del’s eyes blazed that fury which we reserve for those we love when\nthey exasperate us. “Shame on you, Arthur Ranger!” she exclaimed. “Shame\non you! See what a snob you have become. Except that he’s poor, Dory\nHargrave has the advantage of any man we know. He’s got more in his head\nany minute than you or your kind in your whole lives. And he is honorable\nand a gentleman–a real gentleman, not a pretender. You aren’t big\nenough to understand him; but, at least, you know that if it weren’t for\nyour prospects from father, you wouldn’t be in the same class with him.\nHe is somebody in himself. But you–and–and your kind–what do youamount to, in yourselves?”",
        "Arthur lowered at her. “So this is what you’ve been leading up to,\nwith all the queer talk you’ve been giving me on and off, ever since\nwe came home.”",
        "That remark seemed to Adelaide for an instant to throw a flood of light\nin amazing revelation upon her own innermost self. “I believe it is!” she\nexclaimed, as if dazed. Then the light seemed to go, seemed to have been\nonly imaginary. It is not until we are much older than Del then was, that\nwe learn how our acts often reveal us to ourselves.",
        "“So you’re in love with Dory,” scoffed Arthur. “You’re a wonder–you are!\nTo go about the world and get education and manners and culture, and then\nto come back to Saint X and take up with a jay–a fellow that’s never\nbeen anywhere.”",
        "“Physically, he hasn’t traveled much,” said Del, her temper curiously\nand suddenly restored. “But mentally, Artie, dear, he’s been distances\nand to places and in society that your poor brain would ache just at\nhearing about.”",
        "“You’ve lost your senses!”",
        "“No, dear,” replied Del sweetly; “on the contrary, I’ve put myself in the\nway of finding them.”",
        "“You needn’t ’bluff’ with me,” he retorted. He eyed her suspiciously.\n“There’s some mystery in this.”",
        "Del showed that the chance shot had landed; but, instantly recovering\nherself, she said: “It may interest you to know that a while ago, when\nI told you I was engaged to him, I felt a little uneasy. You see, I’ve\nhad a long course at the same school that has made such a gentleman of\nyou. But, as the result of your talk and the thoughts it suggested, I\nhaven’t a doubt left. I’d marry Dory Hargrave now, if everybody in the\nworld opposed me. Yes, the more opposition, the prouder I’ll be to be\nhis wife!”",
        "“What’s the matter, children?” came in their mother’s voice. “What are\nyou quarreling about?” Mrs. Ranger was hurrying through the room on her\nway to the kitchen; she was too used to heated discussions between them\nto be disturbed.",
        "“What do you think of this, mother?” almost shouted Arthur. “Del here\nsays she’s engaged to Dory Hargrave!”",
        "Mrs. Ranger stopped short. “Gracious!” she ejaculated.",
        "She felt for her “specs,” drew them down from her hair, and hastily\nadjusted them for a good look, first at Arthur, then at Del. She looked\nlong at Del, who was proudly erect and was at her most beautiful best,\neyes glittering and cheeks aglow. “Have you and Ross had a falling out,\nDel?” she asked.",
        "“No, mother,” replied Adelaide; “but we–we’ve broken our engagement,\nand–What Artie says is true.”",
        "No one spoke for a full minute, though the air seemed to buzz with\nthe thinking and feeling. Then, Mrs. Ranger: “Your father mustn’t\nhear of this.”",
        "“Leave me alone with mother, Artie,” commanded Adelaide.",
        "Arthur went, pausing in the doorway to say: “I’m sorry to have hurt you,\nDel. But I meant every word, only not in anger or meanness. I know you\nwon’t do it when you’ve thought it over.”",
        "When Arthur had had time to get far enough away, Adelaide said: “Mother,\nI want you to hear the whole truth–or as much of it as I know myself.\nRoss came and broke off our engagement so that he could marry Theresa\nHowland. And I’ve engaged myself to Dory–partly to cover it, but not\naltogether, I hope. Not principally, I believe. I’m sick and ashamed of\nthe kind of things I’ve been so crazy about these last few years. Before\nthis happened, before Ross came, being with father and thinking over\neverything had made me see with different eyes. And I–I want to try to\nbe–what a woman ought to be.”",
        "Ellen Ranger slowly rolled her front hair under her fingers. At length\nshe said: “Well–I ain’t sorry you’ve broke off with Ross. I’ve been\nnoticing the Whitneys and their goings on for some time. I saw they’d got\nclean out of my class, and–I’m glad my daughter hasn’t. There’s a\ncommon streak in those Whitneys. I never did like Ross, though I never\nwould have said anything, as you seemed to want him, and your father had\nalways been set on it, and thought so high of him. He laid himself out to\nmake your pa think he was a fine character and full of business–and I\nain’t denying that he’s smart, mighty smart–too smart to suit me.” A\nlong reflective pause, then: “But–Dory–Well, my advice is to think it\nover before you jump clear in. Of course, you’ll have enough for both,\nbut I’d rather see you taking up with some man that’s got a good\nbusiness. Teachin’ ’s worse than preachin’ as a business. Still, there’s\nplenty of time to think about that. You’re only engaged.”",
        "“Teachin’ ’s worse than preachin’\"–Adelaide’s new, or, rather, revived\ndemocracy was an aspiration rather than an actuality, was–as to the part\nabove the soil, at least–a not very vigorous looking forced growth\nthrough sordid necessity. In this respect it was like many, perhaps most,\nhuman aspirations–and, like them, it was far more likely to wither than\nto flourish. “Teachin’ ’s worse than preachin’\"–Del began to slip\ndismally down from the height to which Arthur’s tactless outburst had\nblown her. Down, and down, and down, like a punctured balloon–gently,\nbut steadily, dishearteningly. She was ashamed of herself, as ashamed as\nany reader of these chronicles is for her–any reader with one standard\nfor judging other people and another for judging himself. To the credit\nof her character must be set down her shame at her snobbishness. The\nsnobbishness itself should not be set down to her discredit, but should\nbe charged up to that class feeling, as old as property, and fostered\nand developed by almost every familiar fact in our daily environment.",
        "“I shouldn’t be surprised but your father’d be glad, if he knew,” her\nmother was saying. “But it’s no use to risk telling him. A shock\nmight–might make him worse.” She started up. “I must go to him. I\ncame to send you, while I was looking after Mary and the dinner, and I\nclean forgot.”",
        "She hurried away. Adelaide sat thinking, more and more forlorn, though\nnot a whit less determined. “I ought to admire him more than I did Ross,\nand I ought to want to marry him–and I will!”",
        "The birds had stopped singing in the noonday heat. The breeze had died\ndown. Outdoors, in the house, there was not a sound. She felt as if she\nmust not, could not breathe. The silence, like a stealthy hand, lifted\nher from her chair, drew her tiptoeing and breathless toward the room in\nwhich her father was sitting. She paused at its threshold, looked. There\nwas Hiram, in his chair by the window, bolt upright, eyes open and\ngazing into the infinite. Beside that statue of the peace eternal knelt\nEllen, a worn, wan, shrunken figure, the hands clasped, the eyes closed,\nthe lips moving.",
        "“Mother! Mother!” cried Del.",
        "Her mother did not hear. She was moaning, “I believe, Lord, I believe!\nHelp Thou my unbelief!”",
