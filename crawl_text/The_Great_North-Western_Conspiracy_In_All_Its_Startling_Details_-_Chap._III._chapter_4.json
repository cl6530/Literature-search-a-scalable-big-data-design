        "ARENA OF THE REBELLION EXTENDED–SECRET ORGANIZATION–PLAN OF\nFORMATION–KNIGHTS OF GOLDEN CIRCLE–TRANSPORTS ON THE RIVERS\nBURNED–EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES–SUPREME COUNCIL IN NEW YORK–DEGREES OF THE\nORDERS.",
        "As above intimated, early in 1862 the Richmond Government foresaw the\nnecessity of bringing to its aid the hitherto comparatively dormant\nresources of treason in the Northern States, and the enlargement of the\narena of the Rebellion. Raids having ominously failed in their design to\narouse the lethargic spirits of Northern sympathizers and advocates, to\nrush to the standard of the misguided South, it was immediately determined\nto prolong the war, at least, to the date of the next Presidential\nelection, and then through the agencies of secret organization and\nequipment, seize upon the excitement of the people in a hotly contested\nelection, to force a rebellion against the administration elect in the\nNorth, as had been done in the South in 1860.",
        "The executive part of this object was at once given into the hands of such\ntrustworthy men, both North and South, as were deemed suitable to the\nenterprise, and the work of secret political organization was vigorously\nbegun in Northern Missouri and Kentucky, from thence it gradually spread,\nuntil it was firmly rooted in the political tenets of the minority party\nin the States of Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, New York, and portions of\nother adjoining States.",
        "Much dissimilarity existed in the operative structure and formation of the\nvarious organizations, from time to time thus instituted. To give the\npublic a full and complete description of these organizations, would be\nforeign to the writer’s time, space and purpose, but in order that some\nrecord of their character may be made, a general description of each in\nits order in point of time, with a reference to the features in which\nradical dissimilarities appear, would seem indispensible to the poor\nperfection sought to be obtained by the author of these sketches.",
        "Upon the discovery by Southern leaders that their cause must fail unless\n“fire in the rear” was at once instigated in the North, the Order of the\nKnights of the Golden Circle, an old Southern institution, was infused\nwith life, and began its pilgrimage Northward, one additional creed having\nbeen ingrafted upon it.",
        "It will be remembered that this Order was originally composed of the\nwealthiest planters, merchants and professional men of the South, and had\nfor its sole object the inculcation of treason against the United States.\nIt was simply an institution to educate the Southern mind to the required\nstandard of rebellion. But when the Order was introduced into the North,\nit was found feasible to give it a double capacity, first that of an\neducational capacity, and second that of an incendiary capacity, which\ncomprised the destruction of government property, and the houses and\nproperty of leading loyal citizens of the North, known to be strong\nadvocates of the suppression of the rebellion. But this organization in\nname and cardinal purpose was short-lived, its career having subserved but\na meagre benefit to the South, in a practical point of view. The damage it\ndid was principally confined to the burning of United States transports on\nthe Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and the moulding of the crude opinions of\nits members, which served as a solid foundation for the establishment of\nthe Order of American Knights, which immediately succeeded its\ndissolution.",
        "Like all institutions of iniquity, the sun of the Order of Knights of the\nGolden Circle went down in blood, but was the signal for the advent of an\nOrder better calculated to meet the ends of its design.",
        "It had been seen upon experiment that the Golden Circle had been\nsuccessful beyond the most sanguine expectations of its instigators, and\nas the necessity of Northern revolution to insure the certain success of\nthe Confederacy daily became more apparent to the rebels, both North and\nSouth, the Order of the American Knights was inaugurated–the executioner\nof that fell purpose. Its sun arose to its meridian with the suddenness of\na meteor, doomed to flash across the canopy and burst in scattering atoms.",
        "The Order of American Knights was erected upon the dissolved fragments of\nthe Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle, which Order, in name, was\nabandoned for the additional reason that the suspicions of the Government\nhad begun to be aroused as to the character of its movements. At the time\nof the extinction of the Golden Circle, its members were at once inducted\ninto the Order of American Knights, so that this Order obtained much\nprimary advantage, in point of numerical strength, over its predecessor,\nfor the Golden Circle had already insidiously crept into the very hearts\nof several Northern cities and states. The American Knights being composed\nin the outset wholly of men who from experience had discovered whatever\ndefectiveness may have been chargeable upon the Golden Circle, it was\nsought in the new Order to remedy the evils of the old Order.",
        "With this in view, looking over the former and later phases of the Golden\nCircle as it had existed in the North and South, respectively, it was\nagreed to give the new Order still another capacity, and what was called\nthe military branch or department was added, the incendiary capacity of\nthe old Order being merged into this new military department.",
        "We have seen that there had been in the North an Order mainly of\neducational capacity, contemplating revolution so soon as the public mind\ncould be put in readiness for such an event, but now for the first time we\nfind an Order prepared in its organic structure, to speedily collect\ntogether the elements of revolution and set them in motion. Such a concern\nwas the Order of American Knights. True, the rise of the Order created a\nmomentary excitement in political circles, as yet unaccustomed to dealing\nwith the stern problems of Northern revolution by resort to arms. But, by\nthe admirable adjustment of the administrative powers of the Order, into\ndegrees, sub-degrees and departments of degrees and sub-degrees, the\nleaders were enabled to give to each adventurer in quest of the hidden\nmysteries of the so-called impartial maxims of genuine Democracy–that\nDemocracy which boasts of having permeated through every fibre and artery\nof our political, commercial and social systems, a comfortable and genial\nsphere in which he was left to operate upon his good behavior.",
        "Upon this ingenious plan the vast body and mass of the Order simply held\nthe relation of probationary membership, until they were rendered\ncompetent through the educational capacity of the society, to advance into\nfull fellowship with its diabolical design. A glance at this organization\nwill suffice to show the shrewdness of the transient and local agents of\nthe Confederacy, in their formation of an Order, having for its mission\nthe attainment of so many incidental objects, without in the meantime\nsubjecting themselves to the dangers of collision in their machinery.\nAccordingly, the Order was composed of three general degrees, viz.: First,\nthe Temple Degree, second, the Grand Council Degree, and third, the\nSupreme Council Degree.",
        "The first or Temple Degree, resembled the county organization of a State,\nand held the same relation to the second or Grand Council Degree (which\nwas the state organization of the Order,) that our county government holds\nto our State government, and it was always sought to establish this first\nor Temple Degree at each county seat in a State, as expeditiously as\npossible, that the second or Grand Council Degree could the sooner be\nfully represented, and begin its State management of the Order. In other\nchapters the writer has made a passing, though sufficient allusion to the\ninternal workings of these Temples, and doubtless the initiated reader, in\ndifferent sections, will recognize the facts we have already and are\nfurther about to state, notwithstanding the “obligation” the author is\nsupposed to have subscribed to, not to reveal the existence of the Order\nand its secrets, under penalty of “suffering a shameful death.”",
        "The process usually followed in instituting the Temple Degree, was to send\nmissionaries with authority, into the districts proposed to be organized,\nwho called together such of the “unterrified” leaders as were known to be\n“sound on Jeff. Davis’ goose,” before whom the design and object of the\nOrder was confidentially laid for their approval or rejection, by a\nmajority vote. It is important to recollect that the record does not\nafford an instance where a majority of those assembled for this purpose,\nrejected the Order as inconsistent with their political views. On the\ncontrary, it was everywhere received by the politicians, both great and\nsmall, as “just the thing they had been looking for.” These politicians\nwere then left to “manage their own local affairs” concerning the Order,\n“subject only to the constitution” of Jeff. Davis. Generally, several\nmeetings and some discussion enabled these empyrics to determine plans of\nstrategy to screen themselves, by “covering the tracks in the sand,” a\nremark frequently heard from members.",
        "“All whom we arrested wore the same general wolfish aspect.\"–From the\ntestimony of Brig. Gen. B.J. Sweet.]",
        "The plan in most cases adopted, was to familiarize a sufficient number of\nthe elect, with a grossly immoral and treasonable pamphlet, called the\n“Ritual of the Order,” to enable them to officer the Temple, and “induct\"\nany number of “candidates” supposed to be “in waiting in the ante-room,\ninto the sublime,” but in fact dark and dubious “mysteries of the Order.”",
        "After one or more squads of these “candidates in” anxious and breathless\n“waiting” had been inducted, (meanwhile staring like stuck pigs at every\nobject and officer which met their eyes,) in addition to the regular\nofficers of the Temple already installed, it was considered that enough\nofficial and canvassing material had been acquired, and the more prominent\npoliticians, not officers of the Temple, deemed it prudent to absent\nthemselves from most of the weekly meetings. Again, it was an illusion of\nthese leaders, to put forward the most irresponsible persons at their\ncommand, as the mouth-pieces and official representatives of the Order, to\nthe end that if detected, the theory of crazy, powerless fools, could be\nwielded upon public sentiment by an undisturbed partisan press, to save\nthe scheme from thorough investigation and development by the authorities.",
        "In evidence of the fact of these illusions, L.A. Doolittle lectures the\nTemple in Chicago on the “purposes and plans of the Order,” (but who by\nthe way, was not so “insane on the subject” as the men who put him forward\nhave sought to show him to be,) and prominent politicians, not before\nknown to be members of the fraternity, appear prior to semi-annual\nelections as candidates for representatives in the Grand Council.",
        "It was duly announced, also, that an extra session of the Supreme Council\nhad been convened in the city of New York, charged with the special\nbusiness of revising the ritual, changing the signs, passwords, grips, and\ngiving to the Order a new name. Pursuant to announcement, Charles W.\nPatten made his appearance in the Temple with the rituals and\nparaphernalia of the new Order of the Sons of Liberty–the result of the\nproceedings of the late Supreme Council.",
        "This obscure individual, with fame limited to the dusty walls of the\nInvincible Club Rooms and the traitor’s dungeon at Camp Douglas, upon his\nappearance in the Temple, assigned two chief reasons for the recent action\nof the Supreme Council. First and most important was, the obvious\ninadequacy of the Order of American Knights to subserve the purpose for\nwhich it was instituted, in consequence of the subordination of the\nmilitary to the civil department. And, second, the disclosure in St. Louis\nhad rendered the Order liable to intrusion by spies, an embarrassment to\nbe avoided only by alteration of signs, grips, passwords, and name. We\nwere then informed that we were Sons of Liberty (a sensible man would have\nsaid sons of the devil, if he had dared to have spoken the truth), and\nearnestly exhorted to exercise the utmost caution in adhering to the new\nrules and instructions of the Supreme Council. It is not a little amusing\nto witness the homeopathic doses of modern democracy, carefully\nadministered to the rank and file of the northern people through the\nmedium of these Orders.",
        "In the first place, the Golden Circle edifies the “stranger advancing in\ndark, devious ways” with lessons upon the doctrine of state sovereignty,\nand admonishes him to “follow the straight and narrow path which is paved\nwith gems and pearls, and bordered with perennial flowers whose perfumes\nall his senses will entrance,” all of which is received by the sincere\ncandidate with every mark of approval. We next find the American Knights\nembracing its members in the bedazzling folds of military lace to be used\nwhen in arms against the Government. A splendid spectacle of the doctrines\nof Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Douglas! And to cap the miserable\nclimax, men boasting of the Democracy of their fathers in a line of lineal\ndescent for generations back, are required to subscribe to the doctrine of\nthe subordination of the civil to the military authority by the tenets of\nthe Sons of Liberty.",
        "This astonishing feature of the Sons of Liberty, as contradistinguished\nfrom the Orders which preceded it, at first met with murmurs of disfavor,\nbut the dissatisfaction was principally among men who ultimately acted the\nnobler part, and as the tide of treason rolled up to sustain this\nmeasure “for the good of the Order,” all such were submerged and lost\nsight of, except by the evil eye set upon them as spies.",
        "Without offering his advice, the writer would respectfully ask the true\nDemocrat, who may yet, from the temptations of firmly-rooted prejudices,\nincline to the belief that this organization was purely democratic in the\nAndrew Jackson acceptation of that term, how the above statement of\nprinciples comports with his notions of the doctrines of the party with\nwhich he has hitherto seen fit to fellowship?",
        "Is it not clearly to be seen that this Order meditated the establishment\nof a government more despotic in its character than history furnishes any\nexample of? A government with three degrees or departments, each\noath-bound and a profound secret to the other, moving in their appointed\nspheres, and the civil departments of which were secondary, in point of\npower, to the military departments!",
        "Let no man, of whatever political persuasion he may be, flatter himself\nfor a moment that such a government could be Republican in its nature.",
        "Having now traced, with perhaps a tedious hand, the rise and fall of two\npolitical Orders, ranking among the most powerful instruments of crime and\npublic wrong of their day, the writer bids their unmourned remains\nfarewell, to pass to the consideration in the succeeding chapter, of the\ndesperate career and final explosion of the Order of the Sons of\nLiberty–a solemn warning to the American people forever.",
        "To save the Goudys, Caulfields, Adams, Edwards, Duncans, Wickershams,\nCuttings, and Kimberlys, the Morrises, Walshes, Jacksons, Pattens, Gearys,\nand Doolittles were put forward because they were eager for the fray, and\npossessed the temerity to brave the danger of Union bullets.",
        "We have now seen how the Temple or First Degree was instituted in counties;\nhow the various elements of treason were collected together and detailed\nfor their special service of educating the ignorant, manufacturing\nmaterials and munitions of war, and devising plots to burn, plunder, and\npillage unsuspecting cities; how each member was singled out according to\nhis fitness for certain duties, which he performed without their character\ncoming even to his fellow members of the same degree; and how the brained\nleaders of these institutions retired to the back ground to elude the\nvigilance of the ministers of the law, and “adjust the wires” that were to\ncheck to-day, and to-morrow precipitate the conspiracy.",
        "The Grand Council, or Second Degree, was established in every State where\nthe Temple Degree had obtained any strength and character as to numbers.\nThis Degree resembled the State in its governmental organization, and bore\nthe same relation to the Supreme Council or Third Degree that the State\ngovernments of the Federal Union bear to the government at Washington. The\nOrder having a military department, these Grand Councils, in council\nassembled, adopted the militia and other statute laws of the particular\nState, with such revisions, exceptions and additional laws as were deemed\nessential to the successful operation of the Order.",
        "Regular semi-annual meetings of the Grand Councils were held, convening\nrespectively on the 22d of August and the 22d of February–the latter, in\nsacrilege be it said, being religiously observed as the birthday of\nWashington.",
        "But extra sessions were almost monthly called during the year of 1864,\nprior to the election, to take precautionary and other expedient action\nupon the continually recurring changes of that eventful year. No\nconsiderable battle was fought in the front, that was not the signal for\nthe assembling of this council, and no political event of any importance\ntranspired that did not receive the solemn deliberations of this already\nde facto legislative body. Of course no person ever became a member of\nthis Council who had not first been inducted into the Temple, and then by\nhis Temple elected as a representative in the Grand Council, the election\nfor which purpose was held semi-annually as above, and new representatives\ntook their seats at each regular session.",
        "The Grand Council embraced in its sphere of labors such duties as\nexperience seemed to dictate, as being necessary to the fulfilment of the\nmission of the Order. It provided remedies for unmistakable evils, and\nwatched with a zealous care and fostering hand, every interest of treason\nwithin the boundaries of its jurisdiction.",
        "The Supreme Council or Third and highest Degree of the Order in\norganization, was built after the pattern of the Federal government at\nWashington, and wielded a similar general control over the affairs of the\nOrder, that our National government exerts over the consequences growing\nout of the union of the States under one central government. Here we see\nhow admirably the design to effect Northern rebellion was conceived. The\nwhole machinery of a government de facto, and in disguise though, it\nwas, with all its branches, both civil and military in active operation\nfor months and years within the very sound of the echoing steps of\nsenators in the halls of the Capitol, was indeed a source of the most\nserious concern to the authorities, for the safety of the Republic. But\nvalorous daring, tempered with prudence, was destined to bring to the\nlight of day this infernal work of years, and accordingly the city of St.\nLouis was the scene of the first public development of the Order of\nAmerican Knights, early in the spring of 1864, the principal facts of\nwhich disclosure the public learned from the press at the time, hence the\nwriter will only allude in this connection to the effect created in\nvarious Circles of the Order, by the attempt upon the part of the\nGovernment to thwart the perpetration of the red-handed crimes\ncontemplated by the leaders. When it was officially announced by Reuben\nCassile, presiding Grand Seignior of the Chicago Temple, then recently\nremoved from the Invincible Club Hall to McCormick’s Building, that\ndisclosures of the Order in St. Louis had occurred, every countenance was\nstamped with dismay. The timely appearance at the Temple, however, of\nJudge Morris and other leaders, served to interpose restraint upon any\nserious apprehensions of difficulty resulting to the Order.",
