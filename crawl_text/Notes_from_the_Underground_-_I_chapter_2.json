        "\nI am a sick man. ...  I am a spiteful man.  I am an unattractive man.  I\nbelieve my liver is diseased.  However, I know nothing at all about my\ndisease, and do not know for certain what ails me.  I don’t consult a doctor\nfor it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. \nBesides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine,\nanyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am\nsuperstitious).  No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite.  That you\nprobably will not understand.  Well, I understand it, though.  Of course, I\ncan’t explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in this case by my\nspite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot “pay out” the doctors by not\nconsulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only\ninjuring myself and no one else.  But still, if I don’t consult a doctor it is\nfrom spite.  My liver is bad, well—let it get worse!",
        "I have been going on like that for a long time—twenty years.  Now I am\nforty.  I used to be in the government service, but am no longer.  I was a\nspiteful official.  I was rude and took pleasure in being so.  I did not take\nbribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at least.  (A\npoor jest, but I will not scratch it out.  I wrote it thinking it would sound\nvery witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off\nin a despicable way, I will not scratch it out on purpose!)",
        "When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I\nsat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I\nsucceeded in making anybody unhappy.  I almost did succeed.  For the\nmost part they were all timid people—of course, they were petitioners. \nBut of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not\nendure.  He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a\ndisgusting way.  I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over\nthat sword.  At last I got the better of him.  He left off clanking it.  That\nhappened in my youth, though.\nBut do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?\nWhy, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually,\neven in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly conscious with\nshame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an embittered man,\nthat I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it.  I\nmight foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to play with, give me a cup of\ntea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be appeased.  I might even be\ngenuinely touched, though probably I should grind my teeth at myself afterwards\nand lie awake at night with shame for months after.  That was my way.",
        "I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official.  I was\nlying from spite.  I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with\nthe officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful.  I was conscious\nevery moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely opposite to\nthat.  I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite elements.\nI knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving\nsome outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let them,\npurposely would not let them come out.  They tormented me till I was\nashamed: they drove me to convulsions and—sickened me, at last, how\nthey sickened me!  Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am\nexpressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness\nfor something?  I am sure you are fancying that ...  However, I assure you\nI do not care if you are. ...",
        "It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to\nbecome anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an honest\nman, neither a hero nor an insect.  Now, I am living out my life in my\ncorner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an\nintelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool\nwho becomes anything.  Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must and\nmorally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of\ncharacter, an active man is pre-eminently a limited creature.  That is my\nconviction of forty years.  I am forty years old now, and you know forty\nyears is a whole lifetime; you know it is extreme old age.  To live longer\nthan forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral.  Who does live\nbeyond forty?  Answer that, sincerely and honestly I will tell you who do:\nfools and worthless fellows.  I tell all old men that to their face, all these\nvenerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend seniors!  I tell the\nwhole world that to its face!  I have a right to say so, for I shall go on\nliving to sixty myself.  To seventy!  To eighty!  ...  Stay, let me \ntake breath ...",
        "You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you.  You are\nmistaken in that, too.  I am by no means such a mirthful person as you\nimagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble (and\nI feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I am—then my\nanswer is, I am a collegiate assessor.  I was in the service that I might have\nsomething to eat (and solely for that reason), and when last year a distant\nrelation left me six thousand roubles in his will I immediately retired\nfrom the service and settled down in my corner.  I used to live in this\ncorner before, but now I have settled down in it.  My room is a wretched,\nhorrid one in the outskirts of the town.  My servant is an old country-\nwoman, ill-natured from stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty\nsmell about her.  I am told that the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and\nthat with my small means it is very expensive to live in Petersburg.  I\nknow all that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and\nmonitors. ...  But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away\nfrom Petersburg!  I am not going away because ... ech!  Why, it is\nabsolutely no matter whether I am going away or not going away.",
        "But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?",
        "Answer: Of himself.",
        "Well, so I will talk about myself.",
