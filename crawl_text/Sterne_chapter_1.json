        "The materials for a biography of Sterne are by no means abundant.\nOf the earlier years of his life the only existing record is that\npreserved in the brief autobiographical memoir which, a few months\nbefore his death, he composed, in the usual quaint staccato style of\nhis familiar correspondence, for the benefit of his daughter. Of his\nchildhood; of his school-days; of his life at Cambridge, and in his\nYorkshire vicarage; of his whole history, in fact, up to the age of\nforty-six, we know nothing more than he has there jotted down. He\nattained that age in the year 1759; and at this date begins that\nseries of his Letters, from which, for those who have the patience\nto sort them out of the chronological confusion in which his daughter\nand editress involved them, there is, no doubt, a good deal to be\nlearnt. These letters, however, which extend down to 1768, the year\nof the writer’s death, contain pretty nearly all the contemporary\nmaterial that we have to depend on. Freely as Sterne mixed in the best\nliterary society, there is singularly little to be gathered about him,\neven in the way of chance allusion and anecdote, from the memoirs and\nana of his time. Of the many friends who would have been competent\nto write his biography while the facts were yet fresh, but one, John\nWilkes, ever entertained–if he did seriously entertain–the idea\nof performing this pious work; and he, in spite of the entreaties of\nSterne’s widow and daughter, then in straitened circumstances, left\nunredeemed his promise to do so. The brief memoir by Sir Walter Scott,\nwhich is prefixed to many popular editions of Tristram Shandy and\nthe Sentimental Journey, sets out the so-called autobiography in\nfull, but for the rest is mainly critical; Thackeray’s well-known\nlecture essay is almost wholly so; and nothing, worthy to be dignified\nby the name of a Life of Sterne, seems ever to have been published,\nuntil the appearance of Mr. Percy Fitzgerald’s two stout volumes,\nunder this title, some eighteen years ago. Of this work it is hardly\ntoo much to say that it contains (no doubt with the admixture of a\ngood deal of superfluous matter) nearly all the information as to the\nfacts of Sterne’s life that is now ever likely to be recovered. The\nevidence for certain of its statements of fact is not as thoroughly\nsifted as it might have been; and with some of its criticism I, at\nleast, am unable to agree. But no one interested in the subject of\nthis memoir can be insensible of his obligations to Mr. Fitzgerald\nfor the fruitful diligence with which he has laboured in a too long\nneglected field.",
