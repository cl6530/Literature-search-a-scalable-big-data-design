        "We turned-in early, knowing that we might expect an early call;\nand sure enough, before the stars had quite faded, “All hands ahoy!\"\nand we were turned-to, heaving out ballast.  A regulation of the port\nforbids any ballast to be thrown overboard; accordingly, our long-boat\nwas lined inside with rough boards and brought alongside the gangway,\nbut where one tub-full went into the boat, twenty went overboard.\nThis is done by every vessel, for the ballast can make but little\ndifference in the channel, and it saves more than a week of labor,\nwhich would be spent in loading the boats, rowing them to the point,\nand unloading them.  When any people from the Presidio were on\nboard, the boat was hauled up and ballast thrown in; but when the\ncoast was clear, she was dropped astern again, and the ballast\nfell overboard. This is one of those petty frauds which every\nvessel practises in ports of inferior foreign nations, and which\nare lost sight of, among the countless deeds of greater weight\nwhich are hardly less common.  Fortunately a sailor, not being a\nfree agent in work aboard ship, is not accountable; yet the fact\nof being constantly employed, without thought, in such things,\nbegets an indifference to the rights of others.",
        "Friday, and a part of Saturday, we were engaged in this work,\nuntil we had thrown out all but what we wanted under our cargo\non the passage home; when, as the next day was Sunday, and a\ngood day for smoking ship, we cleared everything out of the\ncabin and forecastle, made a slow fire of charcoal, birch bark,\nbrimstone, and other matters, on the ballast in the bottom of\nthe hold, calked up the hatches and every open seam, and pasted\nover the cracks of the windows, and the slides of the scuttles,\nand companionway.  Wherever smoke was seen coming out, we calked\nand pasted, and, so far as we could, made the ship smoke tight. \nThe captain and officers slept under the awning which was spread\nover the quarter-deck; and we stowed ourselves away under an old\nstudding-sail, which we drew over one side of the forecastle. \nThe next day, from fear that something might happen, orders were\ngiven for no one to leave the ship, and, as the decks were lumbered\nup with everything, we could not wash them down, so we had nothing\nto do, all day long. Unfortunately, our books were where we could not\nget at them, and we were turning about for something to do, when one\nman recollected a book he had left in the galley.  He went after\nit, and it proved to be Woodstock.  This was a great windfall,\nand as all could not read it at once, I, being the scholar of\nthe company, was appointed reader.  I got a knot of six or eight\nabout me, and no one could have had a more attentive audience. \nSome laughed at the “scholars,” and went over the other side\nof the forecastle, to work, and spin their yarns; but I carried\nthe day, and had the cream of the crew for my hearers.  Many of\nthe reflections, and the political parts, I omitted, but all the\nnarrative they were delighted with; especially the descriptions\nof the Puritans, and the sermons and harangues of the Round-head\nsoldiers.  The gallantry of Charles, Dr. Radcliffe’s plots,\nthe knavery of “trusty Tompkins,\"–in fact, every part seemed to\nchain their attention.  Many things which, while I was reading,\nI had a misgiving about, thinking them above their capacity, I was\nsurprised to find them enter into completely. ",
        "I read nearly all day, until sundown; when, as soon as supper was\nover, as I had nearly finished, they got a light from the galley;\nand by skipping what was less interesting, I carried them through\nto the marriage of Everard, and the restoration of Charles the\nSecond, before eight o’clock. ",
        "The next morning, we took the battens from the hatches, and opened\nthe ship.  A few stifled rats were found; and what bugs, cockroaches,\nfleas, and other vermin, there might have been on board, must have\nunrove their life-lines before the hatches were opened.  The ship\nbeing now ready, we covered the bottom of the hold over, fore and\naft, with dried brush for dunnage, and having levelled everything\naway, we were ready to take in our cargo.  All the hides that had\nbeen collected since the California left the coast, (a little more\nthan two years,) amounting to about forty thousand, were cured,\ndried, and stowed away in the house, waiting for our good ship\nto take them to Boston. ",
        "Now began the operation of taking in our cargo, which kept us hard\nat work, from the grey of the morning till star-light, for six weeks,\nwith the exception of Sundays, and of just time to swallow our meals.\nTo carry the work on quicker, a division of labor was made.  Two men\nthrew the hides down from the piles in the house, two more picked\nthem up and put them on a long horizontal pole, raised a few feet\nfrom the ground, where they were beaten, by two more, with flails,\nsomewhat like those used in threshing wheat.  When beaten, they were\ntaken from this pole by two more, and placed upon a platform\nof boards; and ten or a dozen men, with their trowsers rolled\nup, were constantly going, back and forth, from the platform to\nthe boat, which was kept off where she would just float, with the\nhides upon their heads.  The throwing the hides upon the pole was\nthe most difficult work, and required a sleight of hand which was\nonly to be got by long practice.  As I was known for a hide-curer,\nthis post was assigned to me, and I continued at it for six or\neight days, tossing, in that time, from eight to ten thousand hides,\nuntil my wrists became so lame that I gave in; and was transferred\nto the gang that was employed in filling the boats, where I remained\nfor the rest of the time.  As we were obliged to carry the hides\non our heads from fear of their getting wet, we each had a piece\nof sheepskin sewed into the inside of our hats, with the wool next\nto our heads, and thus were able to bear the weight, day after day,\nwhich would otherwise have soon worn off our hair, and borne hard upon\nour skulls.  Upon the whole, ours was the best berth; for though the\nwater was nipping cold, early in the morning and late at night,\nand being so continually wet was rather an exposure, yet we got\nrid of the constant dust and dirt from the beating of the hides,\nand being all of us young and hearty, did not mind the exposure.\nThe older men of the crew, whom it would have been dangerous to\nhave kept in the water, remained on board with the mate, to stow\nthe hides away, as fast as they were brought off by the boats.",
        "We continued at work in this manner until the lower hold was filled\nto within four feet of the beams, when all hands were called aboard\nto commence steeving.  As this is a peculiar operation, it will\nrequire a minute description. ",
        "Before stowing the hides, as I have said, the ballast is levelled\noff, just above the keelson, and then loose dunnage placed upon it,\non which the hides rest.  The greatest care is used in stowing, to make\nthe ship hold as many hides as possible.  It is no mean art, and a man\nskilled in it is an important character in California.  Many a dispute\nhave I heard raging high between professed “beach-combers,” as to\nwhether the hides should be stowed “shingling,” or “back-to-back,\nand flipper-to-flipper;” upon which point there was an entire and\nbitter division of sentiment among the savans.  We adopted each\nmethod at different periods of the stowing, and parties ran high\nin the forecastle, some siding with “old Bill” in favor of the\nformer, and others scouting him, and relying upon “English Bob\"\nof the Ayacucho, who had been eight years in California, and was\nwilling to risk his life and limb for the latter method.  At length\na compromise was effected, and a middle course, of shifting the ends\nand backs at every lay, was adopted, which worked well, and which,\nthough they held it inferior to their own, each party granted was\nbetter than that of the other. ",
        "Having filled the ship up, in this way, to within four feet of\nher beams, the process of steeving commenced, by which an hundred\nhides are got into a place where one could not be forced by hand,\nand which presses the hides to the utmost, sometimes starting the\nbeams of the ship, resembling in its effects the jack-screws which\nare used in stowing cotton.  Each morning we went ashore, and beat\nand brought off as many hides as we could steeve in the course of\nthe day, and, after breakfast, went down into the hold, where we\nremained at work until night.  The whole length of the hold, from\nstem to stern, was floored off level, and we began with raising\na pile in the after part, hard against the bulkhead of the run,\nand filling it up to the beams, crowding in as many as we could\nby hand and pushing in with oars; when a large “book” was made\nof from twenty-five to fifty hides, doubled at the backs, and put\ninto one another, like the leaves of a book.  An opening was then\nmade between two hides in the pile, and the back of the outside\nhide of the book inserted.  Two long, heavy spars, called steeves,\nmade of the strongest wood, and sharpened off like a wedge at\none end, were placed with their wedge ends into the inside of\nthe hide which was the centre of the book, and to the other end\nof each, straps were fitted, into which large tackles were hooked,\ncomposed each of two huge purchase blocks, one hooked to the strap\non the end of the steeve, and the other into a dog, fastened into\none of the beams, as far aft as it could be got.  When this was\narranged, and the ways greased upon which the book was to slide,\nthe falls of the tackles were stretched forward, and all hands\ntallied on, and bowsed away until the book was well entered;\nwhen these tackles were nippered, straps and toggles clapped\nupon the falls, and two more luff tackles hooked on, with dogs,\nin the same manner; and thus, by luff upon luff, the power was\nmultiplied, until into a pile in which one hide more could not\nbe crowded by hand, an hundred or an hundred and fifty were often\ndriven in by this complication of purchases.  When the last luff\nwas hooked on, all hands were called to the rope–cook, steward,\nand all–and ranging ourselves at the falls, one behind the other,\nsitting down on the hides, with our heads just even with the beams,\nwe set taught upon the tackles, and striking up a song, and all\nlying back at the chorus, we bowsed the tackles home, and drove\nthe large books chock in out of sight.",
        "The sailor’s songs for capstans and falls are of a peculiar kind,\nhaving a chorus at the end of each line.  The burden is usually\nsung, by one alone, and, at the chorus, all hands join in,–and\nthe louder the noise, the better.  With us, the chorus seemed\nalmost to raise the decks of the ship, and might be heard at\na great distance, ashore.  A song is as necessary to sailors\nas the drum and fife to a soldier.  They can’t pull in time,\nor pull with a will, without it.  Many a time, when a thing\ngoes heavy, with one fellow yo-ho-ing, a lively song, like “Heave,\nto the girls!”  “Nancy oh!”  “Jack Cross-tree,” etc., has put life\nand strength into every arm. We often found a great difference in\nthe effect of the different songs in driving in the hides.  Two or\nthree songs would be tried, one after the other; with no effect;–not\nan inch could be got upon the tackles–when a new song, struck up,\nseemed to hit the humor of the moment, and drove the tackles “two\nblocks” at once. “Heave round hearty!”  “Captain gone ashore!” and\nthe like, might do for common pulls, but in an emergency, when we\nwanted a heavy, “raise-the-dead” pull, which should start the beams\nof the ship, there was nothing like “Time for us to go!”  “Round\nthe corner,” or “Hurrah! hurrah! my hearty bullies!”",
        "This was the most lively part of our work.  A little boating and\nbeach work in the morning; then twenty or thirty men down in a\nclose hold, where we were obliged to sit down and slide about,\npassing hides, and rowsing about the great steeves, tackles,\nand dogs, singing out at the falls, and seeing the ship filling up\nevery day.  The work was as hard as it could well be.  There was\nnot a moment’s cessation from Monday morning till Saturday night,\nwhen we were generally beaten out, and glad to have a full night’s\nrest, a wash and shift of clothes, and a quiet Sunday.  During all\nthis time,–which would have startled Dr. Graham–we lived upon\nalmost nothing but fresh beef; fried beefsteaks, three times a\nday,–morning, noon, and night.  At morning and night we had a\nquart of tea to each man; and an allowance of about a pound of\nhard bread a day; but our chief article of food was the beef.\nA mess, consisting of six men, had a large wooden kid piled up\nwith beefsteaks, cut thick, and fried in fat, with the grease\npoured over them.  Round this we sat, attacking it with our\njack-knives and teeth, and with the appetite of young lions,\nand sent back an empty kid to the galley.  This was done three\ntimes a day.  How many pounds each man ate in a day, I will not\nattempt to compute.  A whole bullock (we ate liver and all) lasted\nus but four days.  Such devouring of flesh, I will venture to say,\nwas seldom known before.  What one man ate in a day, over a hearty\nman’s allowance, would make a Russian’s heart leap into his mouth.\nIndeed, during all the time we were upon the coast, our principal\nfood was fresh beef, and every man had perfect health; but this\nwas a time of especial devouring; and what we should have done\nwithout meat, I cannot tell.  Once or twice, when our bullocks\nfailed and we were obliged to make a meal upon dry bread and\nwater, it seemed like feeding upon shavings.  Light and dry,\nfeeling unsatisfied, and, at the same time, full, we were glad\nto see four quarters of a bullock, just killed, swinging from\nthe fore-top.  Whatever theories may be started by sedentary\nmen, certainly no men could have gone through more hard work and\nexposure for sixteen months in more perfect health, and without\nailings and failings, than our ship’s crew, let them have lived\nupon Hygeia’s own baking and dressing.",
        "Friday, April 15th.  Arrived, brig Pilgrim, from the windward.\nIt was a sad sight for her crew to see us getting ready to go off\nthe coast, while they, who had been longer on the coast than the\nAlert, were condemned to another year’s hard service.  I spent an\nevening on board, and found them making the best of the matter,\nand determined to rough it out as they might; but my friend S––-\nwas determined to go home in the ship, if money or interest could\nbring it to pass.  After considerable negotiating and working,\nhe succeeded in persuading my English friend, Tom Harris,–my\ncompanion in the anchor watch–for thirty dollars, some clothes,\nand an intimation from Captain Faucon that he should want a second\nmate before the voyage was up, to take his place in the brig as\nsoon as she was ready to go up to windward. ",
        "The first opportunity I could get to speak to Captain Faucon,\nI asked him to step up to the oven and look at Hope, whom he\nknew well, having had him on board his vessel.  He went to\nsee him, but said that he had so little medicine, and expected\nto be so long on the coast, that he could do nothing for him,\nbut that Captain Arthur would take care of him when he came down\nin the California, which would be in a week or more.  I had been\nto see Hope the first night after we got into San Diego this last\ntime, and had frequently since spent the early part of a night in\nthe oven.  I hardly expected, when I left him to go to windward,\nto find him alive upon my return.  He was certainly as low as he\ncould well be when I left him, and what would be the effect of the\nmedicines that I gave him, I hardly then dared to conjecture. \nYet I knew that he must die without them.  I was not a little\nrejoiced, therefore, and relieved, upon our return, to see him\ndecidedly better.  The medicines were strong, and took hold and\ngave a check to the disorder which was destroying him; and, more\nthan that, they had begun the work of exterminating it.  I shall\nnever forget the gratitude that he expressed.  All the Kanakas\nattributed his escape solely to my knowledge, and would not be\npersuaded that I had not all the secrets of the physical system\nopen to me and under my control.  My medicines, however, were gone,\nand no more could be got from the ship, so that his life was left\nto hang upon the arrival of the California.",
        "Sunday, April 24th.  We had now been nearly seven weeks in San Diego,\nand had taken in the greater part of our cargo, and were looking out,\nevery day, for the arrival of the California, which had our agent\non board; when, this afternoon, some Kanakas, who had been over\nthe hill for rabbits and to fight rattlesnakes, came running down\nthe path, singing out, “Kail ho!” with all their might.  Mr. H.,\nour third mate, was ashore, and asking them particularly about\nthe size of the sail, etc., and learning that it was “Moku–Nui\nMoku,” hailed our ship, and said that the California was on the\nother side of the point.  Instantly, all hands were turned up,\nthe bow guns run out and loaded, the ensign and broad pennant set,\nthe yards squared by lifts and braces, and everything got ready to\nmake a good appearance.  The instant she showed her nose round\nthe point, we began our salute.  She came in under top-gallant\nsails, clewed up and furled her sails in good order, and came-to,\nwithin good swinging distance of us.  It being Sunday, and nothing\nto do, all hands were on the forecastle, criticising the new-comer. \nShe was a good, substantial ship, not quite so long as the Alert,\nand wall-sided and kettle-bottomed, after the latest fashion of\nsouth-shore cotton and sugar wagons; strong, too, and tight, and a\ngood average sailor, but with no pretensions to beauty, and nothing\nin the style of a “crack ship.”  Upon the whole, we were perfectly\nsatisfied that the Alert might hold up her head with a ship twice\nas smart as she. ",
        "At night, some of us got a boat and went on board, and found\na large, roomy forecastle, (for she was squarer forward than\nthe Alert,) and a crew of a dozen or fifteen men and boys,\nsitting around on their chests, smoking and talking, and ready\nto give a welcome to any of our ship’s company.  It was just\nseven months since they left Boston, which seemed but yesterday\nto us.  Accordingly, we had much to ask, for though we had seen\nthe newspapers that she brought, yet these were the very men who\nhad been in Boston and seen everything with their own eyes.  One of\nthe green-hands was a Boston boy, from one of the public schools,\nand, of course, knew many things which we wished to ask about, and\non inquiring the names of our two Boston boys, found that they had\nbeen schoolmates of his.  Our men had hundreds of questions to ask\nabout Ann street, the boarding-houses, the ships in port, the rate\nof wages, and other matters. ",
        "Among her crew were two English man-of-war’s-men, so that, of course,\nwe soon had music.  They sang in the true sailor’s style, and the\nrest of the crew, which was a remarkably musical one, joined in the\nchoruses.  They had many of the latest sailor songs, which had not\nyet got about among our merchantmen, and which they were very choice\nof.  They began soon after we came on board, and kept it up until\nafter two bells, when the second mate came forward and called “the\nAlerts away!”  Battle-songs, drinking-songs, boat-songs, love-songs,\nand everything else, they seemed to have a complete assortment of,\nand I was glad to find that “All in the Downs,” “Poor Tom Bowline,\"\n“The Bay of Biscay,” “List, ye Landsmen!” and all those classical\nsongs of the sea, still held their places.  In addition to these,\nthey had picked up at the theatres and other places a few songs of\na little more genteel cast, which they were very proud of; and I\nshall never forget hearing an old salt, who had broken his voice\nby hard drinking on shore, and bellowing from the mast-head in a\nhundred northwesters, with all manner of ungovernable trills and\nquavers in the high notes, breaking into a rough falsetto–and in\nthe low ones, growling along like the dying away of the boatswain’s\n“all hands ahoy!” down the hatch-way, singing, “Oh, no, we never\nmention him.” ",
        "“Perhaps, like me, he struggles with\nEach feeling of regret;\nBut if he’s loved as I have loved,\nHe never can forget!” ",
        "The last line, being the conclusion, he roared out at the top of\nhis voice, breaking each word up into half a dozen syllables. \nThis was very popular, and Jack was called upon every night to\ngive them his “sentimental song.”  No one called for it more\nloudly than I, for the complete absurdity of the execution,\nand the sailors’ perfect satisfaction in it, were ludicrous\nbeyond measure. ",
        "The next day, the California commenced unloading her cargo; and\nher boats’ crews, in coming and going, sang their boat-songs,\nkeeping time with their oars.  This they did all day long for\nseveral days, until their hides were all discharged, when a gang\nof them were sent on board the Alert, to help us steeve our hides. \nThis was a windfall for us, for they had a set of new songs for the\ncapstan and fall, and ours had got nearly worn out by six weeks’\nconstant use.  I have no doubt that this timely reinforcement of\nsongs hastened our work several days. ",
        "Our cargo was now nearly all taken in; and my old friend, the Pilgrim,\nhaving completed her discharge, unmoored, to set sail the next morning\non another long trip to windward.  I was just thinking of her hard\nlot, and congratulating myself upon my escape from her, when I\nreceived a summons into the cabin.  I went aft, and there found,\nseated round the cabin table, my own captain, Captain Faucon of\nthe Pilgrim, and Mr. R––-, the agent.  Captain T––- turned\nto me and asked abruptly–",
        "“D––-, do you want to go home in the ship?” ",
        "“Certainly, sir,” said I; “I expect to go home in the ship.” ",
        "“Then,” said he, “you must get some one to go in your place on\nboard the Pilgrim.” ",
        "I was so completely “taken aback” by this sudden intimation, that for\na moment I could make no reply.  I knew that it would be hopeless to\nattempt to prevail upon any of the ship’s crew to take twelve months\nmore upon the California in the brig.  I knew, too, that Captain\nT––- had received orders to bring me home in the Alert, and he\nhad told me, when I was at the hide-house, that I was to go home\nin her; and even if this had not been so, it was cruel to give me\nno notice of the step they were going to take, until a few hours\nbefore the brig would sail.  As soon as I had got my wits about me,\nI put on a bold front, and told him plainly that I had a letter in\nmy chest informing me that he had been written to, by the owners\nin Boston, to bring me home in the ship, and moreover, that he\nhad told me that I was to go in the ship. ",
        "To have this told him, and to be opposed in such a manner, was more\nthan my lord paramount had been used to. ",
        "He turned fiercely upon me, and tried to look me down, and face me\nout of my statement; but finding that that wouldn’t do, and that I\nwas entering upon my defence in such a way as would show to the other\ntwo that he was in the wrong,–he changed his ground, and pointed\nto the shipping papers of the Pilgrim, from which my name had never\nbeen erased, and said that there was my name,–that I belonged to\nher,–that he had an absolute discretionary power,–and, in short,\nthat I must be on board the Pilgrim by the next morning with my chest\nand hammock, or have some one ready to go in my place, and that he\nwould not hear another word from me.  No court or star chamber could\nproceed more summarily with a poor devil, than this trio was about\nto do with me; condemning me to a punishment worse than a Botany\nBay exile, and to a fate which would alter the whole current of\nmy future life; for two years more in California would have made\nme a sailor for the rest of my days.  I felt all this, and saw\nthe necessity of being determined.  I repeated what I had said,\nand insisted upon my right to return in the ship. ",
        "I “raised my arm, and tauld my crack,\nBefore them a’.” ",
        "But it would have all availed me nothing, had I been “some poor\nbody,” before this absolute, domineering tribunal.  But they saw\nthat I would not go, unless “vi et armis,” and they knew that I\nhad friends and interest enough at home to make them suffer for\nany injustice they might do me.  It was probably this that turned\nthe matter; for the captain changed his tone entirely, and asked\nme if, in case any one went in my place, I would give him the same\nsum that S––- gave Harris to exchange with him.  I told him that\nif any one was sent on board the brig, I should pity him, and be\nwilling to help him to that, or almost any amount; but would not\nspeak of it as an exchange. ",
        "“Very well,” said he.  “Go forward about your business, and send\nEnglish Ben here to me!” ",
        "I went forward with a light heart, but feeling as angry, and as\nmuch contempt as I could well contain between my teeth.  English Ben\nwas sent aft, and in a few moments came forward, looking as though\nhe had received his sentence to be hung.  The captain had told him\nto get his things ready to go on board the brig the next morning;\nand that I would give him thirty dollars and a suit of clothes. \nThe hands had “knocked off” for dinner, and were standing about the\nforecastle, when Ben came forward and told his story.  I could see\nplainly that it made a great excitement, and that, unless I explained\nthe matter to them, the feeling would be turned against me.  Ben was a\npoor English boy, a stranger in Boston, and without friends or money;\nand being an active, willing lad, and a good sailor for his years,\nwas a general favorite.  “Oh, yes!” said the crew, “the captain\nhas let you off, because you are a gentleman’s son, and have got\nfriends, and know the owners; and taken Ben, because he is poor,\nand has got nobody to say a word for him!”  I knew that this was too\ntrue to be answered, but I excused myself from any blame, and told\nthem that I had a right to go home, at all events.  This pacified\nthem a little, but Jack had got a notion that a poor lad was to be\nimposed upon, and did not distinguish very clearly; and though I\nknew that I was in no fault, and, in fact, had barely escaped the\ngrossest injustice, yet I felt that my berth was getting to be a\ndisagreeable one.  The notion that I was not “one of them,” which,\nby a participation in all their labor and hardships, and having no\nfavor shown me, had been laid asleep, was beginning to revive.\nBut far stronger than any feeling for myself, was the pity I felt\nfor the poor lad.  He had depended upon going home in the ship;\nand from Boston, was going immediately to Liverpool, to see his\nfriends.  Beside this, having begun the voyage with very few clothes,\nhe had taken up the greater part of his wages in the slop-chest,\nand it was every day a losing concern to him; and, like all the\nrest of the crew, he had a hearty hatred of California, and the\nprospect of eighteen months or two years more of hide-droghing\nseemed completely to break down his spirit.  I had determined\nnot to go myself, happen what would, and I knew that the captain\nwould not dare to attempt to force me. I knew, too, that the two\ncaptains had agreed together to get some one, and that unless I\ncould prevail upon somebody to go voluntarily, there would be no\nhelp for Ben.  From this consideration, though I had said that I\nwould have nothing to do with an exchange, I did my best to get\nsome one to go voluntarily.  I offered to give an order upon the\nowners in Boston for six months’ wages, and also all the clothes,\nbooks, and other matters, which I should not want upon the voyage\nhome.  When this offer was published in the ship, and the case of\npoor Ben was set forth in strong colors, several, who would not\nhave dreamed of going themselves, were busy in talking it up to\nothers, who, they thought, might be tempted to accept it; and,\nat length, one fellow, a harum-scarum lad, whom we called Harry\nBluff, and who did not care what country or ship he was in, if he\nhad clothes enough and money enough–partly from pity for Ben,\nand partly from the thought he should have “cruising money” for\nthe rest of his stay,–came forward, and offered to go and “sling\nhis hammock in the bloody hooker.”  Lest his purpose should cool,\nI signed an order for the sum upon the owners in Boston, gave him\nall the clothes I could spare, and sent him aft to the captain,\nto let him know what had been done.  The skipper accepted the\nexchange, and was, doubtless, glad to have it pass off so easily.\nAt the same time he cashed the order, which was endorsed to him,(1)",
        "–––––––-\n1. When the crew were paid off in Boston, the owners answered\nthe order, but generously refused to deduct the amount from the\npay-roll, saying that the exchange was made under compulsion. \nThey also allowed S––- his exchange money. \n–––––––-",
        "and the next morning, the lad went aboard the brig, apparently in\ngood spirits, having shaken hands with each of us and wished us a\npleasant passage home, jingling the money in his pockets, and calling\nout, “Never say die, while there’s a shot in the locker.”  The same\nboat carried off Harris, my old watchmate, who had previously made\nan exchange with my friend S––-.",
        "I was sorry to part with Harris.  Nearly two hundred hours (as we\nhad calculated it) had we walked the ship’s deck together, at anchor\nwatch, when all hands were below, and talked over and over every\nsubject which came within the ken of either of us.  He gave me a\nstrong gripe with his hand; and I told him, if he came to Boston\nagain, not to fail to find me out, and let me see an old watchmate. \nThe same boat brought on board S––-, my friend, who had begun\nthe voyage with me from Boston, and, like me, was going back to\nhis family and to the society which we had been born and brought\nup in.  We congratulated one another upon finding what we had\nlong talked over and wished for, thus brought about; and none on\nboard the ship were more glad than ourselves to see the old brig\nstanding round the point, under full sail.  As she passed abreast\nof us, we all collected in the waist, and gave her three loud,\nhearty cheers, waving our hats in the air.  Her crew sprang\ninto the rigging and chains, answered us with three as loud,\nto which we, after the nautical custom, gave one in return. \nI took my last look of their familiar faces as they got over the\nrail, and saw the old black cook put his head out of the galley,\nand wave his cap over his head.  The crew flew aloft to loose the\ntop-gallant sails and royals; the two captains waved their hands\nto one another; and, in ten minutes, we saw the last inch of her\nwhite canvas, as she rounded the point. ",
        "Relieved as I was to see her well off, (and I felt like one who had\njust sprung from an iron trap which was closing upon him) I had yet a\nfeeling of regret at taking the last look at the old craft in which I\nhad spent a year, and the first year, of my sailor’s life–which had\nbeen my first home in the new world into which I had entered–and\nwith which I had associated so many things,–my first leaving home,\nmy first crossing the equator, Cape Horn, Juan Fernandez, death at\nsea, and other things, serious and common.  Yet, with all this,\nand the feeling I had for my old shipmates, condemned to another\nterm of California life, the thought that we were done with it,\nand that one week more would see us on our way to Boston, was a\ncure for everything.",
        "Friday, May 6th, completed the taking of our cargo, and was a\nmemorable day in our calendar.  The time when we were to take\nin our last hide, we had looked forward to, for sixteen months,\nas the first bright spot.  When the last hide was stowed away,\nand the hatches calked down, the tarpaulins battened on to them,\nthe long-boat hoisted in and secured, and the decks swept down for\nthe night,–the chief mate sprang upon the top of the long-boat,\ncalled all hands into the waist, and giving us a signal by swinging\nhis cap over his head,–we gave three long, loud cheers, which came\nfrom the bottom of our hearts, and made the hills and valleys\nring again.  In a moment, we heard three, in answer, from the\nCalifornia’s crew, who had seen us taking in our long-boat,\nand–\"the cry they heard–its meaning knew.”",
        "The last week, we had been occupied in taking in a supply of\nwood and water for the passage home, and bringing on board the\nspare spars, sails, etc.  I was sent off with a party of Indians\nto fill the water-casks, at a spring, about three miles from the\nshipping, and near the town, and was absent three days, living at the\ntown, and spending the daytime in filling the casks and transporting\nthem on ox-carts to the landing-place, whence they were taken on\nboard by the crew with boats.  This being all done with, we gave\none day to bending our sails; and at night, every sail, from the\ncourses to the skysails, was bent, and every studding-sail ready\nfor setting.",
        "Before our sailing, an unsuccessful attempt was made by one of\nthe crew of the California to effect an exchange with one of our\nnumber.  It was a lad, between fifteen and sixteen years of age,\nwho went by the name of the “reefer,” having been a midshipman in\nan East India Company’s ship.  His singular character and story\nhad excited our interest ever since the ship came into the port.\nHe was a delicate, slender little fellow, with a beautiful pearly\ncomplexion, regular features, forehead as white as marble, black\nhaired, curling beautifully, rounded, tapering, delicate fingers,\nsmall feet, soft voice, gentle manners, and, in fact, every sign\nof having been well born and bred.  At the same time there was\nsomething in his expression which showed a slight deficiency of\nintellect.  How great the deficiency was, or what it resulted from;\nwhether he was born so; whether it was the result of disease or\naccident; or whether, as some said, it was brought on by his\ndistress of mind, during the voyage, I cannot say.  From his own\naccount of himself, and from many circumstances which were known\nin connection with his story, he must have been the son of a man\nof wealth.  His mother was an Italian woman.  He was probably a\nnatural son, for in scarcely any other way could the incidents\nof his early life be accounted for.  He said that his parents did\nnot live together, and he seemed to have been ill treated by his\nfather.  Though he had been delicately brought up, and indulged\nin every way, (and he had then with him trinkets which had been\ngiven him at home,) yet his education had been sadly neglected;\nand when only twelve years old, he was sent as midshipman in the\nCompany’s service.  His own story was, that he afterwards ran\naway from home, upon a difficulty which he had with his father,\nand went to Liverpool, whence he sailed in the ship Rialto,\nCaptain Holmes, for Boston.  Captain Holmes endeavored to get\nhim a passage back, but there being no vessel to sail for some\ntime, the boy left him, and went to board at a common sailor’s\nboarding-house, in Ann street, where he supported himself for a\nfew weeks by selling some of his valuables.  At length, according\nto his own account, being desirous of returning home, he went to\na shipping-office, where the shipping articles of the California\nwere open.  Upon asking where the ship was going, he was told by\nthe shipping-master that she was bound to California.  Not knowing\nwhere that was, he told him that he wanted to go to Europe, and\nasked if California was in Europe.  The shipping-master answered\nhim in a way which the boy did not understand, and advised him to\nship.  The boy signed the articles, received his advance, laid out\na little of it in clothes, and spent the rest, and was ready to\ngo on board, when, upon the morning of sailing, he heard that the\nship was bound upon the North-west Coast, on a two or three years’\nvoyage, and was not going to Europe.  Frightened at this prospect,\nhe slipped away when the crew was going aboard, wandered up into\nanother part of the town, and spent all the forenoon in straying\nabout the common, and the neighboring streets.",
        "Having no money, and all his clothes and other things being in\nthe chest, on board, and being a stranger, he became tired and\nhungry, and ventured down toward the shipping, to see if the vessel\nhad sailed.  He was just turning the corner of a street, when the\nshipping-master, who had been in search of him, popped upon him,\nseized him, and carried him on board.  He cried and struggled,\nand said he did not wish to go in the ship, but the topsails\nwere at the mast-head, the fasts just ready to be cast off, and\neverything in the hurry and confusion of departure, so that he was\nhardly noticed; and the few who did inquire about the matter were\ntold that it was merely a boy who had spent his advance and tried\nto run away.  Had the owners of the vessel known anything of the\nmatter, they would have interfered at once; but they either knew\nnothing of it, or heard, like the rest, that it was only an unruly\nboy who was sick of his bargain.  As soon as the boy found himself\nactually at sea, and upon a voyage of two or three years in length,\nhis spirits failed him; he refused to work, and became so miserable,\nthat Captain Arthur took him into the cabin, where he assisted\nthe steward, and occasionally pulled and hauled about decks.\nHe was in this capacity when we saw him; and though it was\nmuch better for him than the life in the forecastle, and the\nhard work, watching, and exposure, which his delicate frame could\nnot have borne, yet, to be joined with a black fellow in waiting\nupon a man whom he probably looked upon as but little, in point\nof education and manners, above one of his father’s servants, was\nalmost too much for his spirit to bear.  Had he entered upon his\nsituation of his own free will, he could have endured it; but to\nhave been deceived, and, in addition to that, forced into it,\nwas intolerable.  He made every effort to go home in our ship,\nbut his captain refused to part with him except in the way of\nexchange, and that he could not effect.  If this account of the\nwhole matter, which we had from the boy, and which was confirmed\nby all the crew, be correct, I cannot understand why Captain Arthur\nshould have refused to let him go, especially being a captain who\nhad the name, not only with that crew, but with all whom he had\never commanded, of an unusually kind-hearted man.",
        "The truth is, the unlimited power which merchant captains have, upon\nlong voyages on strange coasts, takes away a sense of responsibility,\nand too often, even in men otherwise well-disposed, substitutes\na disregard for the rights and feelings of others.  The lad was\nsent on shore to join the gang at the hide-house; from whence,\nI was afterwards rejoiced to hear, he effected his escape, and\nwent down to Callao in a small Spanish schooner; and from Callao,\nhe probably returned to England.",
        "Soon after the arrival of the California, I spoke to Captain Arthur\nabout Hope; and as he had known him on the voyage before, and was\nvery fond of him, he immediately went to see him, gave him proper\nmedicines, and, under such care, he began rapidly to recover.  The\nSaturday night before our sailing, I spent an hour in the oven,\nand took leave of my Kanaka friends; and, really, this was the\nonly thing connected with leaving California which was in any\nway unpleasant.  I felt an interest and affection for many of\nthese simple, true-hearted men, such as I never felt before\nbut for a near relation.  Hope shook me by the hand, said he\nshould soon be well again, and ready to work for me when I came\nupon the coast, next voyage, as officer of the ship; and told me\nnot to forget, when I became captain, how to be kind to the sick.\nOld “Mr. Bingham” and “King Mannini” went down to the boat with me,\nshook me heartily by the hand, wished us a good voyage, and went back\nto the oven, chanting one of their deep monotonous songs, the burden\nof which I gathered to be about us and our voyage.",
        "Sunday, May 8th.  This promised to be our last day in California. ",
        "Our forty thousand hides, thirty thousand horns, besides several\nbarrels of otter and beaver skins, were all stowed below, and the\nhatches calked down.  All our spare spars were taken on board and\nlashed; our water-casks secured; and our live stock, consisting\nof four bullocks, a dozen sheep, a dozen or more pigs, and three\nor four dozen of poultry, were all stowed away in their different\nquarters: the bullocks in the long-boat, the sheep in a pen on the\nfore-hatch, and the pigs in a sty under the bows of the long-boat,\nand the poultry in their proper coop; and the jolly-boat was full\nof hay for the sheep and bullocks.  Our unusually large cargo,\ntogether with the stores for a five months’ voyage, brought the\nship channels down into the water.  In addition to this, she had\nbeen steeved so thoroughly, and was so bound by the compression of\nher cargo, forced into her by so powerful machinery, that she was\nlike a man in a straight-jacket, and would be but a dull sailer,\nuntil she had worked herself loose.",
        "The California had finished discharging her cargo, and was to get\nunder weigh at the same time with us.  Having washed down decks and\ngot our breakfast, the two vessels lay side by side, in complete\nreadiness for sea, our ensigns hanging from the peaks, and our\ntall spars reflected from the glassy surface of the river, which,\nsince sunrise, had been unbroken by a ripple.  At length, a few\nwhiffs came across the water, and, by eleven o’clock, the regular\nnorth-west wind set steadily in.  There was no need of calling\nall hands, for we had all been hanging about the forecastle the\nwhole forenoon, and were ready for a start upon the first sign\nof a breeze.",
        "All eyes were aft upon the captain, who was walking the deck,\nwith, every now and then, a look to windward.  He made a sign\nto the mate, who came forward, took his station, deliberately\nbetween the knight-heads, cast a glance aloft, and called out,\n“All hands, lay aloft and loose the sails!”  We were half in the\nrigging before the order came, and never since we left Boston\nwere the gaskets off the yards, and the rigging overhauled, in a\nshorter time.  “All ready forward, sir!\"–\"All ready the main!\"–\n“Cross-jack yards all ready, sir!\"–\"Lay down, all hands but one\non each yard!”  The yard-arm and bunt gaskets were cast off; and\neach sail hung by the jigger, with one man standing by the tie to\nlet it go.  At the same moment that we sprang aloft, a dozen hands\nsprang into the rigging of the California, and in an instant were\nall over her yards; and her sails, too, were ready to be dropped at\nthe word.  In the mean time our bow gun had been loaded and run out,\nand its discharge was to be the signal for dropping sails.  A cloud\nof smoke came out of our bows; the echoes of the gun rattled our\nfarewell among the hills of California; and the two ships were\ncovered, from head to foot, with their white canvas.  For a few\nminutes, all was uproar and apparent confusion: men flying about\nlike monkeys in the rigging; ropes and blocks flying; orders given\nand answered, and the confused noises of men singing out at the\nropes.  The top-sails came to the mast-heads with “Cheerily,\nmen!” and, in a few minutes, every sail was set; for the wind\nwas light.  The head sails were backed, the windlass came round\n“slip-slap” to the cry of the sailors;–\"Hove short, sir,” said\nthe mate;–\"Up with him!\"–\"Aye, aye, sir.\"–A few hearty and long\nheaves, and the anchor showed its head.  “Hook cat!\"–The fall was\nstretched along the decks; all hands laid hold;–\"Hurrah, for the\nlast time,” said the mate; and the anchor came to the cat-head to\nthe tune of “Time for us to go,” with a loud chorus.  Everything\nwas done quick, as though it were for the last time.  The head\nyards were filled away, and our ship began to move through the\nwater on her homeward-bound course.",
        "The California had got under weigh at the same moment; and we\nsailed down the narrow bay abreast and were just off the mouth,\nand finding ourselves gradually shooting ahead of her, were on\nthe point of giving her three parting cheers, when, suddenly, we\nfound ourselves stopped short, and the California ranging fast\nahead of us.  A bar stretches across the mouth of the harbor,\nwith water enough to float common vessels, but, being low in\nthe water, and having kept well to leeward, as we were bound\nto the southward, we had stuck fast, while the California,\nbeing light, had floated over.",
        "We kept all sail on, in the hope of forcing over, but failing in\nthis, we hove aback, and lay waiting for the tide, which was on\nthe flood, to take us back into the channel.  This was somewhat\nof a damper to us, and the captain looked not a little mortified\nand vexed.  “This is the same place where the Rosa got ashore,\"\nobserved the redheaded second mate, most mal-a-propos.  A malediction\non the Rosa, and him too, was all the answer he got, and he slunk\noff to leeward.  In a few minutes, the force of the wind and the\nrising of the tide backed us into the stream, and we were on our\nway to our old anchoring-place, the tide setting swiftly up, and\nthe ship barely manageable, in the light breeze.  We came-to, in\nour old berth, opposite the hide-house, whose inmates were not a\nlittle surprised to see us return.  We felt as though we were tied\nto California; and some of the crew swore that they never should\nget clear of the bloody coast.",
        "In about half an hour, which was near high water, the order was\ngiven to man the windlass, and again the anchor was catted; but not\na word was said about the last time.  The California had come back\non finding that we had returned, and was hove-to, waiting for us,\noff the point.  This time we passed the bar safely, and were soon\nup with the California, who filled away, and kept us company.",
        "She seemed desirous of a trial of speed, and our captain accepted\nthe challenge, although we were loaded down to the bolts of\nour chain plates, as deep as a sand-barge, and bound so taught\nwith our cargo that we were no more fit for a race than a man\nin fetters;–while our antagonist was in her best trim.  Being\nclear of the point, the breeze became stiff, and the royal masts\nbent under our sails, but we would not take them in until we saw\nthree boys spring aloft into the rigging of the California; when\nthey were all furled at once, but with orders to stay aloft at the\ntop-gallant mastheads, and loose them again at the word.  It was\nmy duty to furl the fore royal; and while standing by to loose\nit again, I had a fine view of the scene.  From where I stood,\nthe two vessels seemed nothing but spars and sails, while their\nnarrow decks, far below, slanting over by the force of the wind\naloft, appeared hardly capable of supporting the great fabrics\nraised upon them.  The California was to windward of us, and had\nevery advantage; yet, while the breeze was stiff, we held our\nown.  As soon as it began to slacken, she ranged a little ahead,\nand the order was given to loose the royals.  In an instant the\ngaskets were off and the bunt dropped.  “Sheet home the fore royal!\n–Weather sheet’s home!\"–\"Hoist away, sir!” is bawled from aloft.\n“Overhaul your clew-lines!” shouts the mate.  “Aye, aye, sir, all\nclear!\"–\"Taught leech! belay!  Well the lee brace; haul taught to\nwindward\"–and the royals are set.  These brought us up again; but\nthe wind continuing light, the California set hers, and it was soon\nevident that she was walking away from us.  Our captain then hailed,\nand said that he should keep off to his course; adding–\"She isn’t\nthe Alert now.  If I had her in your trim, she would have been out\nof sight by this time.”  This was good-naturedly answered from the\nCalifornia, and she braced sharp up, and stood close upon the wind\nup the coast; while we squared away our yards, and stood before the\nwind to the south-south-west.  The California’s crew manned her\nweather rigging, waved their hats in the air, and gave up three\nhearty cheers, which we answered as heartily, and the customary\nsingle cheer came back to us from over the water.  She stood on\nher way, doomed to eighteen months’ or two years’ hard service upon\nthat hated coast, while we were making our way to our home, to which\nevery hour and every mile was bringing us nearer.",
        "As soon as we parted company with the California, all hands were\nsent aloft to set the studding-sails.  Booms were rigged out,\ntacks and halyards rove, sail after sail packed upon her, until\nevery available inch of canvas was spread, that we might not lose a\nbreath of the fair wind.  We could now see how much she was cramped\nand deadened by her cargo; for with a good breeze on her quarter,\nand every stitch of canvas spread, we could not get more than six\nknots out of her.  She had no more life in her than if she were\nwater-logged.  The log was hove several times; but she was doing\nher best.  We had hardly patience with her, but the older sailors\nsaid–\"Stand by! you’ll see her work herself loose in a week\nor two, and then she’ll walk up to Cape Horn like a race-horse.”",
        "When all sail had been set, and the decks cleared up, the California\nwas a speck in the horizon, and the coast lay like a low cloud along\nthe north-east.  At sunset they were both out of sight, and we were\nonce more upon the ocean where sky and water meet.",
