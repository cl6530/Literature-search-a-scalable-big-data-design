        "Like the rivers, forever running yet never passed, like the winds\nforever going yet never gone, so is Odd-Fellowship.",
        "“I have lived much that I have not written, but I have written nothing\nthat I have not lived, and the story of this book is but a plaintive\nrefrain wrung from the over-burdened song of my life; while the tides\nof feeling, winding down the lines, had their sources in as many broken\nupheavals of my own heart.”  A book, like an implement, must be judged\nby its adaptation to its special design, however unfit for any other\nend.  This volume is designed to help Odd-Fellows in their search for\nthe good things in life.  There is need of something to break the spell\nof indifference that oftentimes binds us, and to open glimpses of\nbetter, sweeter, grander possibilities.  Hence this volume, which is a\nplea for that great fortune of man–his own nature.  Bulwer says:\n“Strive while improving your one talent to enrich your whole capital as\na man.” The present work is designed to aid in securing the result thus\nrecommended.  We send it forth, trusting that it will find its way into\nthe hands of every Odd-Fellow and every Odd-Fellow’s friend and\nneighbor, and that those who read it will gather from its pages lessons\nwhich shall enable them to pluck thorns from their pathway and scatter\nflowers instead.",
