        "This translation was suggested not by any pretensions to range myself\namong the ranks of the body of sinologues, but by the perplexities and\ndifficulties experienced by me as a student in Peking, when, at the\ncompletion of the Tzu Erh Chi, I had to plunge in the maze of the Hung\nLou Meng.",
        "Shortcomings are, I feel sure, to be discovered, both in the prose, as\nwell as among the doggerel and uncouth rhymes, in which the text has\nbeen more adhered to than rhythm; but I shall feel satisfied with the\nresult, if I succeed, even in the least degree, in affording a helping\nhand to present and future students of the Chinese language.",
        "H. Bencraft Joly, H.B.M. Vice-Consulate, Macao, 1st September, 1891.",
        "  Chen Shih-yin, in a vision, apprehends perception and spirituality.\n  Chia Yü-ts’un, in the (windy and dusty) world, cherishes fond thoughts\n      of a beautiful maiden.",
        "This is the opening section; this the first chapter. Subsequent to the\nvisions of a dream which he had, on some previous occasion, experienced,\nthe writer personally relates, he designedly concealed the true\ncircumstances, and borrowed the attributes of perception and\nspirituality to relate this story of the Record of the Stone. With this\npurpose, he made use of such designations as Chen Shih-yin (truth under\nthe garb of fiction) and the like. What are, however, the events\nrecorded in this work? Who are the dramatis personae?",
        "Wearied with the drudgery experienced of late in the world, the author\nspeaking for himself, goes on to explain, with the lack of success which\nattended every single concern, I suddenly bethought myself of the\nwomankind of past ages. Passing one by one under a minute scrutiny, I\nfelt that in action and in lore, one and all were far above me; that in\nspite of the majesty of my manliness, I could not, in point of fact,\ncompare with these characters of the gentle sex. And my shame forsooth\nthen knew no bounds; while regret, on the other hand, was of no avail,\nas there was not even a remote possibility of a day of remedy.",
        "On this very day it was that I became desirous to compile, in a\nconnected form, for publication throughout the world, with a view to\n(universal) information, how that I bear inexorable and manifold\nretribution; inasmuch as what time, by the sustenance of the benevolence\nof Heaven, and the virtue of my ancestors, my apparel was rich and fine,\nand as what days my fare was savory and sumptuous, I disregarded the\nbounty of education and nurture of father and mother, and paid no heed\nto the virtue of precept and injunction of teachers and friends, with\nthe result that I incurred the punishment, of failure recently in the\nleast trifle, and the reckless waste of half my lifetime. There have\nbeen meanwhile, generation after generation, those in the inner\nchambers, the whole mass of whom could not, on any account, be, through\nmy influence, allowed to fall into extinction, in order that I, unfilial\nas I have been, may have the means to screen my own shortcomings.",
        "Hence it is that the thatched shed, with bamboo mat windows, the bed of\ntow and the stove of brick, which are at present my share, are not\nsufficient to deter me from carrying out the fixed purpose of my mind.\nAnd could I, furthermore, confront the morning breeze, the evening moon,\nthe willows by the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, methinks\nthese would moisten to a greater degree my mortal pen with ink; but\nthough I lack culture and erudition, what harm is there, however, in\nemploying fiction and unrecondite language to give utterance to the\nmerits of these characters? And were I also able to induce the inmates\nof the inner chamber to understand and diffuse them, could I besides\nbreak the weariness of even so much as a single moment, or could I open\nthe eyes of my contemporaries, will it not forsooth prove a boon?",
        "This consideration has led to the usage of such names as Chia Yü-ts’un\nand other similar appellations.",
        "More than any in these pages have been employed such words as dreams and\nvisions; but these dreams constitute the main argument of this work, and\ncombine, furthermore, the design of giving a word of warning to my\nreaders.",
        "Reader, can you suggest whence the story begins?",
        "The narration may border on the limits of incoherency and triviality,\nbut it possesses considerable zest. But to begin.",
        "The Empress Nü Wo, (the goddess of works,) in fashioning blocks of\nstones, for the repair of the heavens, prepared, at the Ta Huang Hills\nand Wu Ch’i cave, 36,501 blocks of rough stone, each twelve chang in\nheight, and twenty-four chang square. Of these stones, the Empress Wo\nonly used 36,500; so that one single block remained over and above,\nwithout being turned to any account. This was cast down the Ch’ing Keng\npeak. This stone, strange to say, after having undergone a process of\nrefinement, attained a nature of efficiency, and could, by its innate\npowers, set itself into motion and was able to expand and to contract.",
        "When it became aware that the whole number of blocks had been made use\nof to repair the heavens, that it alone had been destitute of the\nnecessary properties and had been unfit to attain selection, it\nforthwith felt within itself vexation and shame, and day and night, it\ngave way to anguish and sorrow.",
        "One day, while it lamented its lot, it suddenly caught sight, at a great\ndistance, of a Buddhist bonze and of a Taoist priest coming towards that\ndirection. Their appearance was uncommon, their easy manner remarkable.\nWhen they drew near this Ch’ing Keng peak, they sat on the ground to\nrest, and began to converse. But on noticing the block newly-polished\nand brilliantly clear, which had moreover contracted in dimensions, and\nbecome no larger than the pendant of a fan, they were greatly filled\nwith admiration. The Buddhist priest picked it up, and laid it in the\npalm of his hand.",
        "“Your appearance,” he said laughingly, “may well declare you to be a\nsupernatural object, but as you lack any inherent quality it is\nnecessary to inscribe a few characters on you, so that every one who\nshall see you may at once recognise you to be a remarkable thing. And\nsubsequently, when you will be taken into a country where honour and\naffluence will reign, into a family cultured in mind and of official\nstatus, in a land where flowers and trees shall flourish with\nluxuriance, in a town of refinement, renown and glory; when you once\nwill have been there...”",
        "The stone listened with intense delight.",
        "“What characters may I ask,” it consequently inquired, “will you\ninscribe? and what place will I be taken to? pray, pray explain to me in\nlucid terms.” “You mustn’t be inquisitive,” the bonze replied, with a\nsmile, “in days to come you’ll certainly understand everything.” Having\nconcluded these words, he forthwith put the stone in his sleeve, and\nproceeded leisurely on his journey, in company with the Taoist priest.\nWhither, however, he took the stone, is not divulged. Nor can it be\nknown how many centuries and ages elapsed, before a Taoist priest, K’ung\nK’ung by name, passed, during his researches after the eternal reason\nand his quest after immortality, by these Ta Huang Hills, Wu Ch’i cave\nand Ch’ing Keng Peak. Suddenly perceiving a large block of stone, on the\nsurface of which the traces of characters giving, in a connected form,\nthe various incidents of its fate, could be clearly deciphered, K’ung\nK’ung examined them from first to last. They, in fact, explained how\nthat this block of worthless stone had originally been devoid of the\nproperties essential for the repairs to the heavens, how it would be\ntransmuted into human form and introduced by Mang Mang the High Lord,\nand Miao Miao, the Divine, into the world of mortals, and how it would\nbe led over the other bank (across the San Sara). On the surface, the\nrecord of the spot where it would fall, the place of its birth, as well\nas various family trifles and trivial love affairs of young ladies,\nverses, odes, speeches and enigmas was still complete; but the name of\nthe dynasty and the year of the reign were obliterated, and could not be\nascertained.",
        "On the obverse, were also the following enigmatical verses:",
        "  Lacking in virtues meet the azure skies to mend,\n  In vain the mortal world full many a year I wend,\n  Of a former and after life these facts that be,\n  Who will for a tradition strange record for me?",
        "K’ung K’ung, the Taoist, having pondered over these lines for a while,\nbecame aware that this stone had a history of some kind.",
        "“Brother stone,” he forthwith said, addressing the stone, “the concerns\nof past days recorded on you possess, according to your own account, a\nconsiderable amount of interest, and have been for this reason\ninscribed, with the intent of soliciting generations to hand them down\nas remarkable occurrences. But in my own opinion, they lack, in the\nfirst place, any data by means of which to establish the name of the\nEmperor and the year of his reign; and, in the second place, these\nconstitute no record of any excellent policy, adopted by any high\nworthies or high loyal statesmen, in the government of the state, or in\nthe rule of public morals. The contents simply treat of a certain number\nof maidens, of exceptional character; either of their love affairs or\ninfatuations, or of their small deserts or insignificant talents; and\nwere I to transcribe the whole collection of them, they would,\nnevertheless, not be estimated as a book of any exceptional worth.”",
        "“Sir Priest,” the stone replied with assurance, “why are you so\nexcessively dull? The dynasties recorded in the rustic histories, which\nhave been written from age to age, have, I am fain to think, invariably\nassumed, under false pretences, the mere nomenclature of the Han and\nT’ang dynasties. They differ from the events inscribed on my block,\nwhich do not borrow this customary practice, but, being based on my own\nexperiences and natural feelings, present, on the contrary, a novel and\nunique character. Besides, in the pages of these rustic histories,\neither the aspersions upon sovereigns and statesmen, or the strictures\nupon individuals, their wives, and their daughters, or the deeds of\nlicentiousness and violence are too numerous to be computed. Indeed,\nthere is one more kind of loose literature, the wantonness and pollution\nin which work most easy havoc upon youth.",
        "“As regards the works, in which the characters of scholars and beauties\nis delineated their allusions are again repeatedly of Wen Chün, their\ntheme in every page of Tzu Chien; a thousand volumes present no\ndiversity; and a thousand characters are but a counterpart of each\nother. What is more, these works, throughout all their pages, cannot\nhelp bordering on extreme licence. The authors, however, had no other\nobject in view than to give utterance to a few sentimental odes and\nelegant ballads of their own, and for this reason they have fictitiously\ninvented the names and surnames of both men and women, and necessarily\nintroduced, in addition, some low characters, who should, like a buffoon\nin a play, create some excitement in the plot.",
        "“Still more loathsome is a kind of pedantic and profligate literature,\nperfectly devoid of all natural sentiment, full of self-contradictions;\nand, in fact, the contrast to those maidens in my work, whom I have,\nduring half my lifetime, seen with my own eyes and heard with my own\nears. And though I will not presume to estimate them as superior to the\nheroes and heroines in the works of former ages, yet the perusal of the\nmotives and issues of their experiences, may likewise afford matter\nsufficient to banish dulness, and to break the spell of melancholy.",
        "“As regards the several stanzas of doggerel verse, they may too evoke\nsuch laughter as to compel the reader to blurt out the rice, and to\nspurt out the wine.",
        "“In these pages, the scenes depicting the anguish of separation, the\nbliss of reunion, and the fortunes of prosperity and of adversity are\nall, in every detail, true to human nature, and I have not taken upon\nmyself to make the slightest addition, or alteration, which might lead\nto the perversion of the truth.",
        "“My only object has been that men may, after a drinking bout, or after\nthey wake from sleep or when in need of relaxation from the pressure of\nbusiness, take up this light literature, and not only expunge the traces\nof antiquated books, and obtain a new kind of distraction, but that they\nmay also lay by a long life as well as energy and strength; for it bears\nno point of similarity to those works, whose designs are false, whose\ncourse is immoral. Now, Sir Priest, what are your views on the subject?”",
        "K’ung K’ung having pondered for a while over the words, to which he had\nlistened intently, re-perused, throughout, this record of the stone; and\nfinding that the general purport consisted of nought else than a\ntreatise on love, and likewise of an accurate transcription of facts,\nwithout the least taint of profligacy injurious to the times, he\nthereupon copied the contents, from beginning to end, to the intent of\ncharging the world to hand them down as a strange story.",
        "Hence it was that K’ung K’ung, the Taoist, in consequence of his\nperception, (in his state of) abstraction, of passion, the generation,\nfrom this passion, of voluptuousness, the transmission of this\nvoluptuousness into passion, and the apprehension, by means of passion,\nof its unreality, forthwith altered his name for that of “Ch’ing Tseng\"\n(the Voluptuous Bonze), and changed the title of “the Memoir of a Stone\"\n(Shih-t’ou-chi,) for that of “Ch’ing Tseng Lu,” The Record of the\nVoluptuous Bonze; while K’ung Mei-chi of Tung Lu gave it the name of\n\"Feng Yüeh Pao Chien,” “The Precious Mirror of Voluptuousness.” In later\nyears, owing to the devotion by Tsao Hsüeh-ch’in in the Tao Hung study,\nof ten years to the perusal and revision of the work, the additions and\nmodifications effected by him five times, the affix of an index and the\ndivision into periods and chapters, the book was again entitled “Chin\nLing Shih Erh Ch’ai,” “The Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling.” A stanza was\nfurthermore composed for the purpose. This then, and no other, is the\norigin of the Record of the Stone. The poet says appositely:–",
        "  Pages full of silly litter,\n  Tears a handful sour and bitter;\n  All a fool the author hold,\n  But their zest who can unfold?",
        "You have now understood the causes which brought about the Record of the\nStone, but as you are not, as yet, aware what characters are depicted,\nand what circumstances are related on the surface of the block, reader,\nplease lend an ear to the narrative on the stone, which runs as\nfollows:–",
        "In old days, the land in the South East lay low. In this South-East part\nof the world, was situated a walled town, Ku Su by name. Within the\nwalls a locality, called the Ch’ang Men, was more than all others\nthroughout the mortal world, the centre, which held the second, if not\nthe first place for fashion and life. Beyond this Ch’ang Men was a\nstreet called Shih-li-chieh (Ten Li street); in this street a lane,\nthe Jen Ch’ing lane (Humanity and Purity); and in this lane stood an old\ntemple, which on account of its diminutive dimensions, was called, by\ngeneral consent, the Gourd temple. Next door to this temple lived the\nfamily of a district official, Chen by surname, Fei by name, and\nShih-yin by style. His wife, née Feng, possessed a worthy and virtuous\ndisposition, and had a clear perception of moral propriety and good\nconduct. This family, though not in actual possession of excessive\naffluence and honours, was, nevertheless, in their district, conceded to\nbe a clan of well-to-do standing. As this Chen Shih-yin was of a\ncontented and unambitious frame of mind, and entertained no hankering\nafter any official distinction, but day after day of his life took\ndelight in gazing at flowers, planting bamboos, sipping his wine and\nconning poetical works, he was in fact, in the indulgence of these\npursuits, as happy as a supernatural being.",
        "One thing alone marred his happiness. He had lived over half a century\nand had, as yet, no male offspring around his knees. He had one only\nchild, a daughter, whose infant name was Ying Lien. She was just three\nyears of age. On a long summer day, on which the heat had been intense,\nShih-yin sat leisurely in his library. Feeling his hand tired, he\ndropped the book he held, leant his head on a teapoy, and fell asleep.",
        "Of a sudden, while in this state of unconsciousness, it seemed as if he\nhad betaken himself on foot to some spot or other whither he could not\ndiscriminate. Unexpectedly he espied, in the opposite direction, two\npriests coming towards him: the one a Buddhist, the other a Taoist. As\nthey advanced they kept up the conversation in which they were engaged.\n\"Whither do you purpose taking the object you have brought away?” he\nheard the Taoist inquire. To this question the Buddhist replied with a\nsmile: “Set your mind at ease,” he said; “there’s now in maturity a plot\nof a general character involving mundane pleasures, which will presently\ncome to a denouement. The whole number of the votaries of voluptuousness\nhave, as yet, not been quickened or entered the world, and I mean to\navail myself of this occasion to introduce this object among their\nnumber, so as to give it a chance to go through the span of human\nexistence.” “The votaries of voluptuousness of these days will naturally\nhave again to endure the ills of life during their course through the\nmortal world,” the Taoist remarked; “but when, I wonder, will they\nspring into existence? and in what place will they descend?”",
        "“The account of these circumstances,” the bonze ventured to reply, “is\nenough to make you laugh! They amount to this: there existed in the\nwest, on the bank of the Ling (spiritual) river, by the side of the San\nSheng (thrice-born) stone, a blade of the Chiang Chu (purple pearl)\ngrass. At about the same time it was that the block of stone was,\nconsequent upon its rejection by the goddess of works, also left to\nramble and wander to its own gratification, and to roam about at\npleasure to every and any place. One day it came within the precincts of\nthe Ching Huan (Monitory Vision) Fairy; and this Fairy, cognizant of the\nfact that this stone had a history, detained it, therefore, to reside at\nthe Ch’ih Hsia (purple clouds) palace, and apportioned to it the duties\nof attendant on Shen Ying, a fairy of the Ch’ih Hsia palace.",
        "“This stone would, however, often stroll along the banks of the Ling\nriver, and having at the sight of the blade of spiritual grass been\nfilled with admiration, it, day by day, moistened its roots with sweet\ndew. This purple pearl grass, at the outset, tarried for months and\nyears; but being at a later period imbued with the essence and\nluxuriance of heaven and earth, and having incessantly received the\nmoisture and nurture of the sweet dew, divested itself, in course of\ntime, of the form of a grass; assuming, in lieu, a human nature, which\ngradually became perfected into the person of a girl.",
        "“Every day she was wont to wander beyond the confines of the Li Hen\n(divested animosities) heavens. When hungry she fed on the Pi Ch’ing\n(hidden love) fruit–when thirsty she drank the Kuan ch’ou (discharged\nsorrows,) water. Having, however, up to this time, not shewn her\ngratitude for the virtue of nurture lavished upon her, the result was\nbut natural that she should resolve in her heart upon a constant and\nincessant purpose to make suitable acknowledgment.",
        "“I have been,” she would often commune within herself, “the recipient of\nthe gracious bounty of rain and dew, but I possess no such water as was\nlavished upon me to repay it! But should it ever descend into the world\nin the form of a human being, I will also betake myself thither, along\nwith it; and if I can only have the means of making restitution to it,\nwith the tears of a whole lifetime, I may be able to make adequate\nreturn.”",
        "“This resolution it is that will evolve the descent into the world of so\nmany pleasure-bound spirits of retribution and the experience of\nfantastic destinies; and this crimson pearl blade will also be among the\nnumber. The stone still lies in its original place, and why should not\nyou and I take it along before the tribunal of the Monitory Vision\nFairy, and place on its behalf its name on record, so that it should\ndescend into the world, in company with these spirits of passion, and\nbring this plot to an issue?”",
        "“It is indeed ridiculous,” interposed the Taoist. “Never before have I\nheard even the very mention of restitution by means of tears! Why should\nnot you and I avail ourselves of this opportunity to likewise go down\ninto the world? and if successful in effecting the salvation of a few of\nthem, will it not be a work meritorious and virtuous?”",
        "“This proposal,” remarked the Buddhist, “is quite in harmony with my own\nviews. Come along then with me to the palace of the Monitory Vision\nFairy, and let us deliver up this good-for-nothing object, and have done\nwith it! And when the company of pleasure-bound spirits of wrath descend\ninto human existence, you and I can then enter the world. Half of them\nhave already fallen into the dusty universe, but the whole number of\nthem have not, as yet, come together.”",
        "“Such being the case,” the Taoist acquiesced, “I am ready to follow you,\nwhenever you please to go.”",
        "But to return to Chen Shih-yin. Having heard every one of these words\ndistinctly, he could not refrain from forthwith stepping forward and\npaying homage. “My spiritual lords,” he said, as he smiled, “accept my\nobeisance.” The Buddhist and Taoist priests lost no time in responding\nto the compliment, and they exchanged the usual salutations. “My\nspiritual lords,” Shih-yin continued; “I have just heard the\nconversation that passed between you, on causes and effects, a\nconversation the like of which few mortals have forsooth listened to;\nbut your younger brother is sluggish of intellect, and cannot lucidly\nfathom the import! Yet could this dulness and simplicity be graciously\ndispelled, your younger brother may, by listening minutely, with\nundefiled ear and careful attention, to a certain degree be aroused to a\nsense of understanding; and what is more, possibly find the means of\nescaping the anguish of sinking down into Hades.”",
        "The two spirits smiled, “The conversation,” they added, “refers to the\nprimordial scheme and cannot be divulged before the proper season; but,\nwhen the time comes, mind do not forget us two, and you will readily be\nable to escape from the fiery furnace.”",
        "Shih-yin, after this reply, felt it difficult to make any further\ninquiries. “The primordial scheme,” he however remarked smiling,\n\"cannot, of course, be divulged; but what manner of thing, I wonder, is\nthe good-for-nothing object you alluded to a short while back? May I not\nbe allowed to judge for myself?”",
        "“This object about which you ask,” the Buddhist Bonze responded, “is\nintended, I may tell you, by fate to be just glanced at by you.” With\nthese words he produced it, and handed it over to Shih-yin.",
        "Shih-yin received it. On scrutiny he found it, in fact, to be a\nbeautiful gem, so lustrous and so clear that the traces of characters on\nthe surface were distinctly visible. The characters inscribed consisted\nof the four “T’ung Ling Pao Yü,” “Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.\"\nOn the obverse, were also several columns of minute words, which he was\njust in the act of looking at intently, when the Buddhist at once\nexpostulated.",
        "“We have already reached,” he exclaimed, “the confines of vision.\"\nSnatching it violently out of his hands, he walked away with the Taoist,\nunder a lofty stone portal, on the face of which appeared in large type\nthe four characters: “T’ai Hsü Huan Ching,” “The Visionary limits of the\nGreat Void.” On each side was a scroll with the lines:",
        "  When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false,\n  Where naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught.",
        "Shih-yin meant also to follow them on the other side, but, as he was\nabout to make one step forward, he suddenly heard a crash, just as if\nthe mountains had fallen into ruins, and the earth sunk into\ndestruction. As Shih-yin uttered a loud shout, he looked with strained\neye; but all he could see was the fiery sun shining, with glowing rays,\nwhile the banana leaves drooped their heads. By that time, half of the\ncircumstances connected with the dream he had had, had already slipped\nfrom his memory.",
        "He also noticed a nurse coming towards him with Ying Lien in her arms.\nTo Shih-yin’s eyes his daughter appeared even more beautiful, such a\nbright gem, so precious, and so lovable. Forthwith stretching out his\narms, he took her over, and, as he held her in his embrace, he coaxed\nher to play with him for a while; after which he brought her up to the\nstreet to see the great stir occasioned by the procession that was going\npast.",
        "He was about to come in, when he caught sight of two priests, one a\nTaoist, the other a Buddhist, coming hither from the opposite direction.\nThe Buddhist had a head covered with mange, and went barefooted. The\nTaoist had a limping foot, and his hair was all dishevelled.",
        "Like maniacs, they jostled along, chattering and laughing as they drew\nnear.",
        "As soon as they reached Shih-yin’s door, and they perceived him with\nYing Lien in his arms, the Bonze began to weep aloud.",
        "Turning towards Shih-yin, he said to him: “My good Sir, why need you\ncarry in your embrace this living but luckless thing, which will involve\nfather and mother in trouble?”",
        "These words did not escape Shih-yin’s ear; but persuaded that they\namounted to raving talk, he paid no heed whatever to the bonze.",
        "“Part with her and give her to me,” the Buddhist still went on to say.",
        "Shih-yin could not restrain his annoyance; and hastily pressing his\ndaughter closer to him, he was intent upon going in, when the bonze\npointed his hand at him, and burst out in a loud fit of laughter.",
        "He then gave utterance to the four lines that follow:",
        "  You indulge your tender daughter and are laughed at as inane;\n  Vain you face the snow, oh mirror! for it will evanescent wane,\n  When the festival of lanterns is gone by, guard ’gainst your doom,\n  ’Tis what time the flames will kindle, and the fire will consume.",
        "Shih-yin understood distinctly the full import of what he heard; but his\nheart was still full of conjectures. He was about to inquire who and\nwhat they were, when he heard the Taoist remark,–\"You and I cannot\nspeed together; let us now part company, and each of us will be then\nable to go after his own business. After the lapse of three ages, I\nshall be at the Pei Mang mount, waiting for you; and we can, after our\nreunion, betake ourselves to the Visionary Confines of the Great Void,\nthere to cancel the name of the stone from the records.”",
        "“Excellent! first rate!” exclaimed the Bonze. And at the conclusion of\nthese words, the two men parted, each going his own way, and no trace\nwas again seen of them.",
        "“These two men,” Shih-yin then pondered within his heart, “must have had\nmany experiences, and I ought really to have made more inquiries of\nthem; but at this juncture to indulge in regret is anyhow too late.”",
        "While Shih-yin gave way to these foolish reflections, he suddenly\nnoticed the arrival of a penniless scholar, Chia by surname, Hua by\nname, Shih-fei by style and Yü-ts’un by nickname, who had taken up his\nquarters in the Gourd temple next door. This Chia Yü-ts’un was\noriginally a denizen of Hu-Chow, and was also of literary and official\nparentage, but as he was born of the youngest stock, and the possessions\nof his paternal and maternal ancestors were completely exhausted, and\nhis parents and relatives were dead, he remained the sole and only\nsurvivor; and, as he found his residence in his native place of no\navail, he therefore entered the capital in search of that reputation,\nwhich would enable him to put the family estate on a proper standing. He\nhad arrived at this place since the year before last, and had, what is\nmore, lived all along in very straitened circumstances. He had made the\ntemple his temporary quarters, and earned a living by daily occupying\nhimself in composing documents and writing letters for customers. Thus\nit was that Shih-yin had been in constant relations with him.",
        "As soon as Yü-ts’un perceived Shih-yin, he lost no time in saluting him.\n\"My worthy Sir,” he observed with a forced smile; “how is it you are\nleaning against the door and looking out? Is there perchance any news\nastir in the streets, or in the public places?”",
        "“None whatever,” replied Shih-yin, as he returned the smile. “Just a\nwhile back, my young daughter was in sobs, and I coaxed her out here to\namuse her. I am just now without anything whatever to attend to, so\nthat, dear brother Chia, you come just in the nick of time. Please walk\ninto my mean abode, and let us endeavour, in each other’s company, to\nwhile away this long summer day.”",
        "After he had made this remark, he bade a servant take his daughter in,\nwhile he, hand-in-hand with Yü-ts’un, walked into the library, where a\nyoung page served tea. They had hardly exchanged a few sentences, when\none of the household came in, in flying haste, to announce that Mr. Yen\nhad come to pay a visit.",
        "Shih-yin at once stood up. “Pray excuse my rudeness,” he remarked\napologetically, “but do sit down; I shall shortly rejoin you, and enjoy\nthe pleasure of your society.” “My dear Sir,” answered Yü-ts’un, as he\ngot up, also in a conceding way, “suit your own convenience. I’ve often\nhad the honour of being your guest, and what will it matter if I wait a\nlittle?” While these apologies were yet being spoken, Shih-yin had\nalready walked out into the front parlour. During his absence, Yü-ts’un\noccupied himself in turning over the pages of some poetical work to\ndispel ennui, when suddenly he heard, outside the window, a woman’s\ncough. Yü-ts’un hurriedly got up and looked out. He saw at a glance that\nit was a servant girl engaged in picking flowers. Her deportment was out\nof the common; her eyes so bright, her eyebrows so well defined. Though\nnot a perfect beauty, she possessed nevertheless charms sufficient to\narouse the feelings. Yü-ts’un unwittingly gazed at her with fixed eye.\nThis waiting-maid, belonging to the Chen family, had done picking\nflowers, and was on the point of going in, when she of a sudden raised\nher eyes and became aware of the presence of some person inside the\nwindow, whose head-gear consisted of a turban in tatters, while his\nclothes were the worse for wear. But in spite of his poverty, he was\nnaturally endowed with a round waist, a broad back, a fat face, a square\nmouth; added to this, his eyebrows were swordlike, his eyes resembled\nstars, his nose was straight, his cheeks square.",
        "This servant girl turned away in a hurry and made her escape.",
        "“This man so burly and strong,” she communed within herself, “yet at the\nsame time got up in such poor attire, must, I expect, be no one else\nthan the man, whose name is Chia Yü-ts’un or such like, time after time\nreferred to by my master, and to whom he has repeatedly wished to give a\nhelping hand, but has failed to find a favourable opportunity. And as\nrelated to our family there is no connexion or friend in such straits, I\nfeel certain it cannot be any other person than he. Strange to say, my\nmaster has further remarked that this man will, for a certainty, not\nalways continue in such a state of destitution.”",
        "As she indulged in this train of thought, she could not restrain herself\nfrom turning her head round once or twice.",
        "When Yü-ts’un perceived that she had looked back, he readily interpreted\nit as a sign that in her heart her thoughts had been of him, and he was\nfrantic with irrepressible joy.",
        "“This girl,” he mused, “is, no doubt, keen-eyed and eminently shrewd,\nand one in this world who has seen through me.”",
        "The servant youth, after a short time, came into the room; and when\nYü-ts’un made inquiries and found out from him that the guests in the\nfront parlour had been detained to dinner, he could not very well wait\nany longer, and promptly walked away down a side passage and out of a\nback door.",
        "When the guests had taken their leave, Shih-yin did not go back to\nrejoin Yü-ts’un, as he had come to know that he had already left.",
        "In time the mid-autumn festivities drew near; and Shih-yin, after the\nfamily banquet was over, had a separate table laid in the library, and\ncrossed over, in the moonlight, as far as the temple and invited\nYü-ts’un to come round.",
        "The fact is that Yü-ts’un, ever since the day on which he had seen the\ngirl of the Chen family turn twice round to glance at him, flattered\nhimself that she was friendly disposed towards him, and incessantly\nfostered fond thoughts of her in his heart. And on this day, which\nhappened to be the mid-autumn feast, he could not, as he gazed at the\nmoon, refrain from cherishing her remembrance. Hence it was that he gave\nvent to these pentameter verses:",
        "  Alas! not yet divined my lifelong wish,\n  And anguish ceaseless comes upon anguish\n  I came, and sad at heart, my brow I frowned;\n  She went, and oft her head to look turned round.\n  Facing the breeze, her shadow she doth watch,\n  Who’s meet this moonlight night with her to match?\n  The lustrous rays if they my wish but read\n  Would soon alight upon her beauteous head!",
        "Yü-ts’un having, after this recitation, recalled again to mind how that\nthroughout his lifetime his literary attainments had had an adverse fate\nand not met with an opportunity (of reaping distinction), went on to rub\nhis brow, and as he raised his eyes to the skies, he heaved a deep sigh\nand once more intoned a couplet aloud:",
        "  The gem in the cask a high price it seeks,\n  The pin in the case to take wing it waits.",
        "As luck would have it, Shih-yin was at the moment approaching, and upon\nhearing the lines, he said with a smile: “My dear Yü-ts’un, really your\nattainments are of no ordinary capacity.”",
        "Yü-ts’un lost no time in smiling and replying. “It would be presumption\nin my part to think so,” he observed. “I was simply at random humming a\nfew verses composed by former writers, and what reason is there to laud\nme to such an excessive degree? To what, my dear Sir, do I owe the\npleasure of your visit?” he went on to inquire. “Tonight,” replied\nShih-yin, “is the mid-autumn feast, generally known as the full-moon\nfestival; and as I could not help thinking that living, as you my worthy\nbrother are, as a mere stranger in this Buddhist temple, you could not\nbut experience the feeling of loneliness. I have, for the express\npurpose, prepared a small entertainment, and will be pleased if you will\ncome to my mean abode to have a glass of wine. But I wonder whether you\nwill entertain favourably my modest invitation?” Yü-ts’un, after\nlistening to the proposal, put forward no refusal of any sort; but\nremarked complacently: “Being the recipient of such marked attention,\nhow can I presume to repel your generous consideration?”",
        "As he gave expression to these words, he walked off there and then, in\ncompany with Shih-yin, and came over once again into the court in front\nof the library. In a few minutes, tea was over.",
        "The cups and dishes had been laid from an early hour, and needless to\nsay the wines were luscious; the fare sumptuous.",
        "The two friends took their seats. At first they leisurely replenished\ntheir glasses, and quietly sipped their wine; but as, little by little,\nthey entered into conversation, their good cheer grew more genial, and\nunawares the glasses began to fly round, and the cups to be exchanged.",
        "At this very hour, in every house of the neighbourhood, sounded the fife\nand lute, while the inmates indulged in music and singing. Above head,\nthe orb of the radiant moon shone with an all-pervading splendour, and\nwith a steady lustrous light, while the two friends, as their exuberance\nincreased, drained their cups dry so soon as they reached their lips.",
        "Yü-ts’un, at this stage of the collation, was considerably under the\ninfluence of wine, and the vehemence of his high spirits was\nirrepressible. As he gazed at the moon, he fostered thoughts, to which\nhe gave vent by the recital of a double couplet.",
        "  ’Tis what time three meets five, Selene is a globe!\n  Her pure rays fill the court, the jadelike rails enrobe!\n  Lo! in the heavens her disk to view doth now arise,\n  And in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes.",
        "“Excellent!” cried Shih-yin with a loud voice, after he had heard these\nlines; “I have repeatedly maintained that it was impossible for you to\nremain long inferior to any, and now the verses you have recited are a\nprognostic of your rapid advancement. Already it is evident that, before\nlong, you will extend your footsteps far above the clouds! I must\ncongratulate you! I must congratulate you! Let me, with my own hands,\npour a glass of wine to pay you my compliments.”",
        "Yü-ts’un drained the cup. “What I am about to say,” he explained as he\nsuddenly heaved a sigh, “is not the maudlin talk of a man under the\neffects of wine. As far as the subjects at present set in the\nexaminations go, I could, perchance, also have well been able to enter\nthe list, and to send in my name as a candidate; but I have, just now,\nno means whatever to make provision for luggage and for travelling\nexpenses. The distance too to Shen Ching is a long one, and I could not\ndepend upon the sale of papers or the composition of essays to find the\nmeans of getting there.”",
        "Shih-yin gave him no time to conclude. “Why did you not speak about this\nsooner?” he interposed with haste. “I have long entertained this\nsuspicion; but as, whenever I met you, this conversation was never\nbroached, I did not presume to make myself officious. But if such be the\nstate of affairs just now, I lack, I admit, literary qualification, but\non the two subjects of friendly spirit and pecuniary means, I have,\nnevertheless, some experience. Moreover, I rejoice that next year is\njust the season for the triennial examinations, and you should start for\nthe capital with all despatch; and in the tripos next spring, you will,\nby carrying the prize, be able to do justice to the proficiency you can\nboast of. As regards the travelling expenses and the other items, the\nprovision of everything necessary for you by my own self will again not\nrender nugatory your mean acquaintance with me.”",
        "Forthwith, he directed a servant lad to go and pack up at once fifty\ntaels of pure silver and two suits of winter clothes.",
        "“The nineteenth,” he continued, “is a propitious day, and you should\nlose no time in hiring a boat and starting on your journey westwards.\nAnd when, by your eminent talents, you shall have soared high to a lofty\nposition, and we meet again next winter, will not the occasion be\nextremely felicitous?”",
        "Yü-ts’un accepted the money and clothes with but scanty expression of\ngratitude. In fact, he paid no thought whatever to the gifts, but went\non, again drinking his wine, as he chattered and laughed.",
        "It was only when the third watch of that day had already struck that the\ntwo friends parted company; and Shih-yin, after seeing Yü-ts’un off,\nretired to his room and slept, with one sleep all through, never waking\nuntil the sun was well up in the skies.",
        "Remembering the occurrence of the previous night, he meant to write a\ncouple of letters of recommendation for Yü-ts’un to take along with him\nto the capital, to enable him, after handing them over at the mansions\nof certain officials, to find some place as a temporary home. He\naccordingly despatched a servant to ask him to come round, but the man\nreturned and reported that from what the bonze said, “Mr. Chia had\nstarted on his journey to the capital, at the fifth watch of that very\nmorning, that he had also left a message with the bonze to deliver to\nyou, Sir, to the effect that men of letters paid no heed to lucky or\nunlucky days, that the sole consideration with them was the nature of\nthe matter in hand, and that he could find no time to come round in\nperson and bid good-bye.”",
        "Shih-yin after hearing this message had no alternative but to banish the\nsubject from his thoughts.",
        "In comfortable circumstances, time indeed goes by with easy stride. Soon\ndrew near also the happy festival of the 15th of the 1st moon, and\nShih-yin told a servant Huo Ch’i to take Ying Lien to see the\nsacrificial fires and flowery lanterns.",
        "About the middle of the night, Huo Ch’i was hard pressed, and he\nforthwith set Ying Lien down on the doorstep of a certain house. When he\nfelt relieved, he came back to take her up, but failed to find anywhere\nany trace of Ying Lien. In a terrible plight, Huo Ch’i prosecuted his\nsearch throughout half the night; but even by the dawn of day, he had\nnot discovered any clue of her whereabouts. Huo Ch’i, lacking, on the\nother hand, the courage to go back and face his master, promptly made\nhis escape to his native village.",
        "Shih-yin–in fact, the husband as well as the wife–seeing that their\nchild had not come home during the whole night, readily concluded that\nsome mishap must have befallen her. Hastily they despatched several\nservants to go in search of her, but one and all returned to report that\nthere was neither vestige nor tidings of her.",
        "This couple had only had this child, and this at the meridian of their\nlife, so that her sudden disappearance plunged them in such great\ndistress that day and night they mourned her loss to such a point as to\nwell nigh pay no heed to their very lives.",
        "A month in no time went by. Shih-yin was the first to fall ill, and his\nwife, Dame Feng, likewise, by dint of fretting for her daughter, was\nalso prostrated with sickness. The doctor was, day after day, sent for,\nand the oracle consulted by means of divination.",
        "Little did any one think that on this day, being the 15th of the 3rd\nmoon, while the sacrificial oblations were being prepared in the Hu Lu\ntemple, a pan with oil would have caught fire, through the want of care\non the part of the bonze, and that in a short time the flames would have\nconsumed the paper pasted on the windows.",
        "Among the natives of this district bamboo fences and wooden partitions\nwere in general use, and these too proved a source of calamity so\nordained by fate (to consummate this decree).",
        "With promptness (the fire) extended to two buildings, then enveloped\nthree, then dragged four (into ruin), and then spread to five houses,\nuntil the whole street was in a blaze, resembling the flames of a\nvolcano. Though both the military and the people at once ran to the\nrescue, the fire had already assumed a serious hold, so that it was\nimpossible for them to afford any effective assistance for its\nsuppression.",
        "It blazed away straight through the night, before it was extinguished,\nand consumed, there is in fact no saying how many dwelling houses.\nAnyhow, pitiful to relate, the Chen house, situated as it was next door\nto the temple, was, at an early part of the evening, reduced to a heap\nof tiles and bricks; and nothing but the lives of that couple and\nseveral inmates of the family did not sustain any injuries.",
        "Shih-yin was in despair, but all he could do was to stamp his feet and\nheave deep sighs. After consulting with his wife, they betook themselves\nto a farm of theirs, where they took up their quarters temporarily. But\nas it happened that water had of late years been scarce, and no crops\nbeen reaped, robbers and thieves had sprung up like bees, and though the\nGovernment troops were bent upon their capture, it was anyhow difficult\nto settle down quietly on the farm. He therefore had no other resource\nthan to convert, at a loss, the whole of his property into money, and to\ntake his wife and two servant girls and come over for shelter to the\nhouse of his father-in-law.",
        "His father-in-law, Feng Su, by name, was a native of Ta Ju Chou.\nAlthough only a labourer, he was nevertheless in easy circumstances at\nhome. When he on this occasion saw his son-in-law come to him in such\ndistress, he forthwith felt at heart considerable displeasure.\nFortunately Shih-yin had still in his possession the money derived from\nthe unprofitable realization of his property, so that he produced and\nhanded it to his father-in-law, commissioning him to purchase, whenever\na suitable opportunity presented itself, a house and land as a provision\nfor food and raiment against days to come. This Feng Su, however, only\nexpended the half of the sum, and pocketed the other half, merely\nacquiring for him some fallow land and a dilapidated house.",
        "Shih-yin being, on the other hand, a man of books and with no experience\nin matters connected with business and with sowing and reaping,\nsubsisted, by hook and by crook, for about a year or two, when he became\nmore impoverished.",
        "In his presence, Feng Su would readily give vent to specious utterances,\nwhile, with others, and behind his back, he on the contrary expressed\nhis indignation against his improvidence in his mode of living, and\nagainst his sole delight of eating and playing the lazy.",
        "Shih-yin, aware of the want of harmony with his father-in-law, could not\nhelp giving way, in his own heart, to feelings of regret and pain. In\naddition to this, the fright and vexation which he had undergone the\nyear before, the anguish and suffering (he had had to endure), had\nalready worked havoc (on his constitution); and being a man advanced in\nyears, and assailed by the joint attack of poverty and disease, he at\nlength gradually began to display symptoms of decline.",
        "Strange coincidence, as he, on this day, came leaning on his staff and\nwith considerable strain, as far as the street for a little relaxation,\nhe suddenly caught sight, approaching from the off side, of a Taoist\npriest with a crippled foot; his maniac appearance so repulsive, his\nshoes of straw, his dress all in tatters, muttering several sentiments\nto this effect:",
        "  All men spiritual life know to be good,\n  But fame to disregard they ne’er succeed!\n  From old till now the statesmen where are they?\n  Waste lie their graves, a heap of grass, extinct.\n  All men spiritual life know to be good,\n  But to forget gold, silver, ill succeed!\n  Through life they grudge their hoardings to be scant,\n  And when plenty has come, their eyelids close.\n  All men spiritual life hold to be good,\n  Yet to forget wives, maids, they ne’er succeed!\n  Who speak of grateful love while lives their lord,\n  And dead their lord, another they pursue.\n  All men spiritual life know to be good,\n  But sons and grandsons to forget never succeed!\n  From old till now of parents soft many,\n  But filial sons and grandsons who have seen?",
        "Shih-yin upon hearing these words, hastily came up to the priest, “What\nwere you so glibly holding forth?” he inquired. “All I could hear were a\nlot of hao liao (excellent, finality.”)",
        "“You may well have heard the two words ’hao liao,’” answered the Taoist\nwith a smile, “but can you be said to have fathomed their meaning? You\nshould know that all things in this world are excellent, when they have\nattained finality; when they have attained finality, they are excellent;\nbut when they have not attained finality, they are not excellent; if\nthey would be excellent, they should attain finality. My song is\nentitled Excellent-finality (hao liao).”",
        "Shih-yin was gifted with a natural perspicacity that enabled him, as\nsoon as he heard these remarks, to grasp their spirit.",
        "“Wait a while,” he therefore said smilingly; “let me unravel this\nexcellent-finality song of yours; do you mind?”",
        "“Please by all means go on with the interpretation,” urged the Taoist;\nwhereupon Shih-yin proceeded in this strain:",
        "  Sordid rooms and vacant courts,\n  Replete in years gone by with beds where statesmen lay;\n  Parched grass and withered banian trees,\n  Where once were halls for song and dance!\n  Spiders’ webs the carved pillars intertwine,\n  The green gauze now is also pasted on the straw windows!\n  What about the cosmetic fresh concocted or the powder just scented;\n  Why has the hair too on each temple become white like hoarfrost!\n  Yesterday the tumulus of yellow earth buried the bleached bones,\n  To-night under the red silk curtain reclines the couple!\n  Gold fills the coffers, silver fills the boxes,\n  But in a twinkle, the beggars will all abuse you!\n  While you deplore that the life of others is not long,\n  You forget that you yourself are approaching death!\n  You educate your sons with all propriety,\n  But they may some day, ’tis hard to say become thieves;\n  Though you choose (your fare and home) the fatted beam,\n  You may, who can say, fall into some place of easy virtue!\n  Through your dislike of the gauze hat as mean,\n  You have come to be locked in a cangue;\n  Yesterday, poor fellow, you felt cold in a tattered coat,\n  To-day, you despise the purple embroidered dress as long!\n  Confusion reigns far and wide! you have just sung your part, I come on\n      the boards,\n  Instead of yours, you recognise another as your native land;\n  What utter perversion!\n  In one word, it comes to this we make wedding clothes for others!\n  (We sow for others to reap.)",
        "The crazy limping Taoist clapped his hands. “Your interpretation is\nexplicit,” he remarked with a hearty laugh, “your interpretation is\nexplicit!”",
        "Shih-yin promptly said nothing more than,–\"Walk on;” and seizing the\nstole from the Taoist’s shoulder, he flung it over his own. He did not,\nhowever, return home, but leisurely walked away, in company with the\neccentric priest.",
        "The report of his disappearance was at once bruited abroad, and plunged\nthe whole neighbourhood in commotion; and converted into a piece of\nnews, it was circulated from mouth to mouth.",
        "Dame Feng, Shih-yin’s wife, upon hearing the tidings, had such a fit of\nweeping that she hung between life and death; but her only alternative\nwas to consult with her father, and to despatch servants on all sides to\ninstitute inquiries. No news was however received of him, and she had\nnothing else to do but to practise resignation, and to remain dependent\nupon the support of her parents for her subsistence. She had fortunately\nstill by her side, to wait upon her, two servant girls, who had been\nwith her in days gone by; and the three of them, mistress as well as\nservants, occupied themselves day and night with needlework, to assist\nher father in his daily expenses.",
        "This Feng Su had after all, in spite of his daily murmurings against his\nbad luck, no help but to submit to the inevitable.",
        "On a certain day, the elder servant girl of the Chen family was at the\ndoor purchasing thread, and while there, she of a sudden heard in the\nstreet shouts of runners clearing the way, and every one explain that\nthe new magistrate had come to take up his office.",
        "The girl, as she peeped out from inside the door, perceived the lictors\nand policemen go by two by two; and when unexpectedly in a state chair,\nwas carried past an official, in black hat and red coat, she was indeed\nquite taken aback.",
        "“The face of this officer would seem familiar,” she argued within\nherself; “just as if I had seen him somewhere or other ere this.”",
        "Shortly she entered the house, and banishing at once the occurrence from\nher mind, she did not give it a second thought. At night, however, while\nshe was waiting to go to bed, she suddenly heard a sound like a rap at\nthe door. A band of men boisterously cried out: “We are messengers,\ndeputed by the worthy magistrate of this district, and come to summon\none of you to an enquiry.”",
        "Feng Su, upon hearing these words, fell into such a terrible\nconsternation that his eyes stared wide and his mouth gaped.",
        "What calamity was impending is not as yet ascertained, but, reader,\nlisten to the explanation contained in the next chapter.",
        "  The spirit of Mrs. Chia Shih-yin departs from the town of Yang Chou.\n  Leng Tzu-hsing dilates upon the Jung Kuo Mansion.",
        "To continue. Feng Su, upon hearing the shouts of the public messengers,\ncame out in a flurry and forcing a smile, he asked them to explain\n(their errand); but all these people did was to continue bawling out:\n\"Be quick, and ask Mr. Chen to come out.”",
        "“My surname is Feng,” said Feng Su, as he promptly forced himself to\nsmile; “It is’nt Chen at all: I had once a son-in-law whose surname was\nChen, but he has left home, it is now already a year or two back. Is it\nperchance about him that you are inquiring?”",
        "To which the public servants remarked: “We know nothing about Chen or\nChia (true or false); but as he is your son-in-law, we’ll take you at\nonce along with us to make verbal answer to our master and have done\nwith it.”",
        "And forthwith the whole bevy of public servants hustled Feng Su on, as\nthey went on their way back; while every one in the Feng family was\nseized with consternation, and could not imagine what it was all about.",
        "It was no earlier than the second watch, when Feng Su returned home; and\nthey, one and all, pressed him with questions as to what had happened.",
        "“The fact is,” he explained, “the newly-appointed Magistrate, whose\nsurname is Chia, whose name is Huo and who is a native of Hu-chow, has\nbeen on intimate terms, in years gone by, with our son-in-law; that at\nthe sight of the girl Chiao Hsing, standing at the door, in the act of\nbuying thread, he concluded that he must have shifted his quarters over\nhere, and hence it was that his messengers came to fetch him. I gave him\na clear account of the various circumstances (of his misfortunes), and\nthe Magistrate was for a time much distressed and expressed his regret.\nHe then went on to make inquiries about my grand-daughter, and I\nexplained that she had been lost, while looking at the illuminations.\n’No matter,’ put in the Magistrate, ’I will by and by order my men to\nmake search, and I feel certain that they will find her and bring her\nback.’ Then ensued a short conversation, after which I was about to go,\nwhen he presented me with the sum of two taels.”",
        "The mistress of the Chen family (Mrs. Chen Shih-yin) could not but feel\nvery much affected by what she heard, and the whole evening she uttered\nnot a word.",
        "The next day, at an early hour, Yü-ts’un sent some of his men to bring\nover to Chen’s wife presents, consisting of two packets of silver, and\nfour pieces of brocaded silk, as a token of gratitude, and to Feng Su\nalso a confidential letter, requesting him to ask of Mrs. Chen her maid\nChiao Hsing to become his second wife.",
        "Feng Su was so intensely delighted that his eyebrows expanded, his eyes\nsmiled, and he felt eager to toady to the Magistrate (by presenting the\ngirl to him). He hastened to employ all his persuasive powers with his\ndaughter (to further his purpose), and on the same evening he forthwith\nescorted Chiao Hsing in a small chair to the Yamên.",
        "The joy experienced by Yü-ts’un need not be dilated upon. He also\npresented Feng Su with a packet containing one hundred ounces of gold;\nand sent numerous valuable presents to Mrs. Chen, enjoining her “to live\ncheerfully in the anticipation of finding out the whereabouts of her\ndaughter.”",
        "It must be explained, however, that the maid Chi’ao Hsing was the very\nperson, who, a few years ago, had looked round at Yü-ts’un and who, by\none simple, unpremeditated glance, evolved, in fact, this extraordinary\ndestiny which was indeed an event beyond conception.",
        "Who would ever have foreseen that fate and fortune would both have so\nfavoured her that she should, contrary to all anticipation, give birth\nto a son, after living with Yü-ts’un barely a year, that in addition to\nthis, after the lapse of another half year, Yü-ts’un’s wife should have\ncontracted a sudden illness and departed this life, and that Yü-ts’un\nshould have at once raised her to the rank of first wife. Her destiny is\nadequately expressed by the lines:",
        "  Through but one single, casual look\n  Soon an exalted place she took.",
        "The fact is that after Yü-ts’un had been presented with the money by\nShih-yin, he promptly started on the 16th day for the capital, and at\nthe triennial great tripos, his wishes were gratified to the full.\nHaving successfully carried off his degree of graduate of the third\nrank, his name was put by selection on the list for provincial\nappointments. By this time, he had been raised to the rank of Magistrate\nin this district; but, in spite of the excellence and sufficiency of his\naccomplishments and abilities, he could not escape being ambitious and\noverbearing. He failed besides, confident as he was in his own merits,\nin respect toward his superiors, with the result that these officials\nlooked upon him scornfully with the corner of the eye.",
        "A year had hardly elapsed, when he was readily denounced in a memorial\nto the Throne by the High Provincial authorities, who represented that\nhe was of a haughty disposition, that he had taken upon himself to\nintroduce innovations in the rites and ceremonies, that overtly, while\nhe endeavoured to enjoy the reputation of probity and uprightness, he,\nsecretly, combined the nature of the tiger and wolf; with the\nconsequence that he had been the cause of much trouble in the district,\nand that he had made life intolerable for the people, &c. &c.",
        "The Dragon countenance of the Emperor was considerably incensed. His\nMajesty lost no time in issuing commands, in reply to the Memorial, that\nhe should be deprived of his official status.",
        "On the arrival of the despatch from the Board, great was the joy felt by\nevery officer, without exception, of the prefecture in which he had held\noffice. Yü-ts’un, though at heart intensely mortified and incensed,\nbetrayed not the least outward symptom of annoyance, but still\npreserved, as of old, a smiling and cheerful countenance.",
        "He handed over charge of all official business and removed the savings\nwhich he had accumulated during the several years he had been in office,\nhis family and all his chattels to his original home; where, after\nhaving put everything in proper order, he himself travelled (carried the\nwinds and sleeved the moon) far and wide, visiting every relic of note\nin the whole Empire.",
        "As luck would have it, on a certain day while making a second journey\nthrough the Wei Yang district, he heard the news that the Salt\nCommissioner appointed this year was Lin Ju-hai. This Lin Ju-hai’s\nfamily name was Lin, his name Hai and his style Ju-hai. He had obtained\nthe third place in the previous triennial examination, and had, by this\ntime, already risen to the rank of Director of the Court of Censors. He\nwas a native of Kú Su. He had been recently named by Imperial\nappointment a Censor attached to the Salt Inspectorate, and had arrived\nat his post only a short while back.",
        "In fact, the ancestors of Lin Ju-hai had, from years back, successively\ninherited the title of Marquis, which rank, by its present descent to\nJu-hai, had already been enjoyed by five generations. When first\nconferred, the hereditary right to the title had been limited to three\ngenerations; but of late years, by an act of magnanimous favour and\ngenerous beneficence, extraordinary bounty had been superadded; and on\nthe arrival of the succession to the father of Ju-hai, the right had\nbeen extended to another degree. It had now descended to Ju-hai, who\nhad, besides this title of nobility, begun his career as a successful\ngraduate. But though his family had been through uninterrupted ages the\nrecipient of imperial bounties, his kindred had all been anyhow men of\nculture.",
        "The only misfortune had been that the several branches of the Lin family\nhad not been prolific, so that the numbers of its members continued\nlimited; and though there existed several households, they were all\nhowever to Ju-hai no closer relatives than first cousins. Neither were\nthere any connections of the same lineage, or of the same parentage.",
        "Ju-hai was at this date past forty; and had only had a son, who had died\nthe previous year, in the third year of his age. Though he had several\nhandmaids, he had not had the good fortune of having another son; but\nthis was too a matter that could not be remedied.",
        "By his wife, née Chia, he had a daughter, to whom the infant name of Tai\nYü was given. She was, at this time, in her fifth year. Upon her the\nparents doated as much as if she were a brilliant pearl in the palm of\ntheir hand. Seeing that she was endowed with natural gifts of\nintelligence and good looks, they also felt solicitous to bestow upon\nher a certain knowledge of books, with no other purpose than that of\nsatisfying, by this illusory way, their wishes of having a son to\nnurture and of dispelling the anguish felt by them, on account of the\ndesolation and void in their family circle (round their knees).",
        "But to proceed. Yü-ts’un, while sojourning at an inn, was unexpectedly\nlaid up with a violent chill. Finding on his recovery, that his funds\nwere not sufficient to pay his expenses, he was thinking of looking out\nfor some house where he could find a resting place when he suddenly came\nacross two friends acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner. Knowing\nthat this official was desirous to find a tutor to instruct his\ndaughter, they lost no time in recommending Yü-ts’un, who moved into the\nYamên.",
        "His female pupil was youthful in years and delicate in physique, so that\nher lessons were irregular. Besides herself, there were only two waiting\ngirls, who remained in attendance during the hours of study, so that\nYü-ts’un was spared considerable trouble and had a suitable opportunity\nto attend to the improvement of his health.",
        "In a twinkle, another year and more slipped by, and when least expected,\nthe mother of his ward, née Chia, was carried away after a short\nillness. His pupil (during her mother’s sickness) was dutiful in her\nattendance, and prepared the medicines for her use. (And after her\ndeath,) she went into the deepest mourning prescribed by the rites, and\ngave way to such excess of grief that, naturally delicate as she was,\nher old complaint, on this account, broke out anew.",
        "Being unable for a considerable time to prosecute her studies, Yü-ts’un\nlived at leisure and had no duties to attend to. Whenever therefore the\nwind was genial and the sun mild, he was wont to stroll at random, after\nhe had done with his meals.",
        "On this particular day, he, by some accident, extended his walk beyond\nthe suburbs, and desirous to contemplate the nature of the rustic\nscenery, he, with listless step, came up to a spot encircled by hills\nand streaming pools, by luxuriant clumps of trees and thick groves of\nbamboos. Nestling in the dense foliage stood a temple. The doors and\ncourts were in ruins. The walls, inner and outer, in disrepair. An\ninscription on a tablet testified that this was the temple of Spiritual\nPerception. On the sides of the door was also a pair of old and\ndilapidated scrolls with the following enigmatical verses.",
        "  Behind ample there is, yet to retract the hand, the mind heeds not,\n      until.\n  Before the mortal vision lies no path, when comes to turn the will.",
        "“These two sentences,” Yü-ts’un pondered after perusal, “although simple\nin language, are profound in signification. I have previous to this\nvisited many a spacious temple, located on hills of note, but never have\nI beheld an inscription referring to anything of the kind. The meaning\ncontained in these words must, I feel certain, owe their origin to the\nexperiences of some person or other; but there’s no saying. But why\nshould I not go in and inquire for myself?”",
        "Upon walking in, he at a glance caught sight of no one else, but of a\nvery aged bonze, of unkempt appearance, cooking his rice. When Yü-ts’un\nperceived that he paid no notice, he went up to him and asked him one or\ntwo questions, but as the old priest was dull of hearing and a dotard,\nand as he had lost his teeth, and his tongue was blunt, he made most\nirrelevant replies.",
        "Yü-ts’un lost all patience with him, and withdrew again from the\ncompound with the intention of going as far as the village public house\nto have a drink or two, so as to enhance the enjoyment of the rustic\nscenery. With easy stride, he accordingly walked up to the place.\nScarcely had he passed the threshold of the public house, when he\nperceived some one or other among the visitors who had been sitting\nsipping their wine on the divan, jump up and come up to greet him, with\na face beaming with laughter.",
        "“What a strange meeting! What a strange meeting!” he exclaimed aloud.",
        "Yü-ts’un speedily looked at him, (and remembered) that this person had,\nin past days, carried on business in a curio establishment in the\ncapital, and that his surname was Leng and his style Tzu-hsing.",
        "A mutual friendship had existed between them during their sojourn, in\ndays of yore, in the capital; and as Yü-ts’un had entertained the\nhighest opinion of Leng Tzu-hsing, as being a man of action and of great\nabilities, while this Leng Tzu-hsing, on the other hand, borrowed of the\nreputation of refinement enjoyed by Yü-ts’un, the two had consequently\nall along lived in perfect harmony and companionship.",
        "“When did you get here?” Yü-ts’un eagerly inquired also smilingly. “I\nwasn’t in the least aware of your arrival. This unexpected meeting is\npositively a strange piece of good fortune.”",
        "“I went home,” Tzu-hsing replied, “about the close of last year, but now\nas I am again bound to the capital, I passed through here on my way to\nlook up a friend of mine and talk some matters over. He had the kindness\nto press me to stay with him for a couple of days longer, and as I after\nall have no urgent business to attend to, I am tarrying a few days, but\npurpose starting about the middle of the moon. My friend is busy to-day,\nso I roamed listlessly as far as here, never dreaming of such a\nfortunate meeting.”",
        "While speaking, he made Yü-ts’un sit down at the same table, and ordered\na fresh supply of wine and eatables; and as the two friends chatted of\none thing and another, they slowly sipped their wine.",
        "The conversation ran on what had occurred after the separation, and\nYü-ts’un inquired, “Is there any news of any kind in the capital?”",
        "“There’s nothing new whatever,” answered Tzu-hsing. “There is one thing\nhowever: in the family of one of your worthy kinsmen, of the same name\nas yourself, a trifling, but yet remarkable, occurrence has taken\nplace.”",
        "“None of my kindred reside in the capital,” rejoined Yü-ts’un with a\nsmile. “To what can you be alluding?”",
        "“How can it be that you people who have the same surname do not belong\nto one clan?” remarked Tzu-hsing, sarcastically.",
        "“In whose family?” inquired Yü-ts’un.",
        "“The Chia family,” replied Tzu-hsing smiling, “whose quarters are in the\nJung Kuo Mansion, does not after all reflect discredit upon the lintel\nof your door, my venerable friend.”",
        "“What!” exclaimed Yü-ts’un, “did this affair take place in that family?\nWere we to begin reckoning, we would find the members of my clan to be\nanything but limited in number. Since the time of our ancestor Chia Fu,\nwho lived while the Eastern Han dynasty occupied the Throne, the\nbranches of our family have been numerous and flourishing; they are now\nto be found in every single province, and who could, with any accuracy,\nascertain their whereabouts? As regards the Jung-kuo branch in\nparticular, their names are in fact inscribed on the same register as\nour own, but rich and exalted as they are, we have never presumed to\nclaim them as our relatives, so that we have become more and more\nestranged.”",
        "“Don’t make any such assertions,” Tzu-hsing remarked with a sigh, “the\npresent two mansions of Jung and Ning have both alike also suffered\nreverses, and they cannot come up to their state of days of yore.”",
        "“Up to this day, these two households of Ning and of Jung,” Yü-ts’un\nsuggested, “still maintain a very large retinue of people, and how can\nit be that they have met with reverses?”",
        "“To explain this would be indeed a long story,” said Leng Tzu-hsing.\n\"Last year,” continued Yü-ts’un, “I arrived at Chin Ling, as I\nentertained a wish to visit the remains of interest of the six\ndynasties, and as I on that day entered the walled town of Shih T’ou, I\npassed by the entrance of that old residence. On the east side of the\nstreet, stood the Ning Kuo mansion; on the west the Jung Kuo mansion;\nand these two, adjoining each other as they do, cover in fact well-nigh\nhalf of the whole length of the street. Outside the front gate\neverything was, it is true, lonely and deserted; but at a glance into\nthe interior over the enclosing wall, I perceived that the halls,\npavilions, two-storied structures and porches presented still a majestic\nand lofty appearance. Even the flower garden, which extends over the\nwhole area of the back grounds, with its trees and rockeries, also\npossessed to that day an air of luxuriance and freshness, which betrayed\nno signs of a ruined or decrepid establishment.”",
        "“You have had the good fortune of starting in life as a graduate,\"\nexplained Tzu-tsing as he smiled, “and yet are not aware of the saying\nuttered by some one of old: that a centipede even when dead does not lie\nstiff. (These families) may, according to your version, not be up to the\nprosperity of former years, but, compared with the family of an ordinary\nofficial, their condition anyhow presents a difference. Of late the\nnumber of the inmates has, day by day, been on the increase; their\naffairs have become daily more numerous; of masters and servants, high\nand low, who live in ease and respectability very many there are; but of\nthose who exercise any forethought, or make any provision, there is not\neven one. In their daily wants, their extravagances, and their\nexpenditure, they are also unable to adapt themselves to circumstances\nand practise economy; (so that though) the present external framework\nmay not have suffered any considerable collapse, their purses have\nanyhow begun to feel an exhausting process! But this is a mere trifle.\nThere is another more serious matter. Would any one ever believe that in\nsuch families of official status, in a clan of education and culture,\nthe sons and grandsons of the present age would after all be each\n(succeeding) generation below the standard of the former?”",
        "Yü-ts’un, having listened to these remarks, observed: “How ever can it\nbe possible that families of such education and refinement can observe\nany system of training and nurture which is not excellent? Concerning\nthe other branches, I am not in a position to say anything; but\nrestricting myself to the two mansions of Jung and Ning, they are those\nin which, above all others, the education of their children is\nmethodical.”",
        "“I was just now alluding to none other than these two establishments,\"\nTzu-hsing observed with a sigh; “but let me tell you all. In days of\nyore, the duke of Ning Kuo and the duke of Jung Kuo were two uterine\nbrothers. The Ning duke was the elder; he had four sons. After the death\nof the duke of Ning Kuo, his eldest son, Chia Tai-hua, came into the\ntitle. He also had two sons; but the eldest, whose name was Hu, died at\nthe age of eight or nine; and the only survivor, the second son, Chia\nChing, inherited the title. His whole mind is at this time set upon\nTaoist doctrines; his sole delight is to burn the pill and refine the\ndual powers; while every other thought finds no place in his mind.\nHappily, he had, at an early age, left a son, Chia Chen, behind in the\nlay world, and his father, engrossed as his whole heart was with the\nidea of attaining spiritual life, ceded the succession of the official\ntitle to him. His parent is, besides, not willing to return to the\noriginal family seat, but lives outside the walls of the capital,\nfoolishly hobnobbing with all the Taoist priests. This Mr. Chen had also\na son, Chia Jung, who is, at this period, just in his sixteenth year.\nMr. Ching gives at present no attention to anything at all, so that Mr.\nChen naturally devotes no time to his studies, but being bent upon\nnought else but incessant high pleasure, he has subversed the order of\nthings in the Ning Kuo mansion, and yet no one can summon the courage to\ncome and hold him in check. But I’ll now tell you about the Jung mansion\nfor your edification. The strange occurrence, to which I alluded just\nnow, came about in this manner. After the demise of the Jung duke, the\neldest son, Chia Tai-shan, inherited the rank. He took to himself as\nwife, the daughter of Marquis Shih, a noble family of Chin Ling, by whom\nhe had two sons; the elder being Chia She, the younger Chia Cheng. This\nTai Shan is now dead long ago; but his wife is still alive, and the\nelder son, Chia She, succeeded to the degree. He is a man of amiable and\ngenial disposition, but he likewise gives no thought to the direction of\nany domestic concern. The second son Chia Cheng displayed, from his\nearly childhood, a great liking for books, and grew up to be correct and\nupright in character. His grandfather doated upon him, and would have\nhad him start in life through the arena of public examinations, but,\nwhen least expected, Tai-shan, being on the point of death, bequeathed a\npetition, which was laid before the Emperor. His Majesty, out of regard\nfor his former minister, issued immediate commands that the elder son\nshould inherit the estate, and further inquired how many sons there were\nbesides him, all of whom he at once expressed a wish to be introduced in\nhis imperial presence. His Majesty, moreover, displayed exceptional\nfavour, and conferred upon Mr. Cheng the brevet rank of second class\nAssistant Secretary (of a Board), and commanded him to enter the Board\nto acquire the necessary experience. He has already now been promoted to\nthe office of second class Secretary. This Mr. Cheng’s wife, nèe Wang,\nfirst gave birth to a son called Chia Chu, who became a Licentiate in\nhis fourteenth year. At barely twenty, he married, but fell ill and died\nsoon after the birth of a son. Her (Mrs. Cheng’s) second child was a\ndaughter, who came into the world, by a strange coincidence, on the\nfirst day of the year. She had an unexpected (pleasure) in the birth,\nthe succeeding year, of another son, who, still more remarkable to say,\nhad, at the time of his birth, a piece of variegated and crystal-like\nbrilliant jade in his mouth, on which were yet visible the outlines of\nseveral characters. Now, tell me, was not this a novel and strange\noccurrence? eh?”",
        "“Strange indeed!” exclaimed Yü-ts’un with a smile; “but I presume the\ncoming experiences of this being will not be mean.”",
        "Tzu-hsing gave a faint smile. “One and all,” he remarked, “entertain the\nsame idea. Hence it is that his mother doats upon him like upon a\nprecious jewel. On the day of his first birthday, Mr. Cheng readily\nentertained a wish to put the bent of his inclinations to the test, and\nplaced before the child all kinds of things, without number, for him to\ngrasp from. Contrary to every expectation, he scorned every other\nobject, and, stretching forth his hand, he simply took hold of rouge,\npowder and a few hair-pins, with which he began to play. Mr. Cheng\nexperienced at once displeasure, as he maintained that this youth would,\nby and bye, grow up into a sybarite, devoted to wine and women, and for\nthis reason it is, that he soon began to feel not much attachment for\nhim. But his grandmother is the one who, in spite of everything, prizes\nhim like the breath of her own life. The very mention of what happened\nis even strange! He is now grown up to be seven or eight years old, and,\nalthough exceptionally wilful, in intelligence and precocity, however,\nnot one in a hundred could come up to him! And as for the utterances of\nthis child, they are no less remarkable. The bones and flesh of woman,\nhe argues, are made of water, while those of man of mud. ’Women to my\neyes are pure and pleasing,’ he says, ’while at the sight of man, I\nreadily feel how corrupt, foul and repelling they are!’ Now tell me, are\nnot these words ridiculous? There can be no doubt whatever that he will\nby and bye turn out to be a licentious roué.”",
        "Yü-ts’un, whose countenance suddenly assumed a stern air, promptly\ninterrupted the conversation. “It doesn’t quite follow,” he suggested.\n\"You people don’t, I regret to say, understand the destiny of this\nchild. The fact is that even the old Hanlin scholar Mr. Cheng was\nerroneously looked upon as a loose rake and dissolute debauchee! But\nunless a person, through much study of books and knowledge of letters,\nso increases (in lore) as to attain the talent of discerning the nature\nof things, and the vigour of mind to fathom the Taoist reason as well as\nto comprehend the first principle, he is not in a position to form any\njudgment.”",
        "Tzu-hsing upon perceiving the weighty import of what he propounded,\n\"Please explain,” he asked hastily, “the drift (of your argument).” To\nwhich Yü-ts’un responded: “Of the human beings created by the operation\nof heaven and earth, if we exclude those who are gifted with extreme\nbenevolence and extreme viciousness, the rest, for the most part,\npresent no striking diversity. If they be extremely benevolent, they\nfall in, at the time of their birth, with an era of propitious fortune;\nwhile those extremely vicious correspond, at the time of their\nexistence, with an era of calamity. When those who coexist with\npropitious fortune come into life, the world is in order; when those who\ncoexist with unpropitious fortune come into life, the world is in\ndanger. Yao, Shun, Yü, Ch’eng T’ang, Wen Wang, Wu Wang, Chou Kung, Chao\nKung, Confucius, Mencius, T’ung Hu, Han Hsin, Chou Tzu, Ch’eng Tzu, Chu\nTzu and Chang Tzu were ordained to see light in an auspicious era.\nWhereas Ch’i Yu, Kung Kung, Chieh Wang, Chou Wang, Shih Huang, Wang\nMang, Tsao Ts’ao, Wen Wen, An Hu-shan, Ch’in Kuei and others were one\nand all destined to come into the world during a calamitous age. Those\nendowed with extreme benevolence set the world in order; those possessed\nof extreme maliciousness turn the world into disorder. Purity,\nintelligence, spirituality and subtlety constitute the vital spirit of\nright which pervades heaven and earth, and the persons gifted with\nbenevolence are its natural fruit. Malignity and perversity constitute\nthe spirit of evil, which permeates heaven and earth, and malicious\npersons are affected by its influence. The days of perpetual happiness\nand eminent good fortune, and the era of perfect peace and tranquility,\nwhich now prevail, are the offspring of the pure, intelligent, divine\nand subtle spirit which ascends above, to the very Emperor, and below\nreaches the rustic and uncultured classes. Every one is without\nexception under its influence. The superfluity of the subtle spirit\nexpands far and wide, and finding nowhere to betake itself to, becomes,\nin due course, transformed into dew, or gentle breeze; and, by a process\nof diffusion, it pervades the whole world.",
        "“The spirit of malignity and perversity, unable to expand under the\nbrilliant sky and transmuting sun, eventually coagulates, pervades and\nstops up the deep gutters and extensive caverns; and when of a sudden\nthe wind agitates it or it be impelled by the clouds, and any slight\ndisposition, on its part, supervenes to set itself in motion, or to\nbreak its bounds, and so little as even the minutest fraction does\nunexpectedly find an outlet, and happens to come across any spirit of\nperception and subtlety which may be at the time passing by, the spirit\nof right does not yield to the spirit of evil, and the spirit of evil is\nagain envious of the spirit of right, so that the two do not harmonize.\nJust like wind, water, thunder and lightning, which, when they meet in\nthe bowels of the earth, must necessarily, as they are both to dissolve\nand are likewise unable to yield, clash and explode to the end that they\nmay at length exhaust themselves. Hence it is that these spirits have\nalso forcibly to diffuse themselves into the human race to find an\noutlet, so that they may then completely disperse, with the result that\nmen and women are suddenly imbued with these spirits and spring into\nexistence. At best, (these human beings) cannot be generated into\nphilanthropists or perfect men; at worst, they cannot also embody\nextreme perversity or extreme wickedness. Yet placed among one million\nbeings, the spirit of intelligence, refinement, perception and subtlety\nwill be above these one million beings; while, on the other hand, the\nperverse, depraved and inhuman embodiment will likewise be below the\nmillion of men. Born in a noble and wealthy family, these men will be a\nsalacious, lustful lot; born of literary, virtuous or poor parentage,\nthey will turn out retired scholars or men of mark; though they may by\nsome accident be born in a destitute and poverty-stricken home, they\ncannot possibly, in fact, ever sink so low as to become runners or\nmenials, or contentedly brook to be of the common herd or to be driven\nand curbed like a horse in harness. They will become, for a certainty,\neither actors of note or courtesans of notoriety; as instanced in former\nyears by Hsü Yu, T’ao Ch’ien, Yuan Chi, Chi Kang, Liu Ling, the two\nfamilies of Wang and Hsieh, Ku Hu-t’ou, Ch’en Hou-chu, T’ang Ming-huang,\nSung Hui-tsung, Liu T’ing-chih, Wen Fei-ching, Mei Nan-kung, Shih\nMan-ch’ing, Lui C’hih-ch’ing and Chin Shao-yu, and exemplified\nnow-a-days by Ni Yün-lin, T’ang Po-hu, Chu Chih-shan, and also by Li\nKuei-men, Huang P’an-cho, Ching Hsin-mo, Cho Wen-chün; and the women\nHung Fu, Hsieh T’ao, Ch’ü Ying, Ch’ao Yün and others; all of whom were\nand are of the same stamp, though placed in different scenes of action.”",
        "“From what you say,” observed Tzu-hsing, “success makes (a man) a duke\nor a marquis; ruin, a thief!”",
        "“Quite so; that’s just my idea!” replied Yü-ts’un; “I’ve not as yet let\nyou know that after my degradation from office, I spent the last couple\nof years in travelling for pleasure all over each province, and that I\nalso myself came across two extraordinary youths. This is why, when a\nshort while back you alluded to this Pao-yü, I at once conjectured, with\na good deal of certainty, that he must be a human being of the same\nstamp. There’s no need for me to speak of any farther than the walled\ncity of Chin Ling. This Mr. Chen was, by imperial appointment, named\nPrincipal of the Government Public College of the Chin Ling province. Do\nyou perhaps know him?”",
        "“Who doesn’t know him?” remarked Tzu-hsing. “This Chen family is an old\nconnection of the Chia family. These two families were on terms of great\nintimacy, and I myself likewise enjoyed the pleasure of their friendship\nfor many a day.”",
        "“Last year, when at Chin Ling,” Yü-ts’un continued with a smile, “some\none recommended me as resident tutor to the school in the Chen mansion;\nand when I moved into it I saw for myself the state of things. Who would\never think that that household was grand and luxurious to such a degree!\nBut they are an affluent family, and withal full of propriety, so that a\nschool like this was of course not one easy to obtain. The pupil,\nhowever, was, it is true, a young tyro, but far more troublesome to\nteach than a candidate for the examination of graduate of the second\ndegree. Were I to enter into details, you would indeed have a laugh. ’I\nmust needs,’ he explained, ’have the company of two girls in my studies\nto enable me to read at all, and to keep likewise my brain clear.\nOtherwise, if left to myself, my head gets all in a muddle.’ Time after\ntime, he further expounded to his young attendants, how extremely\nhonourable and extremely pure were the two words representing woman,\nthat they are more valuable and precious than the auspicious animal, the\nfelicitous bird, rare flowers and uncommon plants. ’You may not’ (he was\nwont to say), ’on any account heedlessly utter them, you set of foul\nmouths and filthy tongues! these two words are of the utmost import!\nWhenever you have occasion to allude to them, you must, before you can\ndo so with impunity, take pure water and scented tea and rinse your\nmouths. In the event of any slip of the tongue, I shall at once have\nyour teeth extracted, and your eyes gouged out.’ His obstinacy and\nwaywardness are, in every respect, out of the common. After he was\nallowed to leave school, and to return home, he became, at the sight of\nthe young ladies, so tractable, gentle, sharp, and polite, transformed,\nin fact, like one of them. And though, for this reason, his father has\npunished him on more than one occasion, by giving him a sound thrashing,\nsuch as brought him to the verge of death, he cannot however change.\nWhenever he was being beaten, and could no more endure the pain, he was\nwont to promptly break forth in promiscuous loud shouts, ’Girls! girls!’\nThe young ladies, who heard him from the inner chambers, subsequently\nmade fun of him. ’Why,’ they said, ’when you are being thrashed, and you\nare in pain, your only thought is to bawl out girls! Is it perchance\nthat you expect us young ladies to go and intercede for you? How is that\nyou have no sense of shame?’ To their taunts he gave a most plausible\nexplanation. ’Once,’ he replied, ’when in the agony of pain, I gave vent\nto shouting girls, in the hope, perchance, I did not then know, of its\nbeing able to alleviate the soreness. After I had, with this purpose,\ngiven one cry, I really felt the pain considerably better; and now that\nI have obtained this secret spell, I have recourse, at once, when I am\nin the height of anguish, to shouts of girls, one shout after another.\nNow what do you say to this? Isn’t this absurd, eh?”",
        "“The grandmother is so infatuated by her extreme tenderness for this\nyouth, that, time after time, she has, on her grandson’s account, found\nfault with the tutor, and called her son to task, with the result that I\nresigned my post and took my leave. A youth, with a disposition such as\nhis, cannot assuredly either perpetuate intact the estate of his father\nand grandfather, or follow the injunctions of teacher or advice of\nfriends. The pity is, however, that there are, in that family, several\nexcellent female cousins, the like of all of whom it would be difficult\nto discover.”",
        "“Quite so!” remarked Tzu-hsing; “there are now three young ladies in the\nChia family who are simply perfection itself. The eldest is a daughter\nof Mr. Cheng, Yuan Ch’un by name, who, on account of her excellence,\nfilial piety, talents, and virtue, has been selected as a governess in\nthe palace. The second is the daughter of Mr. She’s handmaid, and is\ncalled Ying Ch’un; the third is T’an Ch’un, the child of Mr. Cheng’s\nhandmaid; while the fourth is the uterine sister of Mr. Chen of the Ning\nMansion. Her name is Hsi Ch’un. As dowager lady Shih is so fondly\nattached to her granddaughters, they come, for the most part, over to\r\r\ntheir grandmother’s place to prosecute their studies together, and each\none of these girls is, I hear, without a fault.”",
        "“More admirable,” observed Yü-ts’un, “is the régime (adhered to) in the\nChen family, where the names of the female children have all been\nselected from the list of male names, and are unlike all those\nout-of-the-way names, such as Spring Blossom, Scented Gem, and the like\nflowery terms in vogue in other families. But how is it that the Chia\nfamily have likewise fallen into this common practice?”",
        "“Not so!” ventured Tzu-h’sing. “It is simply because the eldest daughter\nwas born on the first of the first moon, that the name of Yuan Ch’un was\ngiven to her; while with the rest this character Ch’un (spring) was then\nfollowed. The names of the senior generation are, in like manner,\nadopted from those of their brothers; and there is at present an\ninstance in support of this. The wife of your present worthy master, Mr.\nLin, is the uterine sister of Mr. Chia. She and Mr. Chia Cheng, and she\nwent, while at home, under the name of Chia Min. Should you question the\ntruth of what I say, you are at liberty, on your return, to make minute\ninquiries and you’ll be convinced.”",
        "Yü-ts’un clapped his hands and said smiling, “It’s so, I know! for this\nfemale pupil of mine, whose name is Tai-yü, invariably pronounces the\ncharacter min as mi, whenever she comes across it in the\ncourse of her reading; while, in writing, when she comes to the\ncharacter ’min,’ she likewise reduces the strokes by one, sometimes by\ntwo. Often have I speculated in my mind (as to the cause), but the\nremarks I’ve heard you mention, convince me, without doubt, that it is\nno other reason (than that of reverence to her mother’s name). Strange\nenough, this pupil of mine is unique in her speech and deportment, and\nin no way like any ordinary young lady. But considering that her mother\nwas no commonplace woman herself, it is natural that she should have\ngiven birth to such a child. Besides, knowing, as I do now, that she is\nthe granddaughter of the Jung family, it is no matter of surprise to me\nthat she is what she is. Poor girl, her mother, after all, died in the\ncourse of the last month.”",
        "Tzu-hsing heaved a sigh. “Of three elderly sisters,” he explained, “this\none was the youngest, and she too is gone! Of the sisters of the senior\ngeneration not one even survives! But now we’ll see what the husbands of\nthis younger generation will be like by and bye!”",
        "“Yes,” replied Yü-ts’un. “But some while back you mentioned that Mr.\nCheng has had a son, born with a piece of jade in his mouth, and that he\nhas besides a tender-aged grandson left by his eldest son; but is it\nlikely that this Mr. She has not, himself, as yet, had any male issue?”",
        "“After Mr. Cheng had this son with the jade,” Tzu-hsing added, “his\nhandmaid gave birth to another son, who whether he be good or bad, I\ndon’t at all know. At all events, he has by his side two sons and a\ngrandson, but what these will grow up to be by and bye, I cannot tell.\nAs regards Mr. Chia She, he too has had two sons; the second of whom,\nChia Lien, is by this time about twenty. He took to wife a relative of\nhis, a niece of Mr. Cheng’s wife, a Miss Wang, and has now been married\nfor the last two years. This Mr. Lien has lately obtained by purchase\nthe rank of sub-prefect. He too takes little pleasure in books, but as\nfar as worldly affairs go, he is so versatile and glib of tongue, that\nhe has recently taken up his quarters with his uncle Mr. Cheng, to whom\nhe gives a helping hand in the management of domestic matters. Who would\nhave thought it, however, ever since his marriage with his worthy wife,\nnot a single person, whether high or low, has there been who has not\nlooked up to her with regard: with the result that Mr. Lien himself has,\nin fact, had to take a back seat (_lit. withdrew 35 li). In looks,\nshe is also so extremely beautiful, in speech so extremely quick and\nfluent, in ingenuity so deep and astute, that even a man could, in no\nway, come up to her mark.”",
        "After hearing these remarks Yü-ts’un smiled. “You now perceive,” he\nsaid, “that my argument is no fallacy, and that the several persons\nabout whom you and I have just been talking are, we may presume, human\nbeings, who, one and all, have been generated by the spirit of right,\nand the spirit of evil, and come to life by the same royal road; but of\ncourse there’s no saying.”",
        "“Enough,” cried Tzu-hsing, “of right and enough of evil; we’ve been\ndoing nothing but settling other people’s accounts; come now, have\nanother glass, and you’ll be the better for it!”",
        "“While bent upon talking,” Yü-ts’un explained, “I’ve had more glasses\nthan is good for me.”",
        "“Speaking of irrelevant matters about other people,” Tzu-hsing rejoined\ncomplacently, “is quite the thing to help us swallow our wine; so come\nnow; what harm will happen, if we do have a few glasses more.”",
        "Yü-ts’un thereupon looked out of the window.",
        "“The day is also far advanced,” he remarked, “and if we don’t take care,\nthe gates will be closing; let us leisurely enter the city, and as we go\nalong, there will be nothing to prevent us from continuing our chat.”",
        "Forthwith the two friends rose from their seats, settled and paid their\nwine bill, and were just going, when they unexpectedly heard some one\nfrom behind say with a loud voice:",
        "“Accept my congratulations, Brother Yü-ts’un; I’ve now come, with the\nexpress purpose of giving you the welcome news!”",
        "Yü-ts’un lost no time in turning his head round to look at the speaker.\nBut reader, if you wish to learn who the man was, listen to the details\ngiven in the following chapter.",
        "  Lin Ju-hai appeals to his brother-in-law, Chia Cheng, recommending\n      Yü-ts’un, his daughter’s tutor, to his consideration.\n  Dowager lady Chia sends to fetch her granddaughter, out of\n      commiseration for her being a motherless child.",
        "But to proceed with our narrative.",
        "Yü-ts’un, on speedily turning round, perceived that the speaker was no\nother than a certain Chang Ju-kuei, an old colleague of his, who had\nbeen denounced and deprived of office, on account of some case or other;\na native of that district, who had, since his degradation, resided in\nhis family home.",
        "Having lately come to hear the news that a memorial, presented in the\ncapital, that the former officers (who had been cashiered) should be\nreinstated, had received the imperial consent, he had promptly done all\nhe could, in every nook and corner, to obtain influence, and to find the\nmeans (of righting his position,) when he, unexpectedly, came across\nYü-ts’un, to whom he therefore lost no time in offering his\ncongratulations. The two friends exchanged the conventional salutations,\nand Chang Ju-kuei forthwith communicated the tidings to Yü-ts’un.",
        "Yü-ts’un was delighted, but after he had made a few remarks, in a great\nhurry, each took his leave and sped on his own way homewards.",
        "Leng Tzu-hsing, upon hearing this conversation, hastened at once to\npropose a plan, advising Yü-ts’un to request Lin Ju-hai, in his turn, to\nappeal in the capital to Mr. Chia Cheng for support.",
        "Yü-ts’un accepted the suggestion, and parted from his companion.",
        "On his return to his quarters, he made all haste to lay his hand on the\nMetropolitan Gazette, and having ascertained that the news was\nauthentic, he had on the next day a personal consultation with Ju-hai.",
        "“Providence and good fortune are both alike propitious!” exclaimed\nJu-hai. “After the death of my wife, my mother-in-law, whose residence\nis in the capital, was so very solicitous on my daughter’s account, for\nhaving no one to depend upon, that she despatched, at an early period,\nboats with men and women servants to come and fetch her. But my child\nwas at the time not quite over her illness, and that is why she has not\nyet started. I was, this very moment, cogitating to send my daughter to\nthe capital. And in view of the obligation, under which I am to you for\nthe instruction you have heretofore conferred upon her, remaining as yet\nunrequited, there is no reason why, when such an opportunity as this\npresents itself, I should not do my utmost to find means to make proper\nacknowledgment. I have already, in anticipation, given the matter my\nattention, and written a letter of recommendation to my brother-in-law,\nurging him to put everything right for you, in order that I may, to a\ncertain extent, be able to give effect to my modest wishes. As for any\noutlay that may prove necessary, I have given proper explanation, in the\nletter to my brother-in-law, so that you, my brother, need not trouble\nyourself by giving way to much anxiety.”",
        "As Yü-ts’un bowed and expressed his appreciation in most profuse\nlanguage,–",
        "“Pray,” he asked, “where does your honoured brother-in-law reside? and\nwhat is his official capacity? But I fear I’m too coarse in my manner,\nand could not presume to obtrude myself in his presence.”",
        "Ju-hai smiled. “And yet,” he remarked, “this brother-in-law of mine is\nafter all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is the\ngrandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited the\nstatus of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his style\nNgen-hou. My second brother-in-law’s name is Cheng, his style is\nTzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in the\nBoard of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of the\nhabits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kind\nof men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on your\nbehalf. Were he different to what he really is, not only would he cast a\nslur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewise\nwould not have been as prompt in taking action.”",
        "When Yü-ts’un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had been\ntold him by Tzu-hsing the day before, and he lost no time in again\nexpressing his sense of gratitude to Lin Ju-hai.",
        "Ju-hai resumed the conversation.",
        "“I have fixed,” (he explained,) “upon the second of next month, for my\nyoung daughter’s departure for the capital, and, if you, brother mine,\nwere to travel along with her, would it not be an advantage to herself,\nas well as to yourself?”",
        "Yü-ts’un signified his acquiescence as he listened to his proposal;\nfeeling in his inner self extremely elated.",
        "Ju-hai availed himself of the earliest opportunity to get ready the\npresents (for the capital) and all the requirements for the journey,\nwhich (when completed,) Yü-ts’un took over one by one. His pupil could\nnot, at first, brook the idea, of a separation from her father, but the\npressing wishes of her grandmother left her no course (but to comply).",
        "“Your father,” Ju-hai furthermore argued with her, “is already fifty;\nand I entertain no wish to marry again; and then you are always ailing;\nbesides, with your extreme youth, you have, above, no mother of your own\nto take care of you, and below, no sisters to attend to you. If you now\ngo and have your maternal grandmother, as well as your mother’s brothers\nand your cousins to depend upon, you will be doing the best thing to\nreduce the anxiety which I feel in my heart on your behalf. Why then\nshould you not go?”",
        "Tai-yü, after listening to what her father had to say, parted from him\r\r\nin a flood of tears and followed her nurse and several old matrons from\nthe Jung mansion on board her boat, and set out on her journey.",
        "Yü-ts’un had a boat to himself, and with two youths to wait on him, he\nprosecuted his voyage in the wake of Tai-yü.",
        "By a certain day, they reached Ching Tu; and Yü-ts’un, after first\nadjusting his hat and clothes, came, attended by a youth, to the door of\nthe Jung mansion, and sent in a card, which showed his lineage.",
        "Chia Cheng had, by this time, perused his brother-in-law’s letter, and\nhe speedily asked him to walk in. When they met, he found in Yü-ts’un an\nimposing manner and polite address.",
        "This Chia Cheng had, in fact, a great penchant above all things for men\nof education, men courteous to the talented, respectful to the learned,\nready to lend a helping hand to the needy and to succour the distressed,\nand was, to a great extent, like his grandfather. As it was besides a\nwish intimated by his brother-in-law, he therefore treated Yü-ts’un with\na consideration still more unusual, and readily strained all his\nresources to assist him.",
        "On the very day on which the memorial was submitted to the Throne, he\nobtained by his efforts, a reinstatement to office, and before the\nexpiry of two months, Yü-t’sun was forthwith selected to fill the\nappointment of prefect of Ying T’ien in Chin Ling. Taking leave of Chia\nCheng, he chose a propitious day, and proceeded to his post, where we\nwill leave him without further notice for the present.",
        "But to return to Tai-yü. On the day on which she left the boat, and the\nmoment she put her foot on shore, there were forthwith at her disposal\nchairs for her own use, and carts for the luggage, sent over from the\nJung mansion.",
        "Lin Tai-yü had often heard her mother recount how different was her\ngrandmother’s house from that of other people’s; and having seen for\nherself how above the common run were already the attendants of the\nthree grades, (sent to wait upon her,) in attire, in their fare, in all\ntheir articles of use, “how much more,” (she thought to herself) “now\nthat I am going to her home, must I be careful at every step, and\ncircumspect at every moment! Nor must I utter one word too many, nor\nmake one step more than is proper, for fear lest I should be ridiculed\nby any of them!”",
        "From the moment she got into the chair, and they had entered within the\ncity walls, she found, as she looked around, through the gauze window,\nat the bustle in the streets and public places and at the immense\nconcourse of people, everything naturally so unlike what she had seen\nelsewhere.",
        "After they had also been a considerable time on the way, she suddenly\ncaught sight, at the northern end of the street, of two huge squatting\nlions of marble and of three lofty gates with (knockers representing)\nthe heads of animals. In front of these gates, sat, in a row, about ten\nmen in coloured hats and fine attire. The main gate was not open. It was\nonly through the side gates, on the east and west, that people went in\nand came out. Above the centre gate was a tablet. On this tablet were\ninscribed in five large characters–\"The Ning Kuo mansion erected by\nimperial command.”",
        "“This must be grandmother’s eldest son’s residence,” reflected Tai-yü.",
        "Towards the east, again, at no great distance, were three more high\ngateways, likewise of the same kind as those she had just seen. This was\nthe Jung Kuo mansion.",
        "They did not however go in by the main gate; but simply made their\nentrance through the east side door.",
        "With the sedans on their shoulders, (the bearers) proceeded about the\ndistance of the throw of an arrow, when upon turning a corner, they\nhastily put down the chairs. The matrons, who came behind, one and all\nalso dismounted. (The bearers) were changed for four youths of seventeen\nor eighteen, with hats and clothes without a blemish, and while they\ncarried the chair, the whole bevy of matrons followed on foot.",
        "When they reached a creeper-laden gate, the sedan was put down, and all\nthe youths stepped back and retired. The matrons came forward, raised\nthe screen, and supported Tai-yü to descend from the chair.",
        "Lin Tai-yü entered the door with the creepers, resting on the hand of a\nmatron.",
        "On both sides was a verandah, like two outstretched arms. An Entrance\nHall stood in the centre, in the middle of which was a door-screen of Ta\nLi marble, set in an ebony frame. On the other side of this screen were\nthree very small halls. At the back of these came at once an extensive\ncourtyard, belonging to the main building.",
        "In the front part were five parlours, the frieze of the ceiling of which\nwas all carved, and the pillars ornamented. On either side, were covered\navenues, resembling passages through a rock. In the side-rooms were\nsuspended cages, full of parrots of every colour, thrushes, and birds of\nevery description.",
        "On the terrace-steps, sat several waiting maids, dressed in red and\ngreen, and the whole company of them advanced, with beaming faces, to\ngreet them, when they saw the party approach. “Her venerable ladyship,\"\nthey said, “was at this very moment thinking of you, miss, and, by a\nstrange coincidence, here you are.”",
        "Three or four of them forthwith vied with each other in raising the door\ncurtain, while at the same time was heard some one announce: “Miss Lin\nhas arrived.”",
        "No sooner had she entered the room, than she espied two servants\nsupporting a venerable lady, with silver-white hair, coming forward to\ngreet her. Convinced that this lady must be her grandmother, she was\nabout to prostrate herself and pay her obeisance, when she was quickly\nclasped in the arms of her grandmother, who held her close against her\nbosom; and as she called her “my liver! my flesh!” (my love! my\ndarling!) she began to sob aloud.",
        "The bystanders too, at once, without one exception, melted into tears;\nand Tai-yü herself found some difficulty in restraining her sobs. Little\nby little the whole party succeeded in consoling her, and Tai-yü at\nlength paid her obeisance to her grandmother. Her ladyship thereupon\npointed them out one by one to Tai-yü. “This,” she said, “is the wife of\nyour uncle, your mother’s elder brother; this is the wife of your uncle,\nher second brother; and this is your eldest sister-in-law Chu, the wife\nof your senior cousin Chu.”",
        "Tai-yü bowed to each one of them (with folded arms).",
        "“Ask the young ladies in,” dowager lady Chia went on to say; “tell them\na guest from afar has just arrived, one who comes for the first time;\nand that they may not go to their lessons.”",
        "The servants with one voice signified their obedience, and two of them\nspeedily went to carry out her orders.",
        "Not long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seen\nushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figure\nand of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like a\nfresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious,\ndemure, and lovable to look at.",
        "The second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender was\nshe in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes so\nbeautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze a\nbewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant manners\nall idea of vulgarity was forgotten.",
        "The third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet,\nchildlike.",
        "In their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the three\nyoung ladies was identical.",
        "Tai-yü speedily rose to greet them and to exchange salutations. After\nthey had made each other’s acquaintance, they all took a seat, whereupon\nthe servants brought the tea. Their conversation was confined to\nTai-yü’s mother,–how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her,\nwhat medicines had been given her, and how she had been buried and\nmourned; and dowager lady Chia was naturally again in great anguish.",
        "“Of all my daughters,” she remarked, “your mother was the one I loved\nbest, and now in a twinkle, she has passed away, before me too, and I’ve\nnot been able to so much as see her face. How can this not make my heart\nsore-stricken?”",
        "And as she gave vent to these feelings, she took Tai-yü’s hand in hers,\nand again gave way to sobs; and it was only after the members of the\nfamily had quickly made use of much exhortation and coaxing, that they\nsucceeded, little by little, in stopping her tears.",
        "They all perceived that Tai-yü, despite her youthful years and\nappearance, was lady-like in her deportment and address, and that though\nwith her delicate figure and countenance, (she seemed as if) unable to\nbear the very weight of her clothes, she possessed, however, a certain\ncaptivating air. And as they readily noticed the symptoms of a weak\nconstitution, they went on in consequence to make inquiries as to what\nmedicines she ordinarily took, and how it was that her complaint had not\nbeen cured.",
        "“I have,” explained Tai-yü, “been in this state ever since I was born;\nthough I’ve taken medicines from the very time I was able to eat rice,\nup to the present, and have been treated by ever so many doctors of\nnote, I’ve not derived any benefit. In the year when I was yet only\nthree, I remember a mangy-headed bonze coming to our house, and saying\nthat he would take me along, and make a nun of me; but my father and\nmother would, on no account, give their consent. ’As you cannot bear to\npart from her and to give her up,’ he then remarked, ’her ailment will,\nI fear, never, throughout her life, be cured. If you wish to see her all\nright, it is only to be done by not letting her, from this day forward,\non any account, listen to the sound of weeping, or see, with the\nexception of her parents, any relatives outside the family circle. Then\nalone will she be able to go through this existence in peace and in\nquiet.’ No one heeded the nonsensical talk of this raving priest; but\nhere am I, up to this very day, dosing myself with ginseng pills as a\ntonic.”",
        "“What a lucky coincidence!” interposed dowager lady Chia; “some of these\npills are being compounded here, and I’ll simply tell them to have an\nextra supply made; that’s all.”",
        "Hardly had she finished these words, when a sound of laughter was heard\nfrom the back courtyard. “Here I am too late!” the voice said, “and not\nin time to receive the distant visitor!”",
        "“Every one of all these people,” reflected Tai-yü, “holds her peace and\nsuppresses the very breath of her mouth; and who, I wonder, is this\ncoming in this reckless and rude manner?”",
        "While, as yet, preoccupied with these thoughts, she caught sight of a\ncrowd of married women and waiting-maids enter from the back room,\npressing round a regular beauty.",
        "The attire of this person bore no similarity to that of the young\nladies. In all her splendour and lustre, she looked like a fairy or a\ngoddess. In her coiffure, she had a band of gold filigree work,\nrepresenting the eight precious things, inlaid with pearls; and wore\npins, at the head of each of which were five phoenixes in a rampant\nposition, with pendants of pearls. On her neck, she had a reddish gold\nnecklet, like coiled dragons, with a fringe of tassels. On her person,\nshe wore a tight-sleeved jacket, of dark red flowered satin, covered\nwith hundreds of butterflies, embroidered in gold, interspersed with\nflowers. Over all, she had a variegated stiff-silk pelisse, lined with\nslate-blue ermine; while her nether garments consisted of a jupe of\nkingfisher-colour foreign crepe, brocaded with flowers.",
        "She had a pair of eyes, triangular in shape like those of the red\nphoenix, two eyebrows, curved upwards at each temple, like willow\nleaves. Her stature was elegant; her figure graceful; her powdered face\nlike dawning spring, majestic, yet not haughty. Her carnation lips, long\nbefore they parted, betrayed a smile.",
        "Tai-yü eagerly rose and greeted her.",
        "Old lady Chia then smiled. “You don’t know her,” she observed. “This is\na cunning vixen, who has made quite a name in this establishment! In\nNanking, she went by the appellation of vixen, and if you simply call\nher Feng Vixen, it will do.”",
        "Tai-yü was just at a loss how to address her, when all her cousins\ninformed Tai-yü, that this was her sister-in-law Lien.",
        "Tai-yü had not, it is true, made her acquaintance before, but she had\nheard her mother mention that her eldest maternal uncle Chia She’s son,\nChia Lien, had married the niece of Madame Wang, her second brother’s\nwife, a girl who had, from her infancy, purposely been nurtured to\nsupply the place of a son, and to whom the school name of Wang Hsi-feng\nhad been given.",
        "Tai-yü lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with all\npropriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law. This Hsi-feng laid hold\nof Tai-yü’s hand, and minutely scrutinised her, for a while, from head\nto foot; after which she led her back next to dowager lady Chia, where\nthey both took a seat.",
        "“If really there be a being of such beauty in the world,” she\nconsequently observed with a smile, “I may well consider as having set\neyes upon it to-day! Besides, in the air of her whole person, she\ndoesn’t in fact look like your granddaughter-in-law, our worthy\nancestor, but in every way like your ladyship’s own kindred-\ngranddaughter! It’s no wonder then that your venerable ladyship\nshould have, day after day, had her unforgotten, even for a second, in\nyour lips and heart. It’s a pity, however, that this cousin of mine\nshould have such a hard lot! How did it happen that our aunt died at\nsuch an early period?”",
        "As she uttered these words, she hastily took her handkerchief and wiped\nthe tears from her eyes.",
        "“I’ve only just recovered from a fit of crying,” dowager lady Chia\nobserved, as she smiled, “and have you again come to start me? Your\ncousin has only now arrived from a distant journey, and she is so\ndelicate to boot! Besides, we have a few minutes back succeeded in\ncoaxing her to restrain her sobs, so drop at once making any allusion to\nyour former remarks!”",
        "This Hsi-feng, upon hearing these words, lost no time in converting her\nsorrow into joy.",
        "“Quite right,” she remarked. “But at the sight of my cousin, my whole\nheart was absorbed in her, and I felt happy, and yet wounded at heart:\nbut having disregarded my venerable ancestor’s presence, I deserve to be\nbeaten, I do indeed!”",
        "And hastily taking once more Tai-yü’s hand in her own: “How old are you,\ncousin?” she inquired; “Have you been to school? What medicines are you\ntaking? while you live here, you mustn’t feel homesick; and if there’s\nanything you would like to eat, or to play with, mind you come and tell\nme! or should the waiting maids or the matrons fail in their duties,\ndon’t forget also to report them to me.”",
        "Addressing at the same time the matrons, she went on to ask, “Have Miss\nLin’s luggage and effects been brought in? How many servants has she\nbrought along with her? Go, as soon as you can, and sweep two lower\nrooms and ask them to go and rest.”",
        "As she spake, tea and refreshments had already been served, and Hsi-feng\nherself handed round the cups and offered the fruits.",
        "Upon hearing the question further put by her maternal aunt Secunda,\n\"Whether the issue of the monthly allowances of money had been finished\nor not yet?” Hsi-feng replied: “The issue of the money has also been\ncompleted; but a few moments back, when I went along with several\nservants to the back upper-loft, in search of the satins, we looked for\never so long, but we saw nothing of the kind of satins alluded to by\nyou, madame, yesterday; so may it not be that your memory misgives you?”",
        "“Whether there be any or not, of that special kind, is of no\nconsequence,” observed madame Wang. “You should take out,” she therefore\nwent on to add, “any two pieces which first come under your hand, for\nthis cousin of yours to make herself dresses with; and in the evening,\nif I don’t forget, I’ll send some one to fetch them.”",
        "“I’ve in fact already made every provision,” rejoined Hsi-feng; “knowing\nvery well that my cousin would be arriving within these two days, I have\nhad everything got ready for her. And when you, madame, go back, if you\nwill pass an eye over everything, I shall be able to send them round.”",
        "Madame Wang gave a smile, nodded her head assentingly, but uttered not a\nword by way of reply.",
        "The tea and fruit had by this time been cleared, and dowager lady Chia\ndirected two old nurses to take Tai-yü to go and see her two maternal\nuncles; whereupon Chia She’s wife, madame Hsing, hastily stood up and\nwith a smiling face suggested, “I’ll take my niece over; for it will\nafter all be considerably better if I go!”",
        "“Quite so!” answered dowager lady Chia, smiling; “you can go home too,\nand there will be no need for you to come over again!”",
        "Madame Hsing expressed her assent, and forthwith led Tai-yü to take\nleave of madame Wang. The whole party escorted them as far as the door\nof the Entrance Hall, hung with creepers, where several youths had drawn\na carriage, painted light blue, with a kingfisher-coloured hood.",
        "Madame Hsing led Tai-yü by the hand and they got up into their seats.\nThe whole company of matrons put the curtain down, and then bade the\nyouths raise the carriage; who dragged it along, until they came to an\nopen space, where they at length put the mules into harness.",
        "Going out again by the eastern side gate, they proceeded in an easterly\ndirection, passed the main entrance of the Jung mansion, and entered a\nlofty doorway painted black. On the arrival in front of the ceremonial\ngate, they at once dismounted from the curricle, and madame Hsing,\nhand-in-hand with Tai-yü, walked into the court.",
        "“These grounds,” surmised Tai-yü to herself, “must have been originally\nconverted from a piece partitioned from the garden of the Jung mansion.”",
        "Having entered three rows of ceremonial gates they actually caught sight\nof the main structure, with its vestibules and porches, all of which,\nthough on a small scale, were full of artistic and unique beauty. They\nwere nothing like the lofty, imposing, massive and luxurious style of\narchitecture on the other side, yet the avenues and rockeries, in the\nvarious places in the court, were all in perfect taste.",
        "When they reached the interior of the principal pavilion, a large\nconcourse of handmaids and waiting maids, got up in gala dress, were\nalready there to greet them. Madame Hsing pressed Tai-yü into a seat,\nwhile she bade some one go into the outer library and request Mr. Chia\nShe to come over.",
        "In a few minutes the servant returned. “Master,” she explained, “says:\n’that he has not felt quite well for several days, that as the meeting\nwith Miss Lin will affect both her as well as himself, he does not for\nthe present feel equal to seeing each other, that he advises Miss Lin\nnot to feel despondent or homesick; that she ought to feel quite at home\nwith her venerable ladyship, (her grandmother,) as well as her maternal\naunts; that her cousins are, it is true, blunt, but that if all the\nyoung ladies associated together in one place, they may also perchance\ndispel some dulness; that if ever (Miss Lin) has any grievance, she\nshould at once speak out, and on no account feel a stranger; and\neverything will then be right.”",
        "Tai-yü lost no time in respectfully standing up, resuming her seat after\nshe had listened to every sentence of the message to her. After a while,\nshe said goodbye, and though madame Hsing used every argument to induce\nher to stay for the repast and then leave, Tai-yü smiled and said, “I\nshouldn’t under ordinary circumstances refuse the invitation to dinner,\nwhich you, aunt, in your love kindly extend to me, but I have still to\ncross over and pay my respects to my maternal uncle Secundus; if I went\ntoo late, it would, I fear, be a lack of respect on my part; but I shall\naccept on another occasion. I hope therefore that you will, dear aunt,\nkindly excuse me.”",
        "“If such be the case,” madame Hsing replied, “it’s all right.” And\npresently directing two nurses to take her niece over, in the carriage,\nin which they had come a while back, Tai-yü thereupon took her leave;\nmadame Hsing escorting her as far as the ceremonial gate, where she gave\nsome further directions to all the company of servants. She followed the\ncurricle with her eyes so long as it remained in sight, and at length\nretraced her footsteps.",
        "Tai-yü shortly entered the Jung Mansion, descended from the carriage,\nand preceded by all the nurses, she at once proceeded towards the east,\nturned a corner, passed through an Entrance Hall, running east and west,\nand walked in a southern direction, at the back of the Large Hall. On\nthe inner side of a ceremonial gate, and at the upper end of a spacious\ncourt, stood a large main building, with five apartments, flanked on\nboth sides by out-houses (stretching out) like the antlers on the head\nof deer; side-gates, resembling passages through a hill, establishing a\nthorough communication all round; (a main building) lofty, majestic,\nsolid and grand, and unlike those in the compound of dowager lady Chia.",
        "Tai-yü readily concluded that this at last was the main inner suite of\napartments. A raised broad road led in a straight line to the large\ngate. Upon entering the Hall, and raising her head, she first of all\nperceived before her a large tablet with blue ground, upon which figured\nnine dragons of reddish gold. The inscription on this tablet consisted\nof three characters as large as a peck-measure, and declared that this\nwas the Hall of Glorious Felicity.",
        "At the end, was a row of characters of minute size, denoting the year,\nmonth and day, upon which His Majesty had been pleased to confer the\ntablet upon Chia Yuan, Duke of Jung Kuo. Besides this tablet, were\nnumberless costly articles bearing the autograph of the Emperor. On the\nlarge black ebony table, engraved with dragons, were placed three\nantique blue and green bronze tripods, about three feet in height. On\nthe wall hung a large picture representing black dragons, such as were\nseen in waiting chambers of the Sui dynasty. On one side stood a gold\ncup of chased work, while on the other, a crystal casket. On the ground\nwere placed, in two rows, sixteen chairs, made of hard-grained cedar.",
        "There was also a pair of scrolls consisting of black-wood antithetical\ntablets, inlaid with the strokes of words in chased gold. Their burden\nwas this:",
        "  On the platform shine resplendent pearls like sun or moon,\n  And the sheen of the Hall façade gleams like russet sky.",
        "Below, was a row of small characters, denoting that the scroll had been\nwritten by the hand of Mu Shih, a fellow-countryman and old friend of\nthe family, who, for his meritorious services, had the hereditary title\nof Prince of Tung Ngan conferred upon him.",
        "The fact is that madame Wang was also not in the habit of sitting and\nresting, in this main apartment, but in three side-rooms on the east, so\nthat the nurses at once led Tai-yü through the door of the eastern wing.\r",
        "On a stove-couch, near the window, was spread a foreign red carpet. On\nthe side of honour, were laid deep red reclining-cushions, with dragons,\nwith gold cash (for scales), and an oblong brown-coloured\nsitting-cushion with gold-cash-spotted dragons. On the two sides, stood\none of a pair of small teapoys of foreign lacquer of peach-blossom\npattern. On the teapoy on the left, were spread out Wen Wang tripods,\nspoons, chopsticks and scent-bottles. On the teapoy on the right, were\nvases from the Ju Kiln, painted with girls of great beauty, in which\nwere placed seasonable flowers; (on it were) also teacups, a tea service\nand the like articles.",
        "On the floor on the west side of the room, were four chairs in a row,\nall of which were covered with antimacassars, embroidered with\nsilverish-red flowers, while below, at the feet of these chairs, stood\nfour footstools. On either side, was also one of a pair of high teapoys,\nand these teapoys were covered with teacups and flower vases.",
        "The other nick-nacks need not be minutely described.",
        "The old nurses pressed Tai-yü to sit down on the stove-couch; but, on\nperceiving near the edge of the couch two embroidered cushions, placed\none opposite the other, she thought of the gradation of seats, and did\nnot therefore place herself on the couch, but on a chair on the eastern\nside of the room; whereupon the waiting maids, in attendance in these\nquarters, hastened to serve the tea.",
        "While Tai-yü was sipping her tea, she observed the headgear, dress,\ndeportment and manners of the several waiting maids, which she really\nfound so unlike what she had seen in other households. She had hardly\nfinished her tea, when she noticed a waiting maid approach, dressed in a\nred satin jacket, and a waistcoat of blue satin with scollops.",
        "“My lady requests Miss Lin to come over and sit with her,” she remarked\nas she put on a smile.",
        "The old nurses, upon hearing this message, speedily ushered Tai-yü again\nout of this apartment, into the three-roomed small main building by the\neastern porch.",
        "On the stove-couch, situated at the principal part of the room, was\nplaced, in a transverse position, a low couch-table, at the upper end of\nwhich were laid out, in a heap, books and a tea service. Against the\npartition-wall, on the east side, facing the west, was a reclining\npillow, made of blue satin, neither old nor new.",
        "Madame Wang, however, occupied the lower seat, on the west side, on\nwhich was likewise placed a rather shabby blue satin sitting-rug, with a\nback-cushion; and upon perceiving Tai-yü come in she urged her at once\nto sit on the east side.",
        "Tai-yü concluded, in her mind, that this seat must certainly belong to\nChia Cheng, and espying, next to the couch, a row of three chairs,\ncovered with antimacassars, strewn with embroidered flowers, somewhat\nalso the worse for use, Tai-yü sat down on one of these chairs.",
        "But as madame Wang pressed her again and again to sit on the couch,\nTai-yü had at length to take a seat next to her.",
        "“Your uncle,” madame Wang explained, “is gone to observe this day as a\nfast day, but you’ll see him by and bye. There’s, however, one thing I\nwant to talk to you about. Your three female cousins are all, it is\ntrue, everything that is nice; and you will, when later on you come\ntogether for study, or to learn how to do needlework, or whenever, at\nany time, you romp and laugh together, find them all most obliging; but\nthere’s one thing that causes me very much concern. I have here one, who\nis the very root of retribution, the incarnation of all mischief, one\nwho is a ne’er-do-well, a prince of malignant spirits in this family. He\nis gone to-day to pay his vows in the temple, and is not back yet, but\nyou will see him in the evening, when you will readily be able to judge\nfor yourself. One thing you must do, and that is, from this time forth,\nnot to pay any notice to him. All these cousins of yours don’t venture\nto bring any taint upon themselves by provoking him.”",
        "Tai-yü had in days gone by heard her mother explain that she had a\nnephew, born into the world, holding a piece of jade in his mouth, who\nwas perverse beyond measure, who took no pleasure in his books, and\nwhose sole great delight was to play the giddy dog in the inner\napartments; that her maternal grandmother, on the other hand, loved him\nso fondly that no one ever presumed to call him to account, so that\nwhen, in this instance, she heard madame Wang’s advice, she at once felt\ncertain that it must be this very cousin.",
        "“Isn’t it to the cousin born with jade in his mouth, that you are\nalluding to, aunt?” she inquired as she returned her smile. “When I was\nat home, I remember my mother telling me more than once of this very\ncousin, who (she said) was a year older than I, and whose infant name\nwas Pao-yü. She added that his disposition was really wayward, but that\nhe treats all his cousins with the utmost consideration. Besides, now\nthat I have come here, I shall, of course, be always together with my\nfemale cousins, while the boys will have their own court, and separate\nquarters; and how ever will there be any cause of bringing any slur upon\nmyself by provoking him?”",
        "“You don’t know the reasons (that prompt me to warn you),” replied\nmadame Wang laughingly. “He is so unlike all the rest, all because he\nhas, since his youth up, been doated upon by our old lady! The fact is\nthat he has been spoilt, through over-indulgence, by being always in the\ncompany of his female cousins! If his female cousins pay no heed to him,\nhe is, at any rate, somewhat orderly, but the day his cousins say one\nword more to him than usual, much trouble forthwith arises, at the\noutburst of delight in his heart. That’s why I enjoin upon you not to\nheed him. From his mouth, at one time, issue sugared words and\nmellifluous phrases; and at another, like the heavens devoid of the sun,\nhe becomes a raving fool; so whatever you do, don’t believe all he\nsays.”",
        "Tai-yü was assenting to every bit of advice as it was uttered, when\nunexpectedly she beheld a waiting-maid walk in. “Her venerable ladyship\nover there,” she said, “has sent word about the evening meal.”",
        "Madame Wang hastily took Tai-yü by the hand, and emerging by the door of\nthe back-room, they went eastwards by the verandah at the back. Past the\nside gate, was a roadway, running north and south. On the southern side\nwere a pavilion with three divisions and a Reception Hall with a\ncolonnade. On the north, stood a large screen wall, painted white;\nbehind it was a very small building, with a door of half the ordinary\nsize.",
        "“These are your cousin Feng’s rooms,” explained madame Wang to Tai-yü,\nas she pointed to them smiling. “You’ll know in future your way to come\nand find her; and if you ever lack anything, mind you mention it to her,\nand she’ll make it all right.”",
        "At the door of this court, were also several youths, who had recently\nhad the tufts of their hair tied together, who all dropped their hands\nagainst their sides, and stood in a respectful posture. Madame Wang then\nled Tai-yü by the hand through a corridor, running east and west, into\nwhat was dowager lady Chia’s back-court. Forthwith they entered the door\nof the back suite of rooms, where stood, already in attendance, a large\nnumber of servants, who, when they saw madame Wang arrive, set to work\nsetting the tables and chairs in order.",
        "Chia Chu’s wife, née Li, served the eatables, while Hsi-feng placed the\nchopsticks, and madame Wang brought the soup in. Dowager lady Chia was\nseated all alone on the divan, in the main part of the apartment, on the\ntwo sides of which stood four vacant chairs.",
        "Hsi-feng at once drew Tai-yü, meaning to make her sit in the foremost\nchair on the left side, but Tai-yü steadily and concedingly declined.",
        "“Your aunts and sisters-in-law, standing on the right and left,” dowager\nlady Chia smilingly explained, “won’t have their repast in here, and as\nyou’re a guest, it’s but proper that you should take that seat.”",
        "Then alone it was that Tai-yü asked for permission to sit down, seating\nherself on the chair.",
        "Madame Wang likewise took a seat at old lady Chia’s instance; and the\nthree cousins, Ying Ch’un and the others, having craved for leave to sit\ndown, at length came forward, and Ying Ch’un took the first chair on the\nright, T’an Ch’un the second, and Hsi Ch’un the second on the left.\nWaiting maids stood by holding in their hands, flips and finger-bowls\nand napkins, while Mrs. Li and lady Feng, the two of them, kept near the\ntable advising them what to eat, and pressing them to help themselves.",
        "In the outer apartments, the married women and waiting-maids in\nattendance, were, it is true, very numerous; but not even so much as the\nsound of the cawing of a crow could be heard.",
        "The repast over, each one was presented by a waiting-maid, with tea in a\nsmall tea tray; but the Lin family had all along impressed upon the mind\nof their daughter that in order to show due regard to happiness, and to\npreserve good health, it was essential, after every meal, to wait a\nwhile, before drinking any tea, so that it should not do any harm to the\nintestines. When, therefore, Tai-yü perceived how many habits there were\nin this establishment unlike those which prevailed in her home, she too\nhad no alternative but to conform herself to a certain extent with them.\nUpon taking over the cup of tea, servants came once more and presented\nfinger-bowls for them to rinse their mouths, and Tai-yü also rinsed\nhers; and after they had all again finished washing their hands, tea was\neventually served a second time, and this was, at length, the tea that\nwas intended to be drunk.",
        "“You can all go,” observed dowager lady Chia, “and let us alone to have\na chat.”",
        "Madame Wang rose as soon as she heard these words, and having made a few\nirrelevant remarks, she led the way and left the room along with the two\nladies, Mrs. Li and lady Feng.",
        "Dowager lady Chia, having inquired of Tai-yü what books she was reading,\n\"I have just begun reading the Four Books,” Tai-yü replied. “What books\nare my cousins reading?” Tai-yü went on to ask.",
        "“Books, you say!” exclaimed dowager lady Chia; “why all they know are a\nfew characters, that’s all.”",
        "The sentence was barely out of her lips, when a continuous sounding of\nfootsteps was heard outside, and a waiting maid entered and announced\nthat Pao-yü was coming. Tai-yü was speculating in her mind how it was\nthat this Pao-yü had turned out such a good-for-nothing fellow, when he\nhappened to walk in.",
        "He was, in fact, a young man of tender years, wearing on his head, to\nhold his hair together, a cap of gold of purplish tinge, inlaid with\nprecious gems. Parallel with his eyebrows was attached a circlet,\nembroidered with gold, and representing two dragons snatching a pearl.\nHe wore an archery-sleeved deep red jacket, with hundreds of butterflies\nworked in gold of two different shades, interspersed with flowers; and\nwas girded with a sash of variegated silk, with clusters of designs, to\nwhich was attached long tassels; a kind of sash worn in the palace. Over\nall, he had a slate-blue fringed coat of Japanese brocaded satin, with\neight bunches of flowers in relief; and wore a pair of light blue satin\nwhite-soled, half-dress court-shoes.",
        "His face was like the full moon at mid-autumn; his complexion, like\nmorning flowers in spring; the hair along his temples, as if chiselled\nwith a knife; his eyebrows, as if pencilled with ink; his nose like a\nsuspended gallbladder (a well-cut and shapely nose); his eyes like\nvernal waves; his angry look even resembled a smile; his glance, even\nwhen stern, was full of sentiment.",
        "Round his neck he had a gold dragon necklet with a fringe; also a cord\nof variegated silk, to which was attached a piece of beautiful jade.",
        "As soon as Tai-yü became conscious of his presence, she was quite taken\naback. “How very strange!” she was reflecting in her mind; “it would\nseem as if I had seen him somewhere or other, for his face appears\nextremely familiar to my eyes;” when she noticed Pao-yü face dowager\nlady Chia and make his obeisance. “Go and see your mother and then come\nback,” remarked her venerable ladyship; and at once he turned round and\nquitted the room.",
        "On his return, he had already changed his hat and suit. All round his\nhead, he had a fringe of short hair, plaited into small queues, and\nbound with red silk. The queues were gathered up at the crown, and all\nthe hair, which had been allowed to grow since his birth, was plaited\ninto a thick queue, which looked as black and as glossy as lacquer.\nBetween the crown of the head and the extremity of the queue, hung a\nstring of four large pearls, with pendants of gold, representing the\neight precious things. On his person, he wore a long silvery-red coat,\nmore or less old, bestrewn with embroidery of flowers. He had still\nround his neck the necklet, precious gem, amulet of Recorded Name,\nphilacteries, and other ornaments. Below were partly visible a fir-cone\ncoloured brocaded silk pair of trousers, socks spotted with black\ndesigns, with ornamented edges, and a pair of deep red, thick-soled\nshoes.",
        "(Got up as he was now,) his face displayed a still whiter appearance, as\nif painted, and his eyes as if they were set off with carnation. As he\nrolled his eyes, they brimmed with love. When he gave utterance to\nspeech, he seemed to smile. But the chief natural pleasing feature was\nmainly centred in the curve of his eyebrows. The ten thousand and one\nfond sentiments, fostered by him during the whole of his existence, were\nall amassed in the corner of his eyes.",
        "His outward appearance may have been pleasing to the highest degree, but\nyet it was no easy matter to fathom what lay beneath it.",
        "There are a couple of roundelays, composed by a later poet, (after the\nexcellent rhythm of the) Hsi Chiang Yueh, which depict Pao-yü in a most\nadequate manner.",
        "The roundelays run as follows:",
        "  To gloom and passion prone, without a rhyme,\n  Inane and madlike was he many a time,\n  His outer self, forsooth, fine may have been,\n  But one wild, howling waste his mind within:\r\n  Addled his brain that nothing he could see;\n  A dunce! to read essays so loth to be!\n  Perverse in bearing, in temper wayward;\n  For human censure he had no regard.\n  When rich, wealth to enjoy he knew not how;\n  When poor, to poverty he could not bow.\n  Alas! what utter waste of lustrous grace!\n  To state, to family what a disgrace!\n  Of ne’er-do-wells below he was the prime,\n  Unfilial like him none up to this time.\n  Ye lads, pampered with sumptuous fare and dress,\n  Beware! In this youth’s footsteps do not press!",
        "But to proceed with our story.",
        "“You have gone and changed your clothes,” observed dowager lady Chia,\n\"before being introduced to the distant guest. Why don’t you yet salute\nyour cousin?”",
        "Pao-yü had long ago become aware of the presence of a most beautiful\nyoung lady, who, he readily concluded, must be no other than the\ndaughter of his aunt Lin. He hastened to advance up to her, and make his\nbow; and after their introduction, he resumed his seat, whence he\nminutely scrutinised her features, (which he thought) so unlike those of\nall other girls.",
        "Her two arched eyebrows, thick as clustered smoke, bore a certain not\nvery pronounced frowning wrinkle. She had a pair of eyes, which\npossessed a cheerful, and yet one would say, a sad expression,\noverflowing with sentiment. Her face showed the prints of sorrow stamped\non her two dimpled cheeks. She was beautiful, but her whole frame was\nthe prey of a hereditary disease. The tears in her eyes glistened like\nsmall specks. Her balmy breath was so gentle. She was as demure as a\nlovely flower reflected in the water. Her gait resembled a frail willow,\nagitated by the wind. Her heart, compared with that of Pi Kan, had one\nmore aperture of intelligence; while her ailment exceeded (in intensity)\nby three degrees the ailment of Hsi-Tzu.",
        "Pao-yü, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said,\n\"This cousin I have already seen in days gone by.”",
        "“There you are again with your nonsense,” exclaimed lady Chia,\nsneeringly; “how could you have seen her before?”",
        "“Though I may not have seen her, ere this,” observed Pao-yü with a\nsmirk, “yet when I look at her face, it seems so familiar, and to my\nmind, it would appear as if we had been old acquaintances; just as if,\nin fact, we were now meeting after a long separation.”",
        "“That will do! that will do!” remarked dowager lady Chia; “such being\nthe case, you will be the more intimate.”",
        "Pao-yü, thereupon, went up to Tai-yü, and taking a seat next to her,\ncontinued to look at her again with all intentness for a good long\nwhile.",
        "“Have you read any books, cousin?” he asked.",
        "“I haven’t as yet,” replied Tai-yü, “read any books, as I have only been\nto school for a year; all I know are simply a few characters.”",
        "“What is your worthy name, cousin?” Pao-yü went on to ask; whereupon\nTai-yü speedily told him her name.",
        "“Your style?” inquired Pao-yü; to which question Tai-yü replied, “I have\nno style.”",
        "“I’ll give you a style,” suggested Pao-yü smilingly; “won’t the double\nstyle ’P’in P’in,’ ’knitting brows,’ do very well?”",
        "“From what part of the standard books does that come?” T’an Ch’un\nhastily interposed.",
        "“It is stated in the Thorough Research into the state of Creation from\nremote ages to the present day,” Pao-yü went on to explain, “that, in\nthe western quarter, there exists a stone, called Tai, (black,) which\ncan be used, in lieu of ink, to blacken the eyebrows with. Besides the\neyebrows of this cousin taper in a way, as if they were contracted, so\nthat the selection of these two characters is most appropriate, isn’t\nit?”",
        "“This is just another plagiarism, I fear,” observed T’an Ch’un, with an\nironic smirk.",
        "“Exclusive of the Four Books,” Pao-yü remarked smilingly, “the majority\nof works are plagiarised; and is it only I, perchance, who plagiarise?\nHave you got any jade or not?” he went on to inquire, addressing Tai-yü,\n(to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant.",
        "“It’s because he has a jade himself,” Tai-yü forthwith reasoned within\nher mind, “that he asks me whether I have one or not.–No; I haven’t\none,” she replied. “That jade of yours is besides a rare object, and how\ncould every one have one?”",
        "As soon as Pao-yü heard this remark, he at once burst out in a fit of\nhis raving complaint, and unclasping the gem, he dashed it disdainfully\non the floor. “Rare object, indeed!” he shouted, as he heaped invective\non it; “it has no idea how to discriminate the excellent from the mean,\namong human beings; and do tell me, has it any perception or not? I too\ncan do without this rubbish!”",
        "All those, who stood below, were startled; and in a body they pressed\nforward, vying with each other as to who should pick up the gem.",
        "Dowager lady Chia was so distressed that she clasped Pao-yü in her\nembrace. “You child of wrath,” she exclaimed. “When you get into a\npassion, it’s easy enough for you to beat and abuse people; but what\nmakes you fling away that stem of life?”",
        "Pao-yü’s face was covered with the traces of tears. “All my cousins\nhere, senior as well as junior,” he rejoined, as he sobbed, “have no\ngem, and if it’s only I to have one, there’s no fun in it, I maintain!\nand now comes this angelic sort of cousin, and she too has none, so that\nit’s clear enough that it is no profitable thing.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia hastened to coax him. “This cousin of yours,” she\nexplained, “would, under former circumstances, have come here with a\njade; and it’s because your aunt felt unable, as she lay on her\ndeath-bed, to reconcile herself to the separation from your cousin, that\nin the absence of any remedy, she forthwith took the gem belonging to\nher (daughter), along with her (in the grave); so that, in the first\nplace, by the fulfilment of the rites of burying the living with the\ndead might be accomplished the filial piety of your cousin; and in the\nsecond place, that the spirit of your aunt might also, for the time\nbeing, use it to gratify the wish of gazing on your cousin. That’s why\nshe simply told you that she had no jade; for she couldn’t very well\nhave had any desire to give vent to self-praise. Now, how can you ever\ncompare yourself with her? and don’t you yet carefully and circumspectly\nput it on? Mind, your mother may come to know what you have done!”",
        "As she uttered these words, she speedily took the jade over from the\nhand of the waiting-maid, and she herself fastened it on for him.",
        "When Pao-yü heard this explanation, he indulged in reflection, but could\nnot even then advance any further arguments.",
        "A nurse came at the moment and inquired about Tai-yü’s quarters, and\ndowager lady Chia at once added, “Shift Pao-yü along with me, into the\nwarm room of my suite of apartments, and put your mistress, Miss Lin,\ntemporarily in the green gauze house; and when the rest of the winter is\nover, and repairs are taken in hand in spring in their rooms, an\nadditional wing can be put up for her to take up her quarters in.”",
        "“My dear ancestor,” ventured Pao-yü; “the bed I occupy outside the green\ngauze house is very comfortable; and what need is there again for me to\nleave it and come and disturb your old ladyship’s peace and quiet?”",
        "“Well, all right,” observed dowager lady Chia, after some consideration;\n\"but let each one of you have a nurse, as well as a waiting-maid to\nattend on you; the other servants can remain in the outside rooms and\nkeep night watch and be ready to answer any call.”",
        "At an early hour, besides, Hsi-feng had sent a servant round with a grey\nflowered curtain, embroidered coverlets and satin quilts and other such\narticles.",
        "Tai-yü had brought along with her only two servants; the one was her own\nnurse, dame Wang, and the other was a young waiting-maid of sixteen,\nwhose name was called Hsüeh Yen. Dowager lady Chia, perceiving that\nHsüeh Yen was too youthful and quite a child in her manner, while nurse\nWang was, on the other hand, too aged, conjectured that Tai-yü would, in\nall her wants, not have things as she liked, so she detached two\nwaiting-maids, who were her own personal attendants, named Tzu Chüan and\nYing Ko, and attached them to Tai-yü’s service. Just as had Ying Ch’un\nand the other girls, each one of whom had besides the wet nurses of\ntheir youth, four other nurses to advise and direct them, and exclusive\nof two personal maids to look after their dress and toilette, four or\nfive additional young maids to do the washing and sweeping of the rooms\nand the running about backwards and forwards on errands.",
        "Nurse Wang, Tzu Chüan and other girls entered at once upon their\nattendance on Tai-yü in the green gauze rooms, while Pao-yü’s wet-nurse,\ndame Li, together with an elderly waiting-maid, called Hsi Jen, were on\nduty in the room with the large bed.",
        "This Hsi Jen had also been, originally, one of dowager lady Chia’s\nservant-girls. Her name was in days gone by, Chen Chu. As her venerable\nladyship, in her tender love for Pao-yü, had feared that Pao-yü’s\nservant girls were not equal to their duties, she readily handed her to\nPao-yü, as she had hitherto had experience of how sincere and\nconsiderate she was at heart.",
        "Pao-yü, knowing that her surname was at one time Hua, and having once\nseen in some verses of an ancient poet, the line “the fragrance of\nflowers wafts itself into man,” lost no time in explaining the fact to\ndowager lady Chia, who at once changed her name into Hsi Jen.",
        "This Hsi Jen had several simple traits. While in attendance upon dowager\nlady Chia, in her heart and her eyes there was no one but her venerable\nladyship, and her alone; and now in her attendance upon Pao-yü, her\nheart and her eyes were again full of Pao-yü, and him alone. But as\nPao-yü was of a perverse temperament and did not heed her repeated\ninjunctions, she felt at heart exceedingly grieved.",
        "At night, after nurse Li had fallen asleep, seeing that in the inner\nchambers, Tai-yü, Ying Ko and the others had not as yet retired to rest,\nshe disrobed herself, and with gentle step walked in.",
        "“How is it, miss,” she inquired smiling, “that you have not turned in as\nyet?”",
        "Tai-yü at once put on a smile. “Sit down, sister,” she rejoined,\npressing her to take a seat. Hsi Jen sat on the edge of the bed.",
        "“Miss Lin,” interposed Ying Ko smirkingly, “has been here in an awful\nstate of mind! She has cried so to herself, that her eyes were flooded,\nas soon as she dried her tears. ’It’s only to-day that I’ve come,’ she\nsaid, ’and I’ve already been the cause of the outbreak of your young\nmaster’s failing. Now had he broken that jade, as he hurled it on the\nground, wouldn’t it have been my fault? Hence it was that she was so\nwounded at heart, that I had all the trouble in the world, before I\ncould appease her.”",
        "“Desist at once, Miss! Don’t go on like this,” Hsi Jen advised her;\n\"there will, I fear, in the future, happen things far more strange and\nridiculous than this; and if you allow yourself to be wounded and\naffected to such a degree by a conduct such as his, you will, I\napprehend, suffer endless wounds and anguish; so be quick and dispel\nthis over-sensitive nature!”",
        "“What you sisters advise me,” replied Tai-yü, “I shall bear in mind, and\nit will be all right.”",
        "They had another chat, which lasted for some time, before they at length\nretired to rest for the night.",
        "The next day, (she and her cousins) got up at an early hour and went\nover to pay their respects to dowager lady Chia, after which upon coming\nto madame Wang’s apartments, they happened to find madame Wang and\nHsi-feng together, opening the letters which had arrived from Chin Ling.\nThere were also in the room two married women, who had been sent from\nmadame Wang’s elder brother’s wife’s house to deliver a message.",
        "Tai-yü was, it is true, not aware of what was up, but T’an Ch’un and the\nothers knew that they were discussing the son of her mother’s sister,\nmarried in the Hsüeh family, in the city of Chin Ling, a cousin of\ntheirs, Hsüeh P’an, who relying upon his wealth and influence had, by\nassaulting a man, committed homicide, and who was now to be tried in the\ncourt of the Ying T’ien Prefecture.",
        "Her maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t’eng, had now, on the receipt of the\ntidings, despatched messengers to bring over the news to the Chia\nfamily. But the next chapter will explain what was the ultimate issue of\nthe wish entertained in this mansion to send for the Hsüeh family to\ncome to the capital.",
        "  An ill-fated girl happens to meet an ill-fated young man.\n  The Hu Lu Bonze adjudicates the Hu Lu case.",
        "Tai-yü, for we shall now return to our story, having come, along with\nher cousin to madame Wang’s apartments, found madame Wang discussing\ncertain domestic occurrences with the messengers, who had arrived from\nher elder brother’s wife’s home, and conversing also about the case of\nhomicide, in which the family of her mother’s sister had become\ninvolved, and other such relevant topics. Perceiving how pressing and\nperplexing were the matters in which madame Wang was engaged, the young\nladies promptly left her apartments, and came over to the rooms of their\nwidow sister-in-law, Mrs. Li.",
        "This Mrs. Li had originally been the spouse of Chia Chu. Although Chu\nhad died at an early age, he had the good fortune of leaving behind him\na son, to whom the name of Chia Lan was given. He was, at this period,\njust in his fifth year, and had already entered school, and applied\nhimself to books.",
        "This Mrs. Li was also the daughter of an official of note in Chin Ling.\nHer father’s name was Li Shou-chung, who had, at one time, been Imperial\nLibationer. Among his kindred, men as well as women had all devoted\nthemselves to poetry and letters; but ever since Li Shou-chung continued\nthe line of succession, he readily asserted that the absence of literary\nattainments in his daughter was indeed a virtue, so that it soon came\nabout that she did not apply herself in real earnest to learning; with\nthe result that all she studied were some parts of the “Four Books for\nwomen,” and the “Memoirs of excellent women,” that all she read did not\nextend beyond a limited number of characters, and that all she committed\nto memory were the examples of these few worthy female characters of\ndynasties of yore; while she attached special importance to spinning and\nfemale handiwork. To this reason is to be assigned the name selected for\nher, of Li Wan (Li, the weaver), and the style of Kung Ts’ai (Palace\nSempstress).",
        "Hence it was that, though this Li Wan still continued, after the loss of\nher mate, while she was as yet in the spring of her life, to live amidst\naffluence and luxury, she nevertheless resembled in every respect a\nblock of rotten wood or dead ashes. She had no inclination whatsoever to\ninquire after anything or to listen to anything; while her sole and\nexclusive thought was to wait upon her relatives and educate her son;\nand, in addition to this, to teach her young sisters-in-law to do\nneedlework and to read aloud.",
        "Tai-yü was, it is true, at this period living as a guest in the Chia\nmansion, where she certainly had the several young ladies to associate\nwith her, but, outside her aged father, (she thought) there was really\nno need for her to extend affection to any of the rest.",
        "But we will now speak of Chia Yü-ts’un. Having obtained the appointment\nof Prefect of Ying T’ien, he had no sooner arrived at his post than a\ncharge of manslaughter was laid before his court. This had arisen from\nsome rivalry between two parties in the purchase of a slave-girl, either\nof whom would not yield his right; with the result that a serious\nassault occurred, which ended in homicide.",
        "Yü-ts’un had, with all promptitude, the servants of the plaintiffs\nbrought before him, and subjected them to an examination.",
        "“The victim of the assault,” the plaintiffs deposed, “was your servants’\nmaster. Having on a certain day, purchased a servant-girl, she\nunexpectedly turned out to be a girl who had been carried away and sold\nby a kidnapper. This kidnapper had, first of all, got hold of our\nfamily’s money, and our master had given out that he would on the third\nday, which was a propitious day, take her over into the house, but\nthis kidnapper stealthily sold her over again to the Hsüeh family. When\nwe came to know of this, we went in search of the seller to lay hold of\nhim, and bring back the girl by force. But the Hsüeh party has been all\nalong the bully of Chin Ling, full of confidence in his wealth,\nfull of presumption on account of his prestige; and his arrogant menials\nin a body seized our master and beat him to death. The murderous master\nand his crew have all long ago made good their escape, leaving no trace\nbehind them, while there only remain several parties not concerned in\nthe affair. Your servants have for a whole year lodged complaints, but\nthere has been no one to do our cause justice, and we therefore implore\nyour Lordship to have the bloodstained criminals arrested, and thus\nconduce to the maintenance of humanity and benevolence; and the living,\nas well as the dead, will feel boundless gratitude for this heavenly\nbounty.”",
        "When Yü-ts’un heard their appeal, he flew into a fiery rage. “What!” he\nexclaimed. “How could a case of such gravity have taken place as the\nmurder of a man, and the culprits have been allowed to run away\nscot-free, without being arrested? Issue warrants, and despatch\nconstables to at once lay hold of the relatives of the bloodstained\ncriminals and bring them to be examined by means of torture.”",
        "Thereupon he espied a Retainer, who was standing by the judgment-table,\nwink at him, signifying that he should not issue the warrants. Yü-t’sun\ngave way to secret suspicion, and felt compelled to desist.",
        "Withdrawing from the Court-room, he retired into a private chamber, from\nwhence he dismissed his followers, only keeping this single Retainer to\nwait upon him.",
        "The Retainer speedily advanced and paid his obeisance. “Your worship,\"\nhe said smiling, “has persistently been rising in official honours, and\nincreasing in wealth so that, in the course of about eight or nine\nyears, you have forgotten me.”",
        "“Your face is, however, extremely familiar,” observed Yü-ts’un, “but I\ncannot, for the moment, recall who you are.”",
        "“Honourable people forget many things,” remarked the Retainer, as he\nsmiled. “What! Have you even forgotten the place where you started in\nlife? and do you not remember what occurred, in years gone by, in the Hu\nLu Temple?”",
        "Yü-ts’un was filled with extreme astonishment; and past events then\nbegan to dawn upon him.",
        "The fact is that this Retainer had been at one time a young priest in\nthe Hu Lu temple; but as, after its destruction by fire, he had no place\nto rest his frame, he remembered how light and easy was, after all, this\nkind of occupation, and being unable to reconcile himself to the\nsolitude and quiet of a temple, he accordingly availed himself of his\nyears, which were as yet few, to let his hair grow, and become a\nretainer.",
        "Yü-ts’un had had no idea that it was he. Hastily taking his hand in his,\nhe smilingly observed, “You are, indeed, an old acquaintance!” and then\npressed him to take a seat, so as to have a chat with more ease, but the\nRetainer would not presume to sit down.",
        "“Friendships,” Yü-ts’un remarked, putting on a smiling expression,\n\"contracted in poor circumstances should not be forgotten! This is a\nprivate room; so that if you sat down, what would it matter?”",
        "The Retainer thereupon craved permission to take a seat, and sat down\ngingerly, all awry.",
        "“Why did you, a short while back,” Yü-ts’un inquired, “not allow me to\nissue the warrants?”",
        "“Your illustrious office,” replied the Retainer, “has brought your\nworship here, and is it likely you have not transcribed some philactery\nof your post in this province!”",
        "“What is an office-philactery?” asked Yü-ts’un with alacrity.",
        "“Now-a-days,” explained the Retainer, “those who become local officers\nprovide themselves invariably with a secret list, in which are entered\nthe names and surnames of the most influential and affluent gentry of\nnote in the province. This is in vogue in every province. Should\ninadvertently, at any moment, one give umbrage to persons of this\nstatus, why, not only office, but I fear even one’s life, it would be\ndifficult to preserve. That’s why these lists are called\noffice-philacteries. This Hsüeh family, just a while back spoken of, how\ncould your worship presume to provoke? This case in question affords no\ndifficulties whatever in the way of a settlement; but the prefects, who\nhave held office before you, have all, by doing violence to the feelings\nand good name of these people, come to the end they did.”",
        "As he uttered these words, he produced, from inside a purse which he had\nhandy, a transcribed office-philactery, which he handed over to\nYü-ts’un; who upon perusal, found it full of trite and unpolished\nexpressions of public opinion, with regard to the leading clans and\nnotable official families in that particular district. They ran as\nfollows:",
        "The “Chia” family is not “chia,” a myth; white jade form the Halls; gold\ncompose their horses! The “A Fang” Palace is three hundred li in extent,\nbut is no fit residence for a “Shih” of Chin Ling. The eastern seas lack\nwhite jade beds, and the “Lung Wang,” king of the Dragons, has come to\nask for one of the Chin Ling Wang, (Mr. Wang of Chin Ling.) In a\nplenteous year, snow, (Hsüeh,) is very plentiful; their pearls and gems\nare like sand, their gold like iron.",
        "Scarcely had Yü-ts’un done reading, when suddenly was heard the\nannouncement, communicated by the beating of a gong, that Mr. Wang had\ncome to pay his respects.",
        "Yü-ts’un hastily adjusted his official clothes and hat, and went out of\nthe room to greet and receive the visitor. Returning after a short while\nhe proceeded to question the Retainer (about what he had been perusing.)",
        "“These four families,” explained the Retainer, “are all interlaced by\nties of relationship, so that if you offend one, you offend all; if you\nhonour one, you honour all. For support and protection, they all have\nthose to take care of their interests! Now this Hsüeh, who is charged\nwith homicide, is indeed the Hsüeh implied by ’in a plenteous year,\n(Hsüeh,) snow, is very plentiful.’ In fact, not only has he these three\nfamilies to rely upon, but his (father’s) old friends, and his own\nrelatives and friends are both to be found in the capital, as well as\nabroad in the provinces; and they are, what is more, not few in number.\nWho is it then that your Worship purposes having arrested?”",
        "When Yü-ts’un had heard these remarks, he forthwith put on a smile and\ninquired of the Retainer, “If what you say be true, how is then this\nlawsuit to be settled? Are you also perchance well aware of the place of\nretreat of this homicide?”",
        "“I don’t deceive your Worship,” the Retainer ventured smiling, “when I\nsay that not only do I know the hiding-place of this homicide, but that\nI also am acquainted with the man who kidnapped and sold the girl; I\nlikewise knew full well the poor devil and buyer, now deceased. But\nwait, and I’ll tell your worship all, with full details. This person,\nwho succumbed to the assault, was the son of a minor gentry. His name\nwas Feng Yüan. His father and mother are both deceased, and he has\nlikewise no brothers. He looked after some scanty property in order to\neke out a living. His age was eighteen or nineteen; and he had a strong\npenchant for men’s, and not much for women’s society. But this was too\nthe retribution (for sins committed) in a previous existence! for\ncoming, by a strange coincidence, in the way of this kidnapper, who was\nselling the maid, he straightway at a glance fell in love with this\ngirl, and made up his mind to purchase her and make her his second wife;\nentering an oath not to associate with any male friends, nor even to\nmarry another girl. And so much in earnest was he in this matter that he\nhad to wait until after the third day before she could enter his\nhousehold (so as to make the necessary preparations for the marriage).\nBut who would have foreseen the issue? This kidnapper quietly disposed\nof her again by sale to the Hsüeh family; his intention being to pocket\nthe price-money from both parties, and effect his escape. Contrary to\nhis calculations, he couldn’t after all run away in time, and the two\nbuyers laid hold of him and beat him, till he was half dead; but neither\nof them would take his coin back, each insisting upon the possession of\nthe girl. But do you think that young gentleman, Mr. Hsüeh, would yield\nhis claim to her person? Why, he at once summoned his servants and bade\nthem have recourse to force; and, taking this young man Feng, they\nassailed him till they made mincemeat of him. He was then carried back\nto his home, where he finally died after the expiry of three days. This\nyoung Mr. Hsüeh had previously chosen a day, on which he meant to set\nout for the capital, and though he had beaten the young man Feng to\ndeath, and carried off the girl, he nevertheless behaved in the manner\nof a man who had had no concern in the affair. And all he gave his mind\nto was to take his family and go along on his way; but not in any wise\nin order to evade (the consequences) of this (occurrence). This case of\nhomicide, (he looked upon) as a most trivial and insignificant matter,\nwhich, (he thought), his brother and servants, who were on the spot,\nwould be enough to settle. But, however, enough of this person. Now does\nyour worship know who this girl is who was sold?”",
        "“How could I possibly know?” answered Yü-ts’un.",
        "“And yet,” remarked the Retainer, as he laughed coldly, “this is a\nperson to whom you are indebted for great obligations; for she is no one\nelse than the daughter of Mr. Chen, who lived next door to the Hu Lu\ntemple. Her infant name is ’Ying Lien.’”",
        "“What! is it really she?” exclaimed Yü-ts’un full of surprise. “I heard\nthat she had been kidnapped, ever since she was five years old; but has\nshe only been sold recently?”",
        "“Kidnappers of this kind,” continued the Retainer, “only abduct infant\ngirls, whom they bring up till they reach the age of twelve or thirteen,\nwhen they take them into strange districts and dispose of them through\ntheir agents. In days gone by, we used daily to coax this girl, Ying\nLien, to romp with us, so that we got to be exceedingly friendly. Hence\nit is that though, with the lapse of seven or eight years, her mien has\nassumed a more surpassingly lovely appearance, her general features\nhave, on the other hand, undergone no change; and this is why I can\nrecognise her. Besides, in the centre of her two eyebrows, she had a\nspot, of the size of a grain of rice, of carnation colour, which she has\nhad ever since she was born into the world. This kidnapper, it also\nhappened, rented my house to live in; and on a certain day, on which the\nkidnapper was not at home, I even set her a few questions. She said,\n’that the kidnapper had so beaten her, that she felt intimidated, and\ncouldn’t on any account, venture to speak out; simply averring that the\nkidnapper was her own father, and that, as he had no funds to repay his\ndebts, he had consequently disposed of her by sale!’ I tried time after\ntime to induce her to answer me, but she again gave way to tears and\nadded no more than: ’I don’t really remember anything of my youth.’ Of\nthis, anyhow, there can be no doubt; on a certain day the young man Feng\nand the kidnapper met, said the money was paid down; but as the\nkidnapper happened to be intoxicated, Ying Lien exclaimed, as she\nsighed: ’My punishment has this day been consummated!’ Later on again,\nwhen she heard that young Feng would, after three days, have her taken\nover to his house, she once more underwent a change and put on such a\nsorrowful look that, unable to brook the sight of it, I waited till the\nkidnapper went out, when I again told my wife to go and cheer her by\nrepresenting to her that this Mr. Feng’s fixed purpose to wait for a\npropitious day, on which to come and take her over, was ample proof that\nhe would not look upon her as a servant-girl. ’Furthermore,’ (explained\nmy wife to her), ’he is a sort of person exceedingly given to fast\nhabits, and has at home ample means to live upon, so that if, besides,\nwith his extreme aversion to women, he actually purchases you now, at a\nfancy price, you should be able to guess the issue, without any\nexplanation. You have to bear suspense only for two or three days, and\nwhat need is there to be sorrowful and dejected?’ After these\nassurances, she became somewhat composed, flattering herself that she\nwould from henceforth have a home of her own.",
        "“But who would believe that the world is but full of disappointments! On\nthe succeeding day, it came about that the kidnapper again sold her to\nthe Hsüeh family! Had he disposed of her to any other party, no harm\nwould anyhow have resulted; but this young gentleman Hsüeh, who is\nnicknamed by all, ’the Foolish and overbearing Prince,’ is the most\nperverse and passionate being in the whole world. What is more, he\nthrows money away as if it were dust. The day on which he gave the\nthrashing with blows like falling leaves and flowing water, he dragged\n(_lit. pull alive, drag dead) Ying Lien away more dead than alive,\nby sheer force, and no one, even up to this date, is aware whether she\nbe among the dead or the living. This young Feng had a spell of empty\nhappiness; for (not only) was his wish not fulfilled, but on the\ncontrary he spent money and lost his life; and was not this a lamentable\ncase?”",
        "When Yü-ts’un heard this account he also heaved a sigh. “This was\nindeed,” he observed, “a retribution in store for them! Their encounter\nwas likewise not accidental; for had it been, how was it that this Feng\nYüan took a fancy to Ying Lien?",
        "“This Ying Lien had, during all these years, to endure much harsh\ntreatment from the hands of the kidnapper, and had, at length, obtained\nthe means of escape; and being besides full of warm feeling, had he\nactually made her his wife, and had they come together, the event would\ncertainly have been happy; but, as luck would have it, there occurred\nagain this contretemps.",
        "“This Hsüeh is, it is true, more laden with riches and honours than Feng\nwas, but when we bear in mind what kind of man he is he certainly, with\nhis large bevy of handmaids, and his licentious and inordinate habits,\ncannot ever be held equal to Feng Yüan, who had set his heart upon one\nperson! This may appositely be termed a fantastic sentimental destiny,\nwhich, by a strange coincidence, befell a couple consisting of an\nill-fated young fellow and girl! But why discuss third parties? The only\nthing now is how to decide this case, so as to put things right.”",
        "“Your worship,” remarked the Retainer smiling, “displayed, in years gone\nby, such great intelligence and decision, and how is it that today you,\non the contrary, become a person without any resources! Your servant has\nheard that the promotion of your worship to fill up this office is due\nto the exertions of the Chia and Wang families; and as this Hsüeh P’an\nis a relative of the Chia mansion, why doesn’t your worship take your\ncraft along with the stream, and bring, by the performance of a\nkindness, this case to an issue, so that you may again in days to come,\nbe able to go and face the two Dukes Chia and Wang?”",
        "“What you suggest,” replied Yü-ts’un, “is, of course, right enough; but\nthis case involves a human life, and honoured as I have been, by His\nMajesty the Emperor, by a restoration to office, and selection to an\nappointment, how can I at the very moment, when I may strain all my\nenergies to show my gratitude, by reason of a private consideration, set\nthe laws at nought? This is a thing which I really haven’t the courage\nto do.”",
        "“What your worship says is naturally right and proper,” remarked the\nRetainer at these words, smiling sarcastically, “but at the present\nstage of the world, such things cannot be done. Haven’t you heard the\nsaying of a man of old to the effect that great men take action suitable\nto the times. ’He who presses,’ he adds, ’towards what is auspicious and\navoids what is inauspicious is a perfect man.’ From what your worship\nsays, not only you couldn’t, by any display of zeal, repay your\nobligation to His Majesty, but, what is more, your own life you will\nfind it difficult to preserve. There are still three more considerations\nnecessary to insure a safe settlement.”",
        "Yü-ts’un drooped his head for a considerable time.",
        "“What is there in your idea to be done?” he at length inquired.",
        "“Your servant,” responded the Retainer, “has already devised a most\nexcellent plan. It’s this: To-morrow, when your Lordship sits in court,\nyou should, merely for form’s sake, make much ado, by despatching\nletters and issuing warrants for the arrest of the culprits. The\nmurderer will naturally not be forthcoming; and as the plaintiffs will\nbe strong in their displeasure, you will of course have some members of\nthe clan of the Hsüeh family, together with a few servants and others,\ntaken into custody, and examined under torture, when your servant will\nbe behind the scenes to bring matters to a settlement, by bidding them\nreport that the victim had succumbed to a sudden ailment, and by urging\nthe whole number of the kindred, as well as the headmen of the place, to\nhand in a declaration to that effect. Your Worship can aver that you\nunderstand perfectly how to write charms in dust, and conjure the\nspirit; having had an altar, covered with dust, placed in the court, you\nshould bid the military and people to come and look on to their heart’s\ncontent. Your Worship can give out that the divining spirit has\ndeclared: ’that the deceased, Feng Yüan, and Hsüeh P’an had been enemies\nin a former life, that having now met in the narrow road, their\ndestinies were consummated; that Hsüeh P’an has, by this time,\ncontracted some indescribable disease and perished from the effects of\nthe persecution of the spirit of Feng.’ That as the calamity had\noriginated entirely from the action of the kidnapper, exclusive of\ndealing with the kidnapper according to law, the rest need not be\ninterfered with, and so on. Your servant will be in the background to\nspeak to the kidnapper and urge him to make a full confession; and when\npeople find that the response of the divining spirit harmonizes with the\nstatements of the kidnapper, they will, as a matter of course, entertain\nno suspicion.",
        "“The Hsüeh family have plenty of money, so that if your Worship\nadjudicates that they should pay five hundred, they can afford it, or\none thousand will also be within their means; and this sum can be handed\nto the Feng family to meet the outlay of burning incense and burial\nexpenses. The Feng family are, besides, people of not much consequence,\nand (the fuss made by them) being simply for money, they too will, when\nthey have got the cash in hand, have nothing more to say. But may it\nplease your worship to consider carefully this plan and see what you\nthink of it?”",
        "“It isn’t a safe course! It isn’t a safe course!” Yü-ts’un observed as\nhe smiled. “Let me further think and deliberate; and possibly by\nsucceeding in suppressing public criticism, the matter might also be\nsettled.”",
        "These two closed their consultation by a fixed determination, and the\nnext day, when he sat in judgment, he marked off a whole company of the\nplaintiffs as well as of the accused, as were mentioned by name, and had\nthem brought before him. Yü-ts’un examined them with additional\nminuteness, and discovered in point of fact, that the inmates of the\nFeng family were extremely few, that they merely relied upon this charge\nwith the idea of obtaining some compensation for joss-sticks and\nburials; and that the Hsüeh family, presuming on their prestige and\nconfident of patronage, had been obstinate in the refusal to make any\nmutual concession, with the result that confusion had supervened, and\nthat no decision had been arrived at.",
        "Following readily the bent of his feelings, Yü-ts’un disregarded the\nlaws, and adjudicated this suit in a random way; and as the Feng family\ncame in for a considerable sum, with which to meet the expense for\nincense and the funeral, they had, after all, not very much to say (in\nthe way of objections.)",
        "With all despatch, Yü-ts’un wrote and forwarded two letters, one to Chia\nCheng, and the other to Wang Tzu-t’eng, at that time commander-in-chief\nof a Metropolitan Division, simply informing them: that the case, in\nwhich their worthy nephew was concerned, had come to a close, and that\nthere was no need for them to give way to any extreme solicitude.",
        "This case had been settled through the exclusive action of the young\npriest of the Hu Lu temple, now an official Retainer; and Yü-ts’un,\napprehending, on the other hand, lest he might in the presence of\nothers, divulge the circumstances connected with the days gone by, when\nhe was in a state of penury, naturally felt very unhappy in his mind.\nBut at a later period, he succeeded, by ultimately finding in him some\nshortcoming, and deporting him to a far-away place, in setting his fears\nat rest.",
        "But we will put Yü-ts’un on one side, and refer to the young man Hsüeh,\nwho purchased Ying Lien, and assaulted Feng Yuan to death.",
        "He too was a native of Chin Ling and belonged to a family literary\nduring successive generations; but this young Hsüeh had recently, when\nof tender age, lost his father, and his widowed mother out of pity for\nhis being the only male issue and a fatherless child, could not help\ndoating on him and indulging him to such a degree, that when he, in\ncourse of time, grew up to years of manhood, he was good for nothing.",
        "In their home, furthermore, was the wealth of a millionaire, and they\nwere, at this time, in receipt of an income from His Majesty’s privy\npurse, for the purvey of various articles.",
        "This young Hsüeh went at school under the name of P’an. His style was\nWen Ch’i. His natural habits were extravagant; his language haughty and\nsupercilious. He had, of course, also been to school, but all he knew\nwas a limited number of characters, and those not well. The whole day\nlong, his sole delight was in cock-fighting and horse-racing, rambling\nover hills and doing the sights.",
        "Though a Purveyor, by Imperial appointment, he had not the least idea of\nanything relating to matters of business or of the world. All he was\ngood for was: to take advantage of the friendships enjoyed by his\ngrandfather in days of old, to present himself at the Board of Revenue\nto perfunctorily sign his name and to draw the allowance and rations;\nwhile the rest of his affairs he, needless to say, left his partners and\nold servants of the family to manage for him.",
        "His widowed mother, a Miss Wang, was the youngest sister of Wang\nTzu-t’eng, whose present office was that of Commander-in-Chief of a\nMetropolitan Division; and was, with Madame Wang, the spouse of Chia\nCheng, of the Jung Kuo Mansion, sisters born of one mother. She was, in\nthis year, more or less forty years of age and had only one son: this\nHsüeh P’an.",
        "She also had a daughter, who was two years younger than Hsüeh P’an, and\nwhose infant name was Pao Ch’ai. She was beautiful in appearance, and\nelegant and refined in deportment. In days gone by, when her father\nlived, he was extremely fond of this girl, and had her read books and\nstudy characters, so that, as compared with her brother, she was\nactually a hundred times his superior. Having become aware, ever since\nher father’s death, that her brother could not appease the anguish of\nher mother’s heart, she at once dispelled all thoughts of books, and\ngave her sole mind to needlework, to the menage and other such concerns,\nso as to be able to participate in her mother’s sorrow, and to bear the\nfatigue in lieu of her.",
        "As of late the Emperor on the Throne held learning and propriety in high\nesteem, His Majesty called together and singled out talent and ability,\nupon which he deigned to display exceptional grace and favour. Besides\nthe number called forth from private life and chosen as Imperial\nsecondary wives, the daughters of families of hereditary official status\nand renown were without exception, reported by name to the authorities,\nand communicated to the Board, in anticipation of the selection for\nmaids in waiting to the Imperial Princesses and daughters of Imperial\nPrinces in their studies, and for filling up the offices of persons of\neminence, to urge them to become excellent.",
        "Ever since the death of Hsüeh P’an’s father, the various assistants,\nmanagers and partners, and other employes in the respective provinces,\nperceiving how youthful Hsüeh P’an was in years, and how much he lacked\nworldly experience, readily availed themselves of the time to begin\nswindling and defrauding. The business, carried on in various different\nplaces in the capital, gradually also began to fall off and to show a\ndeficit.",
        "Hsüeh P’an had all along heard that the capital was the one place\nfor gaieties, and was just entertaining the idea of going on a visit,\nwhen he eagerly jumped at the opportunity (that presented itself,) first\nof all to escort his sister, who was going to wait for the selection, in\nthe second place to see his relatives, and in the third to enter\npersonally the capital, (professedly) to settle up long-standing\naccounts, and to make arrangements for new outlays, but, in reality,\nwith the sole purpose of seeing the life and splendour of the\nmetropolis.",
        "He therefore, had, at an early period, got ready his baggage and small\nluggage, as well as the presents for relatives and friends, things of\nevery description of local production, presents in acknowledgment of\nfavours received, and other such effects, and he was about to choose a\nday to start on his journey when unexpectedly he came in the way of the\nkidnapper who offered Ying Lien for sale. As soon as Hsüeh P’an saw how\ndistinguée Ying Lien was in her appearance, he formed the\nresolution of buying her; and when he encountered Feng Yüan, come with\nthe object of depriving him of her, he in the assurance of superiority,\ncalled his sturdy menials together, who set upon Feng Yüan and beat him\nto death. Forthwith collecting all the affairs of the household, and\nentrusting them one by one to the charge of some members of the clan and\nseveral elderly servants of the family, he promptly took his mother,\nsister and others and after all started on his distant journey, while\nthe charge of homicide he, however, treated as child’s play, flattering\nhimself that if he spent a few filthy pieces of money, there was no\ndoubt as to its settlement.",
        "He had been on his journey how many days, he had not reckoned, when, on\na certain day, as they were about to enter the capital, he furthermore\nheard that his maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t’eng, had been raised to the\nrank of Supreme Governor of nine provinces, and had been honoured with\nan Imperial command to leave the capital and inspect the frontiers.",
        "Hsüeh P’an was at heart secretly elated. “I was just lamenting,” he\nthought, “that on my visit to the capital, I would have my maternal\nuncle to exercise control over me, and that I wouldn’t be able to gambol\nand frisk to my heart’s content, but now that he is leaving the capital,\non promotion, it’s evident that Heaven accomplishes man’s wishes.”",
        "As he consequently held consultation with his mother; “Though we have,\"\nhe argued, “several houses of our own in the capital, yet for these last\nten years or so, there has been no one to live in them, and the people\ncharged with the looking after them must unavoidably have stealthily\nrented them to some one or other. It’s therefore needful to let servants\ngo ahead to sweep and get the place in proper order, before we can very\nwell go ourselves.”",
        "“What need is there to go to such trouble?” retorted his mother; “the\nmain object of our present visit to the capital is first of all to pay\nour respects to our relatives and friends; and it is, either at your\nelder uncle’s, my brother’s place, or at your other uncle’s, my sister’s\nhusband’s home, both of which families’ houses are extremely spacious,\nthat we can put up provisionally, and by and bye, at our ease, we can\nsend servants to make our house tidy. Now won’t this be a considerable\nsaving of trouble?”",
        "“My uncle, your brother,” suggested Hsüeh P’an, “has just been raised to\nan appointment in an outside province, so that, of course, in his house,\nthings must be topsy-turvey, on account of his departure; and should we\nbetake ourselves, like a hive of bees and a long trail, to him for\nshelter; won’t we appear very inconsiderate?”",
        "“Your uncle,” remarked his mother, “is, it is true, going on promotion,\nbut there’s besides the house of your aunt, my sister. What is more,\nduring these last few years from both your uncle’s and aunt’s have, time\nafter time, been sent messages, and letters forwarded, asking us to come\nover; and now that we’ve come, is it likely, though your uncle is busy\nwith his preparations to start on his journey, that your aunt of the\nChia family won’t do all she can to press us to stay? Besides, were we\nto have our house got ready in a scramble, won’t it make people think it\nstrange? I however know your idea very well that were we kept to stay at\nyour uncle’s and aunt’s, you won’t escape being under strict restraint,\nunlike what would be the case were we to live in our own house, as you\nwould be free then to act as you please! Such being the case, go, on\nyour own account, and choose some place to take up your quarters in,\nwhile I myself, who have been separated from your aunt and cousins for\nthese several years, would however like to stay with them for a few\ndays; and I’ll go along with your sister and look up your aunt at her\nhome. What do you say; will this suit you or not?”",
        "Hsüeh P’an, upon hearing his mother speak in this strain, knew well\nenough that he could not bring her round from her determination; and he\nhad no help but to issue the necessary directions to the servants to\nmake straight for the Jung Kuo mansion. Madame Wang had by this time\nalready come to know that in the lawsuit, in which Hsüeh P’an was\nconcerned, Chia Yü-ts’un had fortunately intervened and lent his good\noffices, and was at length more composed in her mind. But when she again\nsaw that her eldest brother had been advanced to a post on the frontier,\nshe was just deploring that, deprived of the intercourse of the\nrelatives of her mother’s family, how doubly lonely she would feel;\nwhen, after the lapse of a few days, some one of the household brought\nthe unexpected announcement that “our lady, your sister, has, with the\nyoung gentleman, the young lady and her whole household, entered the\ncapital and have dismounted from their vehicles outside the main\nentrance.” This news so delighted madame Wang that she rushed out, with\na few attendants, to greet them in the large Entrance Hall, and brought\nMrs. Hsüeh and the others into her house.",
        "The two sisters were now reunited, at an advanced period of their lives,\nso that mixed feelings of sorrow and joy thronged together, but on these\nit is, of course, needless to dilate.",
        "After conversing for a time on what had occurred, subsequent to their\nseparation, madame Wang took them to pay their obeisance to dowager lady\nChia. They then handed over the various kinds of presents and indigenous\narticles, and after the whole family had been introduced, a banquet was\nalso spread to greet the guests.",
        "Hsüeh P’an, having paid his respects to Chia Cheng and Chia Lien, was\nlikewise taken to see Chia She, Chia Chen and the other members.",
        "Chia Cheng sent a messenger to tell madame Wang that “’aunt’ Hsüeh had\nalready seen many springs and autumns, while their nephew was of tender\nage, with no experience, so that there was every fear, were he to live\noutside, that something would again take place. In the South-east corner\nof our compound,” (he sent word,) “there are in the Pear Fragrance\nCourt, over ten apartments, all of which are vacant and lying idle; and\nwere we to tell the servants to sweep them, and invite ’aunt’ Hsüeh and\nthe young gentleman and lady to take up their quarters there, it would\nbe an extremely wise thing.”",
        "Madame Wang had in fact been entertaining the wish to keep them to live\nwith them, when dowager lady Chia also sent some one to say that, “Mrs.\nHsüeh should be asked to put up in the mansion in order that a greater\nfriendliness should exist between them all.”",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh herself had all along been desirous to live in one place with\nher relatives, so as to be able to keep a certain check over her son,\nfearing that, if they lived in a separate house outside, the natural\nbent of his habits would run riot, and that some calamity would be\nbrought on; and she therefore, there and then, expressed her sense of\nappreciation, and accepted the invitation. She further privately told\nmadame Wang in clear terms, that every kind of daily expense and general\ncontribution would have to be entirely avoided and withdrawn as that\nwould be the only thing to justify her to make any protracted stay. And\nmadame Wang aware that she had, in her home, no difficulty in this line,\npromptly in fact complied with her wishes.",
        "From this date it was that “aunt” Hsüeh and her children took up their\nquarters in the Pear Fragrance Court.",
        "This Court of Pear Fragrance had, we must explain, been at one time used\nas a place for the quiet retirement of the Duke Jung in his advanced\nyears. It was on a small scale, but ingeniously laid out. There were, at\nleast, over ten structures. The front halls and the back houses were all\nin perfect style. There was a separate door giving on to the street, and\nthe people of the household of Hsüeh P’an used this door to go in and\nout. At the south-west quarter, there was also a side door, which\ncommunicated with a narrow roadway. Beyond this narrow road, was the\neastern court of madame Wang’s principal apartment; so that every day,\neither after her repast, or in the evening, Mrs. Hsüeh would readily\ncome over and converse, on one thing and another, with dowager lady\nChia, or have a chat with madame Wang; while Pao-ch’ai came together,\nday after day, with Tai yü, Ying-ch’un, her sisters and the other girls,\neither to read, to play chess, or to do needlework, and the pleasure\nwhich they derived was indeed perfect.\r\n\r\nHsüeh P’an however had all along from the first instance, been loth to\nlive in the Chia mansion, as he dreaded that with the discipline\nenforced by his uncle, he would not be able to be his own master; but\nhis mother had made up her mind so positively to remain there, and what\nwas more, every one in the Chia mansion was most pressing in their\nefforts to keep them, that there was no alternative for him but to take\nup his quarters temporarily there, while he at the same time directed\nservants to go and sweep the apartments of their own house, with a view\nthat they should move into them when they were ready.",
        "But, contrary to expectation, after they had been in their quarters for\nnot over a month, Hsüeh P’an came to be on intimate relations with all\nthe young men among the kindred of the Chia mansion, the half of whom\nwere extravagant in their habits, so that great was, of course, his\ndelight to frequent them. To-day, they would come together to drink\nwine; the next day to look at flowers. They even assembled to gamble, to\ndissipate and to go everywhere and anywhere; leading, with all their\nenticements, Hsüeh P’an so far astray, that he became far worse, by a\nhundred times, than he was hitherto.",
        "Although it must be conceded that Chia Cheng was in the education of his\nchildren quite correct, and in the control of his family quite\nsystematic, yet in the first place, the clan was so large and the\nmembers so numerous, that he was unable to attend to the entire\nsupervision; and, in the second place, the head of the family, at this\nperiod, was Chia Chen, who, as the eldest grandchild of the Ning\nmansion, had likewise now come into the inheritance of the official\nstatus, with the result that all matters connected with the clan\ndevolved upon his sole and exclusive control. In the third place, public\nas well as private concerns were manifold and complex, and being a man\nof negligent disposition, he estimated ordinary affairs of so little\nconsequence that any respite from his official duties he devoted to no\nmore than the study of books and the playing of chess.",
        "Furthermore, this Pear Fragrance Court was separated by two rows of\nbuildings from his quarters and was also provided with a separate door\nopening into the street, so that, being able at their own heart’s desire\nto go out and to come in, these several young fellows could well indulge\ntheir caprices, and gratify the bent of their minds.",
        "Hence it was that Hsüeh P’an, in course of time gradually extinguished\nfrom his memory every idea of shifting their quarters.",
        "But what transpired, on subsequent days, the following chapter will\nexplain.",
        "  The spirit of Chia Pao-yü visits the confines of the Great Void.\n  The Monitory Vision Fairy expounds, in ballads, the Dream of the Red\n      Chamber.",
        "Having in the fourth Chapter explained, to some degree, the\ncircumstances attending the settlement of the mother and children of the\nHsüeh family in the Jung mansion, and other incidental matters, we will\nnow revert to Lin Tai-yü.",
        "Ever since her arrival in the Jung mansion, dowager lady Chia showed her\nthe highest sympathy and affection, so that in everything connected with\nsleeping, eating, rising and accommodation she was on the same footing\nas Pao-yü; with the result that Ying Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and T’an Ch’un,\nher three granddaughters, had after all to take a back seat. In fact,\nthe intimate and close friendliness and love which sprung up between the\ntwo persons Pao-yü and Tai-yü, was, in the same degree, of an\nexceptional kind, as compared with those existing between the others. By\ndaylight they were wont to walk together, and to sit together. At night,\nthey would desist together, and rest together. Really it was a case of\nharmony in language and concord in ideas, of the consistency of varnish\nor of glue, (a close friendship), when at this unexpected juncture there\ncame this girl, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai, who, though not very much older in\nyears (than the others), was, nevertheless, in manner so correct, and in\nfeatures so beautiful that the consensus of opinion was that Tai-yü\nherself could not come up to her standard.",
        "What is more, in her ways Pao-Ch’ai was so full of good tact, so\nconsiderate and accommodating, so unlike Tai-yü, who was supercilious,\nself-confident, and without any regard for the world below, that the\nnatural consequence was that she soon completely won the hearts of the\nlower classes. Even the whole number of waiting-maids would also for the\nmost part, play and joke with Pao-ch’ai. Hence it was that Tai-yü\nfostered, in her heart, considerable feelings of resentment, but of this\nhowever Pao-ch’ai had not the least inkling.",
        "Pao-yü was, likewise, in the prime of his boyhood, and was, besides, as\nfar as the bent of his natural disposition was concerned, in every\nrespect absurd and perverse; regarding his cousins, whether male or\nfemale, one and all with one common sentiment, and without any\ndistinction whatever between the degrees of distant or close\nrelationship. Sitting and sleeping, as he now was under the same roof\nwith Tai-yü in dowager lady Chia’s suite of rooms, he naturally became\ncomparatively more friendly with her than with his other cousins; and\nthis friendliness led to greater intimacy and this intimacy once\nestablished, rendered unavoidable the occurrence of the blight of\nharmony from unforeseen slight pretexts.",
        "These two had had on this very day, for some unknown reason, words\nbetween them more or less unfriendly, and Tai-yü was again sitting all\nalone in her room, giving way to tears. Pao-yü was once more within\nhimself quite conscience-smitten for his ungraceful remarks, and coming\nforward, he humbly made advances, until, at length, Tai-yü little by\nlittle came round.",
        "As the plum blossom, in the eastern part of the garden of the Ning\nmansion, was in full bloom, Chia Chen’s spouse, Mrs. Yu, made\npreparations for a collation, (purposing) to send invitations to dowager\nlady Chia, mesdames Hsing, and Wang, and the other members of the\nfamily, to come and admire the flowers; and when the day arrived the\nfirst thing she did was to take Chia Jung and his wife, the two of them,\nand come and ask them round in person. Dowager lady Chia and the other\ninmates crossed over after their early meal; and they at once promenaded\nthe Hui Fang (Concentrated Fragrance) Garden. First tea was served, and\nnext wine; but the entertainment was no more than a family banquet of\nthe kindred of the two mansions of Ning and Jung, so that there was a\ntotal lack of any novel or original recreation that could be put on\nrecord.",
        "After a little time, Pao-yü felt tired and languid and inclined for his\nmidday siesta. “Take good care,” dowager lady Chia enjoined some of\nthem, “and stay with him, while he rests for a while, when he can come\nback;” whereupon Chia Jung’s wife, Mrs. Ch’in, smiled and said with\neagerness: “We got ready in here a room for uncle Pao, so let your\nvenerable ladyship set your mind at ease. Just hand him over to my\ncharge, and he will be quite safe. Mothers and sisters,” she continued,\naddressing herself to Pao-yü’s nurses and waiting maids, “invite uncle\nPao to follow me in here.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia had always been aware of the fact that Mrs. Ch’in was\na most trustworthy person, naturally courteous and scrupulous, and in\nevery action likewise so benign and gentle; indeed the most estimable\namong the whole number of her great grandsons’ wives, so that when she\nsaw her about to go and attend to Pao-yü, she felt that, for a\ncertainty, everything would be well.",
        "Mrs. Ch’in, there and then, led away a company of attendants, and came\ninto the rooms inside the drawing room. Pao-yü, upon raising his head,\nand catching sight of a picture hung on the upper wall, representing a\nhuman figure, in perfect style, the subject of which was a portrait of\nYen Li, speedily felt his heart sink within him.",
        "There was also a pair of scrolls, the text of which was:",
        "  A thorough insight into worldly matters arises from knowledge;\n  A clear perception of human nature emanates from literary lore.",
        "On perusal of these two sentences, albeit the room was sumptuous and\nbeautifully laid out, he would on no account remain in it. “Let us go at\nonce,” he hastened to observe, “let us go at once.”",
        "Mrs. Ch’in upon hearing his objections smiled. “If this,” she said, “is\nreally not nice, where are you going? if you won’t remain here, well\nthen come into my room.”",
        "Pao-yü nodded his head and gave a faint grin.",
        "“Where do you find the propriety,” a nurse thereupon interposed, “of an\nuncle going to sleep in the room of a nephew’s wife?”",
        "“Ai ya!” exclaimed Mrs. Ch’in laughing, “I don’t mind whether he gets\nangry or not (at what I say); but how old can he be as to reverentially\nshun all these things? Why my brother was with me here last month;\ndidn’t you see him? he’s, true enough, of the same age as uncle Pao, but\nwere the two of them to stand side by side, I suspect that he would be\nmuch higher in stature.”",
        "“How is it,” asked Pao-yü, “that I didn’t see him? Bring him along and\nlet me have a look at him!”",
        "“He’s separated,” they all ventured as they laughed, “by a distance of\ntwenty or thirty li, and how can he be brought along? but you’ll see him\nsome day.”",
        "As they were talking, they reached the interior of Mrs. Ch’in’s\napartments. As soon as they got in, a very faint puff of sweet fragrance\nwas wafted into their nostrils. Pao-yü readily felt his eyes itch and\nhis bones grow weak. “What a fine smell!” he exclaimed several\nconsecutive times.",
        "Upon entering the apartments, and gazing at the partition wall, he saw a\npicture the handiwork of T’ang Po-hu, consisting of Begonias drooping in\nthe spring time; on either side of which was one of a pair of scrolls,\nwritten by Ch’in Tai-hsü, a Literary Chancellor of the Sung era, running\nas follows:",
        "  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man, because the spring\n      is cold.\n  The fragrant whiff, which wafts itself into man’s nose, is the perfume\n      of wine!",
        "On the table was a mirror, one which had been placed, in days of yore,\nin the Mirror Palace of the Emperor Wu Tse-t’ien. On one side stood a\ngold platter, in which Fei Yen, who lived in the Ch’ao state, used to\nstand and dance. In this platter, was laid a quince, which An Lu-shan\nhad flung at the Empress T’ai Chen, inflicting a wound on her breast. In\nthe upper part of the room, stood a divan ornamented with gems, on which\nthe Emperor’s daughter, Shou Ch’ang, was wont to sleep, in the Han Chang\nPalace Hanging, were curtains embroidered with strings of pearls, by\nT’ung Ch’ang, the Imperial Princess.",
        "“It’s nice in here, it’s nice in here,” exclaimed Pao-yü with a chuckle.",
        "“This room of mine,” observed Mrs. Ch’in smilingly, “is I think, good\nenough for even spirits to live in!” and, as she uttered these words,\nshe with her own hands, opened a gauze coverlet, which had been washed\nby Hsi Shih, and removed a bridal pillow, which had been held in the\narms of Hung Niang. Instantly, the nurses attended to Pao-yü, until he\nhad laid down comfortably; when they quietly dispersed, leaving only the\nfour waiting maids: Hsi Jen, Ch’iu Wen, Ch’ing Wen and She Yueh to keep\nhim company.",
        "“Mind be careful, as you sit under the eaves,” Mrs. Ch’in recommended\nthe young waiting maids, “that the cats do not start a fight!”",
        "Pao-yü then closed his eyes, and, little by little, became drowsy, and\nfell asleep.",
        "It seemed to him just as if Mrs. Ch’in was walking ahead of him.\nForthwith, with listless and unsettled step, he followed Mrs. Ch’in to\nsome spot or other, where he saw carnation-like railings, jade-like\nsteps, verdant trees and limpid pools–a spot where actually no trace of\nany human being could be met with, where of the shifting mundane dust\nlittle had penetrated.",
        "Pao-yü felt, in his dream, quite delighted. “This place,” he mused, “is\npleasant, and I may as well spend my whole lifetime in here! though I\nmay have to lose my home, I’m quite ready for the sacrifice, for it’s\nfar better being here than being flogged, day after day, by father,\nmother, and teacher.”",
        "While he pondered in this erratic strain, he suddenly heard the voice of\nsome human being at the back of the rocks, giving vent to this song:",
        "  Like scattering clouds doth fleet a vernal dream;\n  The transient flowers pass like a running stream;\n  Maidens and youths bear this, ye all, in mind;\n  In useless grief what profit will ye find?",
        "Pao-yü perceived that the voice was that of a girl. The song was barely\nat an end, when he soon espied in the opposite direction, a beautiful\ngirl advancing with majestic and elastic step; a girl quite unlike any\nordinary mortal being. There is this poem, which gives an adequate\ndescription of her:",
        "  Lo she just quits the willow bank; and sudden now she issues from the\n      flower-bedecked house;\n  As onward alone she speeds, she startles the birds perched in the\n      trees, by the pavilion; to which as she draws nigh, her shadow\n      flits by the verandah!\n  Her fairy clothes now flutter in the wind! a fragrant perfume like\n      unto musk or olea is wafted in the air; Her apparel lotus-like is\n      sudden wont to move; and the jingle of her ornaments strikes the\n      ear.\n  Her dimpled cheeks resemble, as they smile, a vernal peach; her\n      kingfisher coiffure is like a cumulus of clouds; her lips part\n      cherry-like; her pomegranate-like teeth conceal a fragrant\n      breath.\n  Her slender waist, so beauteous to look at, is like the skipping snow\n      wafted by a gust of wind; the sheen of her pearls and kingfisher\n      trinkets abounds with splendour, green as the feathers of a duck,\n      and yellow as the plumes of a goose;\n  Now she issues to view, and now is hidden among the flowers; beautiful\n      she is when displeased, beautiful when in high spirits; with\n      lissome step, she treads along the pond, as if she soars on wings\n      or sways in the air.\n  Her eyebrows are crescent moons, and knit under her smiles; she\n      speaks, and yet she seems no word to utter; her lotus-like feet\n      with ease pursue their course; she stops, and yet she seems still\n      to be in motion; the charms of her figure all vie with ice in\n      purity, and in splendour with precious gems; Lovely is her\n      brilliant attire, so full of grandeur and refined grace.\n  Loveable her countenance, as if moulded from some fragrant substance,\n      or carved from white jade; elegant is her person, like a phoenix,\n      dignified like a dragon soaring high.\n  What is her chastity like? Like a white plum in spring with snow\n      nestling in its broken skin; Her purity? Like autumn orchids\n      bedecked with dewdrops.\n  Her modesty? Like a fir-tree growing in a barren plain; Her\n      comeliness? Like russet clouds reflected in a limpid pool.\n  Her gracefulness? Like a dragon in motion wriggling in a stream;\n      Her refinement? Like the rays of the moon shooting on to a cool\n      river.\n  Sure is she to put Hsi Tzu to shame! Bound to put Wang Ch’iang to the\n      blush! What a remarkable person! Where was she born? and whence\n      does she come?\n  One thing is true that in Fairy-land there is no second like her! that\n      in the Purple Courts of Heaven there is no one fit to be her peer!\n  Forsooth, who can it be, so surpassingly beautiful!",
        "Pao-yü, upon realising that she was a fairy, was much elated; and with\neagerness advanced and made a bow.",
        "“My divine sister,” he ventured, as he put on a smile. “I don’t know\nwhence you come, and whither you are going. Nor have I any idea what\nthis place is, but I make bold to entreat that you would take my hand\nand lead me on.”",
        "“My abode,” replied the Fairy, “is above the Heavens of Divested\nAnimosities, and in the ocean of Discharged Sorrows. I’m the Fairy of\nMonitory Vision, of the cave of Drooping Fragrance, in the mount of\nEmitted Spring, within the confines of the Great Void. I preside over\nthe voluptuous affections and sensual debts among the mortal race, and\nsupervise in the dusty world, the envies of women and the lusts of man.\nIt’s because I’ve recently come to hear that the retribution for\nvoluptuousness extends up to this place, that I betake myself here in\norder to find suitable opportunities of disseminating mutual affections.\nMy encounter with you now is also not a matter of accident! This spot is\nnot distant from my confines. I have nothing much there besides a cup of\nthe tender buds of tea plucked by my own hands, and a pitcher of\nluscious wine, fermented by me as well as several spritelike singing and\ndancing maidens of great proficiency, and twelve ballads of spiritual\nsong, recently completed, on the Dream of the Red Chamber; but won’t you\ncome along with me for a stroll?”",
        "Pao-yü, at this proposal, felt elated to such an extraordinary degree\nthat he could skip from joy, and there and then discarding from his mind\nall idea of where Mrs. Ch’in was, he readily followed the Fairy.",
        "They reached some spot, where there was a stone tablet, put up in a\nhorizontal position, on which were visible the four large characters:\n\"The confines of the Great Void,” on either side of which was one of a\npair of scrolls, with the two antithetical sentences:",
        "  When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false;\n  When naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught!",
        "Past the Portal stood the door of a Palace, and horizontally, above this\ndoor, were the four large characters: “The Sea of Retribution, the\nHeaven of Love.” There were also a pair of scrolls, with the inscription\nin large characters:",
        "  Passion, alas! thick as the earth, and lofty as the skies, from ages\n      past to the present hath held incessant sway;\n  How pitiful your lot! ye lustful men and women envious, that your\n      voluptuous debts should be so hard to pay!",
        "Pao-yü, after perusal, communed with his own heart. “Is it really so!\"\nhe thought, “but I wonder what implies the passion from old till now,\nand what are the voluptuous debts! Henceforward, I must enlighten\nmyself!”",
        "Pao-yü was bent upon this train of thoughts when he unwittingly\nattracted several evil spirits into his heart, and with speedy step he\nfollowed in the track of the fairy, and entered two rows of doors when\nhe perceived that the Lateral Halls were, on both sides, full of tablets\nand scrolls, the number of which he could not in one moment ascertain.\nHe however discriminated in numerous places the inscriptions: The Board\nof Lustful Love; the Board of contracted grudges; The Board of Matutinal\nsobs; the Board of nocturnal tears; the Board of vernal affections; and\nthe Board of autumnal anguish.",
        "After he had perused these inscriptions, he felt impelled to turn round\nand address the Fairy. “May I venture to trouble my Fairy,” he said, “to\ntake me along for a turn into the interior of each of these Boards? May\nI be allowed, I wonder, to do so?”",
        "“Inside each of these Boards,” explained the Fairy, “are accumulated the\nregisters with the records of all women of the whole world; of those who\nhave passed away, as well as of those who have not as yet come into it,\nand you, with your mortal eyes and human body, could not possibly be\nallowed to know anything in anticipation.”",
        "But would Pao-yü, upon hearing these words, submit to this decree? He\nwent on to implore her permission again and again, until the Fairy\ncasting her eye upon the tablet of the board in front of her observed,\n\"Well, all right! you may go into this board and reap some transient\npleasure.”",
        "Pao-yü was indescribably joyous, and, as he raised his head, he\nperceived that the text on the tablet consisted of the three characters:\nthe Board of Ill-fated lives; and that on each side was a scroll with\nthe inscription:",
        "  Upon one’s self are mainly brought regrets in spring and autumn gloom;\n  A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike too; but beauty all for whom?",
        "Upon perusal of the scroll Pao-yü was, at once, the more stirred with\nadmiration; and, as he crossed the door, and reached the interior, the\nonly things that struck his eye were about ten large presses, the whole\nnumber of which were sealed with paper slips; on every one of these\nslips, he perceived that there were phrases peculiar to each province.",
        "Pao-yü was in his mind merely bent upon discerning, from the rest, the\nslip referring to his own native village, when he espied, on the other\nside, a slip with the large characters: “the Principal Record of the\nTwelve Maidens of Chin Ling.”",
        "“What is the meaning,” therefore inquired Pao-yü, “of the Principal\nRecord of the Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling?”",
        "“As this is the record,” explained the Fairy, “of the most excellent and\nprominent girls in your honourable province, it is, for this reason,\ncalled the Principal Record.”",
        "“I’ve often heard people say,” observed Pao-yü, “that Chin Ling is of\nvast extent; and how can there only be twelve maidens in it! why, at\npresent, in our own family alone, there are more or less several\nhundreds of young girls!”",
        "The Fairy gave a faint smile. “Through there be,” she rejoined, “so\nlarge a number of girls in your honourable province, those only of any\nnote have been selected and entered in this record. The two presses, on\nthe two sides, contain those who are second best; while, for all who\nremain, as they are of the ordinary run, there are, consequently, no\nregisters to make any entry of them in.”",
        "Pao-yü upon looking at the press below, perceived the inscription:\n\"Secondary Record of the twelve girls of Chin Ling;” while again in\nanother press was inscribed: “Supplementary Secondary Record of the\nTwelve girls of Chin Ling.” Forthwith stretching out his hand, Pao-yü\nopened first the doors of the press, containing the “supplementary\nsecondary Record,” extracted a volume of the registers, and opened it.\nWhen he came to examine it, he saw on the front page a representation of\nsomething, which, though bearing no resemblance to a human being,\npresented, at the same time, no similitude to scenery; consisting simply\nof huge blotches made with ink. The whole paper was full of nothing else\nbut black clouds and turbid mists, after which appeared the traces of a\nfew characters, explaining that–",
        "  A cloudless moon is rare forsooth to see,\n  And pretty clouds so soon scatter and flee!\n  Thy heart is deeper than the heavens are high,\n  Thy frame consists of base ignominy!\n  Thy looks and clever mind resentment will provoke,\n  And thine untimely death vile slander will evoke!\n  A loving noble youth in vain for love will yearn.",
        "After reading these lines, Pao-yü looked below, where was pictured a\nbouquet of fresh flowers and a bed covered with tattered matting. There\nwere also several distiches running as follows:",
        "  Thy self-esteem for kindly gentleness is but a fancy vain!\n  Thy charms that they can match the olea or orchid, but thoughts inane!\n  While an actor will, envious lot! with fortune’s smiles be born,\n  A youth of noble birth will, strange to say, be luckless and forlorn.",
        "Pao-yü perused these sentences, but could not unfold their meaning, so,\nat once discarding this press, he went over and opened the door of the\npress of the “Secondary Records” and took out a book, in which, on\nexamination, he found a representation of a twig of Olea fragrans.\nBelow, was a pond, the water of which was parched up and the mud dry,\nthe lotus flowers decayed, and even the roots dead. At the back were\nthese lines:",
        "  The lotus root and flower but one fragrance will give;\n  How deep alas! the wounds of thy life’s span will be;\n  What time a desolate tree in two places will live,\n  Back to its native home the fragrant ghost will flee!",
        "Pao-yü read these lines, but failed to understand what they meant. He\nthen went and fetched the “Principal Record,” and set to looking it\nover. He saw on the first page a picture of two rotten trees, while on\nthese trees was suspended a jade girdle. There was also a heap of snow,\nand under this snow was a golden hair-pin. There were in addition these\nfour lines in verse:",
        "  Bitter thy cup will be, e’en were the virtue thine to stop the loom,\n  Thine though the gift the willow fluff to sing, pity who will thy\n      doom?\n  High in the trees doth hang the girdle of white jade,\n  And lo! among the snow the golden pin is laid!",
        "To Pao-yü the meaning was again, though he read the lines over, quite\nunintelligible. He was, about to make inquiries, but he felt convinced\nthat the Fairy would be both to divulge the decrees of Heaven; and\nthough intent upon discarding the book, he could not however tear\nhimself away from it. Forthwith, therefore, he prosecuted a further\nperusal of what came next, when he caught sight of a picture of a bow.\nOn this bow hung a citron. There was also this ode:",
        "  Full twenty years right and wrong to expound will be thy fate!\n  What place pomegranate blossoms come in bloom will face the Palace\n      Gate!\n  The third portion of spring, of the first spring in beauty short will\n      fall!\n  When tiger meets with hare thou wilt return to sleep perennial.",
        "Further on, was also a sketch of two persons flying a kite; a broad\nexpanse of sea, and a large vessel; while in this vessel was a girl, who\nscreened her face bedewed with tears. These four lines were likewise\nvisible:",
        "  Pure and bright will be thy gifts, thy purpose very high;\n  But born thou wilt be late in life and luck be passed by;\n  At the tomb feast thou wilt repine tearful along the stream,\n  East winds may blow, but home miles off will be, even in dream.",
        "After this followed a picture of several streaks of fleeting clouds, and\nof a creek whose waters were exhausted, with the text:",
        "  Riches and honours too what benefit are they?\n  In swaddling clothes thou’lt be when parents pass away;\n  The rays will slant, quick as the twinkle of an eye;\n  The Hsiang stream will recede, the Ch’u clouds onward fly!",
        "Then came a picture of a beautiful gem, which had fallen into the mire,\nwith the verse:",
        "  Thine aim is chastity, but chaste thou wilt not be;\n  Abstraction is thy faith, but void thou may’st not see;\n  Thy precious, gemlike self will, pitiful to say,\n  Into the mundane mire collapse at length some day.",
        "A rough sketch followed of a savage wolf, in pursuit of a beautiful\ngirl, trying to pounce upon her as he wished to devour her. This was the\nburden of the distich:",
        "  Thy mate is like a savage wolf prowling among the hills;\n  His wish once gratified a haughty spirit his heart fills!\n  Though fair thy form like flowers or willows in the golden moon,\n  Upon the yellow beam to hang will shortly be its doom.",
        "Below, was an old temple, in the interior of which was a beautiful\nperson, just in the act of reading the religious manuals, as she sat all\nalone; with this inscription:",
        "  In light esteem thou hold’st the charms of the three springs for their\n      short-liv’d fate;\n  Thine attire of past years to lay aside thou chang’st, a Taoist dress\n      to don;\n  How sad, alas! of a reputed house and noble kindred the scion,\n  Alone, behold! she sleeps under a glimmering light, an old idol for\n      mate.",
        "Next in order came a hill of ice, on which stood a hen-phoenix, while\nunder it was this motto:",
        "  When time ends, sure coincidence, the phoenix doth alight;\n  The talents of this human form all know and living see,\n  For first to yield she kens, then to control, and third genial to be;\n  But sad to say, things in Chin Ling are in more sorry plight.",
        "This was succeeded by a representation of a desolate village, and a\ndreary inn. A pretty girl sat in there, spinning thread. These were the\nsentiments affixed below:",
        "  When riches will have flown will honours then avail?\n  When ruin breaks your home, e’en relatives will fail!\n  But sudden through the aid extended to Dame Liu,\n  A friend in need fortune will make to rise for you.",
        "Following these verses, was drawn a pot of Orchids, by the side of\nwhich, was a beautiful maiden in a phoenix-crown and cloudy mantle\n(bridal dress); and to this picture was appended this device:",
        "  What time spring wanes, then fades the bloom of peach as well as plum!\n  Who ever can like a pot of the olea be winsome!\n  With ice thy purity will vie, vain their envy will be!\n  In vain a laughing-stock people will try to make of thee.",
        "At the end of this poetical device, came the representation of a lofty\nedifice, on which was a beauteous girl, suspending herself on a beam to\ncommit suicide; with this verse:",
        "  Love high as heav’n, love ocean-wide, thy lovely form will don;\n  What time love will encounter love, license must rise wanton;\n  Why hold that all impiety in Jung doth find its spring,\n  The source of trouble, verily, is centred most in Ning.",
        "Pao-yü was still bent upon prosecuting his perusal, when the Fairy\nperceiving that his intellect was eminent and bright, and his natural\ntalents quickwitted, and apprehending lest the decrees of heaven should\nbe divulged, hastily closed the Book of Record, and addressed herself to\nPao-yü. “Come along with me,” she said smiling, “and see some wonderful\nscenery. What’s the need of staying here and beating this gourd of\nennui?”",
        "In a dazed state, Pao-yü listlessly discarded the record, and again\nfollowed in the footsteps of the Fairy. On their arrival at the back, he\nsaw carnation portières, and embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars,\nand carved eaves. But no words can adequately give an idea of the\nvermilion apartments glistening with splendour, of the floors garnished\nwith gold, of the snow reflecting lustrous windows, of the palatial\nmansions made of gems. He also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful and\nfragrant, and extraordinary vegetation, full of perfume. The spot was\nindeed elysian.",
        "He again heard the Fairy observe with a smiling face: “Come out all of\nyou at once and greet the honoured guest!”",
        "These words were scarcely completed, when he espied fairies walk out of\nthe mansion, all of whom were, with their dangling lotus sleeves, and\ntheir fluttering feather habiliments, as comely as spring flowers, and\nas winsome as the autumn moon. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü,\nthey all, with one voice, resentfully reproached the Monitory Vision\nFairy. “Ignorant as to who the honoured guest could be,” they argued,\n\"we hastened to come out to offer our greetings simply because you,\nelder sister, had told us that, on this day, and at this very time,\nthere would be sure to come on a visit, the spirit of the younger sister\nof Chiang Chu. That’s the reason why we’ve been waiting for ever so\nlong; and now why do you, in lieu of her, introduce this vile object to\ncontaminate the confines of pure and spotless maidens?”",
        "As soon as Pao-yü heard these remarks, he was forthwith plunged in such\na state of consternation that he would have retired, but he found it\nimpossible to do so. In fact, he felt the consciousness of the foulness\nand corruption of his own nature quite intolerable. The Monitory Vision\nFairy promptly took Pao-yü’s hand in her own, and turning towards her\nyounger sisters, smiled and explained: “You, and all of you, are not\naware of the why and wherefore. To-day I did mean to have gone to the\nJung mansion to fetch Chiang Chu, but as I went by the Ning mansion, I\nunexpectedly came across the ghosts of the two dukes of Jung and Ning,\nwho addressed me in this wise: ’Our family has, since the dynasty\nestablished itself on the Throne, enjoyed merit and fame, which pervaded\nmany ages, and riches and honours transmitted from generation to\ngeneration. One hundred years have already elapsed, but this good\nfortune has now waned, and this propitious luck is exhausted; so much so\nthat they could not be retrieved! Our sons and grandsons may be many,\nbut there is no one among them who has the means to continue the family\nestate, with the exception of our kindred grandson, Pao-yü alone, who,\nthough perverse in disposition and wayward by nature, is nevertheless\nintelligent and quick-witted and qualified in a measure to give effect\nto our hopes. But alas! the good fortune of our family is entirely\ndecayed, so that we fear there is no person to incite him to enter the\nright way! Fortunately you worthy fairy come at an unexpected moment,\nand we venture to trust that you will, above all things, warn him\nagainst the foolish indulgence of inordinate desire, lascivious\naffections and other such things, in the hope that he may, at your\ninstigation, be able to escape the snares of those girls who will allure\nhim with their blandishments, and to enter on the right track; and we\ntwo brothers will be ever grateful.’",
        "“On language such as this being addressed to me, my feelings of\ncommiseration naturally burst forth; and I brought him here, and bade\nhim, first of all, carefully peruse the records of the whole lives of\r\nthe maidens in his family, belonging to the three grades, the upper,\nmiddle and lower, but as he has not yet fathomed the import, I have\nconsequently led him into this place to experience the vision of\ndrinking, eating, singing and licentious love, in the hope, there is no\nsaying, of his at length attaining that perception.”",
        "Having concluded these remarks, she led Pao-yü by the hand into the\napartment, where he felt a whiff of subtle fragrance, but what it was\nthat reached his nostrils he could not tell.",
        "To Pao-yü’s eager and incessant inquiries, the Fairy made reply with a\nsardonic smile. “This perfume,” she said, “is not to be found in the\nworld, and how could you discern what it is? This is made of the essence\nof the first sprouts of rare herbs, growing on all hills of fame and\nplaces of superior excellence, admixed with the oil of every species of\nsplendid shrubs in precious groves, and is called the marrow of\nConglomerated Fragrance.”",
        "At these words Pao-yü was, of course, full of no other feeling than\nwonder.",
        "The whole party advanced and took their seats, and a young maidservant\npresented tea, which Pao-yü found of pure aroma, of excellent flavour\nand of no ordinary kind. “What is the name of this tea?” he therefore\nasked; upon which the Fairy explained. “This tea,” she added,\n\"originates from the Hills of Emitted Spring and the Valley of Drooping\nFragrance, and is, besides, brewed in the night dew, found on spiritual\nplants and divine leaves. The name of this tea is ’one thousand red in\none hole.’”",
        "At these words Pao-yü nodded his head, and extolled its qualities.\nEspying in the room lutes, with jasper mountings, and tripods, inlaid\nwith gems, antique paintings, and new poetical works, which were to be\nseen everywhere, he felt more than ever in a high state of delight.\nBelow the windows, were also shreds of velvet sputtered about and a\ntoilet case stained with the traces of time and smudged with cosmetic;\nwhile on the partition wall was likewise suspended a pair of scrolls,\nwith the inscription:",
        "  A lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook!\n  What help is there, but Heaven’s will to brook?",
        "Pao-yü having completed his inspection felt full of admiration, and\nproceeded to ascertain the names and surnames of the Fairies. One was\ncalled the Fairy of Lustful Dreams; another “the High Ruler of\nPropagated Passion;” the name of one was “the Golden Maiden of\nPerpetuated Sorrow;” of another the “Intelligent Maiden of Transmitted\nHatred.” (In fact,) the respective Taoist appellations were not of one\nand the same kind.",
        "In a short while, young maid-servants came in and laid the table, put\nthe chairs in their places, and spread out wines and eatables. There\nwere actually crystal tankards overflowing with luscious wines, and\namber glasses full to the brim with pearly strong liquors. But still\nless need is there to give any further details about the sumptuousness\nof the refreshments.",
        "Pao-yü found it difficult, on account of the unusual purity of the\nbouquet of the wine, to again restrain himself from making inquiries\nabout it.",
        "“This wine,” observed the Monitory Dream Fairy, “is made of the twigs of\nhundreds of flowers, and the juice of ten thousands of trees, with the\naddition of must composed of unicorn marrow, and yeast prepared with\nphoenix milk. Hence the name of ’Ten thousand Beauties in one Cup’ was\ngiven to it.”",
        "Pao-yü sang its incessant praise, and, while he sipped his wine, twelve\ndancing girls came forward, and requested to be told what songs they\nwere to sing.",
        "“Take,” suggested the Fairy, “the newly-composed Twelve Sections of the\nDream of the Red Chamber, and sing them.”",
        "The singing girls signified their obedience, and forthwith they lightly\nclapped the castagnettes and gently thrummed the virginals. These were\nthe words which they were heard to sing:",
        "  At the time of the opening of the heavens and the laying out of the\n      earth chaos prevailed.",
        "They had just sung this one line when the Fairy exclaimed: “This ballad\nis unlike the ballads written in the dusty world whose purport is to\nhand down remarkable events, in which the distinction of scholars,\ngirls, old men and women, and fools is essential, and in which are\nfurthermore introduced the lyrics of the Southern and Northern Palaces.\nThese fairy songs consist either of elegaic effusions on some person or\nimpressions of some occurrence or other, and are impromptu songs readily\nset to the music of wind or string instruments, so that any one who is\nnot cognisant of their gist cannot appreciate the beauties contained in\nthem. So you are not likely, I fear, to understand this lyric with any\nclearness; and unless you first peruse the text and then listen to the\nballad, you will, instead of pleasure, feel as if you were chewing wax\n(devoid of any zest).”",
        "After these remarks, she turned her head round, and directed a young\nmaid-servant to fetch the text of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which\nshe handed to Pao-yü, who took it over; and as he followed the words\nwith his eyes, with his ears he listened to the strains of this song:",
        "Preface of the Bream of the Red Chamber.–When the Heavens were opened\nand earth was laid out chaos prevailed! What was the germ of love? It\narises entirely from the strength of licentious love.",
        "What day, by the will of heaven, I felt wounded at heart, and what time\nI was at leisure, I made an attempt to disburden my sad heart; and with\nthis object in view I indited this Dream of the Bed Chamber, on the\nsubject of a disconsolate gold trinket and an unfortunate piece of jade.",
        "Waste of a whole Lifetime. All maintain that the match between gold and\njade will be happy. All I can think of is the solemn oath contracted in\ndays gone by by the plant and stone! Vain will I gaze upon the snow,\nHsüeh, [Pao-ch’ai], pure as crystal and lustrous like a gem of the\neminent priest living among the hills! Never will I forget the noiseless\nFairy Grove, Lin [Tai-yü], beyond the confines of the mortal world!\nAlas! now only have I come to believe that human happiness is\nincomplete; and that a couple may be bound by the ties of wedlock for\nlife, but that after all their hearts are not easy to lull into\ncontentment.",
        "Vain knitting of the brows. The one is a spirit flower of Fairyland; the\nother is a beautiful jade without a blemish. Do you maintain that their\nunion will not be remarkable? Why how then is it that he has come to\nmeet her again in this existence? If the union will you say, be strange,\nhow is it then that their love affair will be but empty words? The one\nin her loneliness will give way to useless sighs. The other in vain will\nyearn and crave. The one will be like the reflection of the moon in\nwater; the other like a flower reflected in a mirror. Consider, how many\ndrops of tears can there be in the eyes? and how could they continue to\ndrop from autumn to winter and from spring to flow till summer time?",
        "But to come to Pao-yü. After he had heard these ballads, so diffuse and\nvague, he failed to see any point of beauty in them; but the plaintive\nmelody of the sound was nevertheless sufficient to drive away his spirit\nand exhilarate his soul. Hence it was that he did not make any inquiries\nabout the arguments, and that he did not ask about the matter treated,\nbut simply making these ballads the means for the time being of\ndispelling melancholy, he therefore went on with the perusal of what\ncame below.\n\r\nDespicable Spirit of Death! You will be rejoicing that glory is at its\nheight when hateful death will come once again, and with eyes wide with\nhorror, you will discard all things, and dimly and softly the fragrant\nspirit will waste and dissolve! You will yearn for native home, but\ndistant will be the way, and lofty the mountains. Hence it is that you\nwill betake yourself in search of father and mother, while they lie\nunder the influence of a dream, and hold discourse with them. “Your\nchild,” you will say, “has already trodden the path of death! Oh my\nparents, it behoves you to speedily retrace your steps and make good\nyour escape!”",
        "Separated from Relatives. You will speed on a journey of three thousand\nli at the mercy of wind and rain, and tear yourself from all your family\nties and your native home! Your fears will be lest anguish should do any\nharm to your parents in their failing years! “Father and mother,” you\nwill bid them, “do not think with any anxiety of your child. From ages\npast poverty as well as success have both had a fixed destiny; and is it\nlikely that separation and reunion are not subject to predestination?\nThough we may now be far apart in two different places, we must each of\nus try and preserve good cheer. Your abject child has, it is true, gone\nfrom home, but abstain from distressing yourselves on her account!”",
        "Sorrow in the midst of Joy. While wrapped as yet in swaddling clothes,\nfather and mother, both alas! will depart, and dwell though you will in\nthat mass of gauze, who is there who will know how to spoil you with any\nfond attention? Born you will be fortunately with ample moral courage,\nand high-minded and boundless resources, for your parents will not have,\nin the least, their child’s secret feelings at heart! You will be like a\nmoon appearing to view when the rain holds up, shedding its rays upon\nthe Jade Hall; or a gentle breeze (wafting its breath upon it). Wedded\nto a husband, fairy like fair and accomplished, you will enjoy a\nhappiness enduring as the earth and perennial as the Heavens! and you\nwill be the means of snapping asunder the bitter fate of your youth!\nBut, after all, the clouds will scatter in Kao T’ang and the waters of\nthe Hsiang river will get parched! This is the inevitable destiny of\ndissolution and continuance which prevails in the mortal world, and what\nneed is there to indulge in useless grief?",
        "Intolerable to the world. Your figure will be as winsome as an olea\nfragrans; your talents as ample as those of a Fairy! You will by nature\nbe so haughty that of the whole human race few will be like you! You\nwill look upon a meat diet as one of dirt, and treat splendour as coarse\nand loathsome! And yet you will not be aware that your high notions will\nbring upon you the excessive hatred of man! You will be very eager in\nyour desire after chastity, but the human race will despise you! Alas,\nyou will wax old in that antique temple hall under a faint light, where\nyou will waste ungrateful for beauty, looks and freshness! But after all\nyou will still be worldly, corrupt and unmindful of your vows; just like\na spotless white jade you will be whose fate is to fall into the mire!\nAnd what need will there be for the grandson of a prince or the son of a\nduke to deplore that his will not be the good fortune (of winning your\naffections)?",
        "The Voluptuary. You will resemble a wolf in the mountains! a savage\nbeast devoid of all human feeling! Regardless in every way of the\nobligations of days gone by, your sole pleasure will be in the\nindulgence of haughtiness, extravagance, licentiousness and dissolute\nhabits! You will be inordinate in your conjugal affections, and look\ndown upon the beautiful charms of the child of a marquis, as if they\nwere cat-tail rush or willow; trampling upon the honourable daughter of\na ducal mansion, as if she were one of the common herd. Pitiful to say,\nthe fragrant spirit and beauteous ghost will in a year softly and gently\npass away!",
        "The Perception that all things are transient like flowers. You will look\nlightly upon the three springs and regard the blush of the peach and the\ngreen of the willow as of no avail. You will beat out the fire of\nsplendour, and treat solitary retirement as genial! What is it that you\nsay about the delicate peaches in the heavens (marriage) being\nexcellent, and the petals of the almond in the clouds being plentiful\n(children)? Let him who has after all seen one of them, (really a mortal\nbeing) go safely through the autumn, (wade safely through old age),\nbehold the people in the white Poplar village groan and sigh; and the\nspirits under the green maple whine and moan! Still more wide in expanse\nthan even the heavens is the dead vegetation which covers the graves!\nThe moral is this, that the burden of man is poverty one day and\naffluence another; that bloom in spring, and decay in autumn, constitute\nthe doom of vegetable life! In the same way, this calamity of birth and\nthe visitation of death, who is able to escape? But I have heard it said\nthat there grows in the western quarter a tree called the P’o So\n(Patient Bearing) which bears the fruit of Immortal life!",
        "The bane of Intelligence. Yours will be the power to estimate, in a\nthorough manner, the real motives of all things, as yours will be\nintelligence of an excessive degree; but instead (of reaping any\nbenefit) you will cast the die of your own existence! The heart of your\nprevious life is already reduced to atoms, and when you shall have died,\nyour nature will have been intelligent to no purpose! Your home will be\nin easy circumstances; your family will enjoy comforts; but your\nconnexions will, at length, fall a prey to death, and the inmates of\nyour family scatter, each one of you speeding in a different direction,\nmaking room for others! In vain, you will have harassed your mind with\ncankering thoughts for half a lifetime; for it will be just as if you\nhad gone through the confused mazes of a dream on the third watch!\nSudden a crash (will be heard) like the fall of a spacious palace, and a\ndusky gloominess (will supervene) such as is caused by a lamp about to\nspend itself! Alas! a spell of happiness will be suddenly (dispelled by)\nadversity! Woe is man in the world! for his ultimate doom is difficult\nto determine!",

Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother, will have\nlaid by a store of virtue and secret meritorious actions! My advice to\nyou, mankind, is to relieve the destitute and succour the distressed! Do\nnot resemble those who will harp after lucre and show themselves\nunmindful of the ties of relationship: that wolflike maternal uncle of\nyours and that impostor of a brother! True it is that addition and\nsubtraction, increase and decrease, (reward and punishment,) rest in the\nhands of Heaven above!",
        "Splendour at last. Loving affection in a mirror will be still more\nephemeral than fame in a dream. That fine splendour will fleet how soon!\nMake no further allusion to embroidered curtain, to bridal coverlet; for\nthough you may come to wear on your head a pearl-laden coronet, and, on\nyour person, a jacket ornamented with phoenixes, yours will not\nnevertheless be the means to atone for the short life (of your husband)!\nThough the saying is that mankind should not have, in their old age, the\nburden of poverty to bear, yet it is also essential that a store of\nbenevolent deeds should be laid up for the benefit of sons and\ngrandsons! (Your son) may come to be dignified in appearance and wear on\nhis head the official tassel, and on his chest may be suspended the gold\nseal resplendent in lustre; he may be imposing in his majesty, and he\nmay rise high in status and emoluments, but the dark and dreary way\nwhich leads to death is short! Are the generals and ministers who have\nbeen from ages of old still in the flesh, forsooth? They exist only in a\nfutile name handed down to posterity to reverence!",
        "Death ensues when things propitious reign! Upon the ornamented beam will\nsettle at the close of spring the fragrant dust! Your reckless\nindulgence of licentious love and your naturally moonlike face will soon\nbe the source of the ruin of a family. The decadence of the family\nestate will emanate entirely from Ching; while the wane of the family\naffairs will be entirely attributable to the fault of Ning! Licentious\nlove will be the main reason of the long-standing grudge.",
        "The flying birds each perch upon the trees! The family estates of those\nin official positions will fade! The gold and silver of the rich and\nhonoured will be scattered! those who will have conferred benefit will,\neven in death, find the means of escape! those devoid of human feelings\nwill reap manifest retribution! Those indebted for a life will make, in\ndue time, payment with their lives; those indebted for tears have\nalready (gone) to exhaust their tears!

You wish to know why your life will be short; look\ninto your previous existence! Verily, riches and honours, which will\ncome with old age, will likewise be a question of chance! Those who will\nhold the world in light esteem will retire within the gate of\nabstraction; while those who will be allured by enticement will have\nforfeited their lives (The Chia family will fulfil its destiny) as\nsurely as birds take to the trees after they have exhausted all they had\nto eat, and which as they drop down will pile up a hoary, vast and lofty\nheap of dust, (leaving) indeed a void behind!",
        "When the maidens had finished the ballads, they went on to sing the\n\"Supplementary Record;” but the Monitory Vision Fairy, perceiving the\ntotal absence of any interest in Pao-yü, heaved a sigh. “You silly\nbrat!” she exclaimed. “What! haven’t you, even now, attained\nperception!”",
        "“There’s no need for you to go on singing,” speedily observed Pao-yü, as\nhe interrupted the singing maidens; and feeling drowsy and dull, he\npleaded being under the effects of wine, and begged to be allowed to lie\ndown.",
        "The Fairy then gave orders to clear away the remains of the feast, and\nescorted Pao-yü to a suite of female apartments, where the splendour of\nsuch objects as were laid out was a thing which he had not hitherto\nseen. But what evoked in him wonder still more intense, was the sight,\nat an early period, of a girl seated in the room, who, in the freshness\nof her beauty and winsomeness of her charms, bore some resemblance to\nPao-ch’ai, while, in elegance and comeliness, on the other hand, to\nTai-yu.",
        "While he was plunged in a state of perplexity, the Fairy suddenly\nremarked: “All those female apartments and ladies’ chambers in so many\nwealthy and honourable families in the world are, without exception,\npolluted by voluptuous opulent puppets and by all that bevy of\nprofligate girls. But still more despicable are those from old till now\nnumberless dissolute roués, one and all of whom maintain that libidinous\naffections do not constitute lewdness; and who try, further, to prove\nthat licentious love is not tantamount to lewdness. But all these\narguments are mere apologies for their shortcomings, and a screen for\ntheir pollutions; for if libidinous affection be lewdness, still more\ndoes the perception of licentious love constitute lewdness. Hence it is\nthat the indulgence of sensuality and the gratification of licentious\naffection originate entirely from a relish of lust, as well as from a\nhankering after licentious love. Lo you, who are the object of my love,\nare the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to the\npresent time!”",
        "Pao-yü was quite dumbstruck by what he heard, and hastily smiling, he\nsaid by way of reply: “My Fairy labours under a misapprehension. Simply\nbecause of my reluctance to read my books my parents have, on repeated\noccasions, extended to me injunction and reprimand, and would I have the\ncourage to go so far as to rashly plunge in lewd habits? Besides, I am\nstill young in years, and have no notion what is implied by lewdness!”",
        "“Not so!” exclaimed the Fairy; “lewdness, although one thing in\nprinciple is, as far as meaning goes, subject to different\nconstructions; as is exemplified by those in the world whose heart is\nset upon lewdness. Some delight solely in faces and figures; others find\ninsatiable pleasure in singing and dancing; some in dalliance and\nraillery; others in the incessant indulgence of their lusts; and these\nregret that all the beautiful maidens under the heavens cannot minister\nto their short-lived pleasure. These several kinds of persons are foul\nobjects steeped skin and all in lewdness. The lustful love, for\ninstance, which has sprung to life and taken root in your natural\naffections, I and such as myself extend to it the character of an\nabstract lewdness; but abstract lewdness can be grasped by the mind, but\ncannot be transmitted by the mouth; can be fathomed by the spirit, but\ncannot be divulged in words. As you now are imbued with this desire only\nin the abstract, you are certainly well fit to be a trustworthy friend\nin (Fairyland) inner apartments, but, on the path of the mortal world,\nyou will inevitably be misconstrued and defamed; every mouth will\nridicule you; every eye will look down upon you with contempt. After\nmeeting recently your worthy ancestors, the two Dukes of Ning and Jung,\nwho opened their hearts and made their wishes known to me with such\nfervour, (but I will not have you solely on account of the splendour of\nour inner apartments look down despisingly upon the path of the world),\nI consequently led you along, my son, and inebriated you with luscious\nwines, steeped you in spiritual tea, and admonished you with excellent\nsongs, bringing also here a young sister of mine, whose infant name is\nChien Mei, and her style K’o Ching, to be given to you as your wedded\nwife. To-night, the time will be propitious and suitable for the\nimmediate consummation of the union, with the express object of letting\nyou have a certain insight into the fact that if the condition of the\nabode of spirits within the confines of Fairyland be still so\n(imperfect), how much the more so should be the nature of the affections\nwhich prevail in the dusty world; with the intent that from this time\nforth you should positively break loose from bondage, perceive and amend\nyour former disposition, devote your attention to the works of Confucius\nand Mencius, and set your steady purpose upon the principles of\nmorality.”",
        "Having ended these remarks, she initiated him into the mysteries of\nlicentious love, and, pushing Pao-yü into the room, she closed the door,\nand took her departure all alone. Pao-yü in a dazed state complied with\nthe admonitions given him by the Fairy, and the natural result was, of\ncourse, a violent flirtation, the circumstances of which it would be\nimpossible to recount.",
        "When the next day came, he was by that time so attached to her by ties\nof tender love and their conversation was so gentle and full of charm\nthat he could not brook to part from K’o Ching. Hand-in-hand, the two of\nthem therefore, went out for a stroll, when they unexpectedly reached a\nplace, where nothing else met their gaze than thorns and brambles, which\ncovered the ground, and a wolf and a tiger walking side by side. Before\nthem stretched the course of a black stream, which obstructed their\nprogress; and over this stream there was, what is more, no bridge to\nenable one to cross it.",
        "While they were exercising their minds with perplexity, they suddenly\nespied the Fairy coming from the back in pursuit of them. “Desist at\nonce,” she exclaimed, “from making any advance into the stream; it is\nurgent that you should, with all speed, turn your faces round!”",
        "Pao-yü lost no time in standing still. “What is this place?” he\ninquired.",
        "“This is the Ford of Enticement,” explained the Fairy. “Its depth is ten\nthousand chang; its breadth is a thousand li; in its stream there are no\nboats or paddles by means of which to effect a passage. There is simply\na raft, of which Mu Chu-shih directs the rudder, and which Hui Shih chen\npunts with the poles. They receive no compensation in the shape of gold\nor silver, but when they come across any one whose destiny it is to\ncross, they ferry him over. You now have by accident strolled as far as\nhere, and had you fallen into the stream you would have rendered quite\nuseless the advice and admonition which I previously gave you.”",
        "These words were scarcely concluded, when suddenly was heard from the\nmidst of the Ford of Enticement, a sound like unto a peal of thunder,\nwhereupon a whole crowd of gobblins and sea-urchins laid hands upon\nPao-yü and dragged him down.",
        "This so filled Pao-yü with consternation that he fell into a\nperspiration as profuse as rain, and he simultaneously broke forth and\nshouted, “Rescue me, K’o Ching!”",
        "These cries so terrified Hsi Jen and the other waiting-maids, that they\nrushed forward, and taking Pao-yü in their arms, “Don’t be afraid,\nPao-yü,” they said, “we are here.”",
        "But we must observe that Mrs. Ch’in was just inside the apartment in the\nact of recommending the young waiting-maids to be mindful that the cats\nand dogs did not start a fight, when she unawares heard Pao-yü, in his\ndream, call her by her infant name. In a melancholy mood she therefore\ncommuned within herself, “As far as my infant name goes, there is, in\nthis establishment, no one who has any idea what it is, and how is it\nthat he has come to know it, and that he utters it in his dream?” And\nshe was at this period unable to fathom the reason. But, reader, listen\nto the explanations given in the chapter which follows.",
        "  Chia Pao-yü reaps his first experience in licentious love.\n  Old Goody Liu pays a visit to the Jung Kuo Mansion.",
        "Mrs. Ch’in, to resume our narrative, upon hearing Pao-yü call her in his\ndream by her infant name, was at heart very exercised, but she did not\nhowever feel at liberty to make any minute inquiry.",
        "Pao-yü was, at this time, in such a dazed state, as if he had lost\nsomething, and the servants promptly gave him a decoction of lungngan.\nAfter he had taken a few sips, he forthwith rose and tidied his clothes.",
        "Hsi Jen put out her hand to fasten the band of his garment, and as soon\nas she did so, and it came in contact with his person, it felt so icy\ncold to the touch, covered as it was all over with perspiration, that\nshe speedily withdrew her hand in utter surprise.",
        "“What’s the matter with you?” she exclaimed.",
        "A blush suffused Pao-yü’s face, and he took Hsi Jen’s hand in a tight\ngrip. Hsi Jen was a girl with all her wits about her; she was besides a\ncouple of years older than Pao-yü and had recently come to know\nsomething of the world, so that at the sight of his state, she to a\ngreat extent readily accounted for the reason in her heart. From modest\nshame, she unconsciously became purple in the face, and not venturing to\nask another question she continued adjusting his clothes. This task\naccomplished, she followed him over to old lady Chia’s apartments; and\nafter a hurry-scurry meal, they came back to this side, and Hsi Jen\navailed herself of the absence of the nurses and waiting-maids to hand\nPao-yü another garment to change.",
        "“Please, dear Hsi Jen, don’t tell any one,” entreated Pao-yü, with\nconcealed shame.",
        "“What did you dream of?” inquired Hsi Jen, smiling, as she tried to\nstifle her blushes, “and whence comes all this perspiration?”",
        "“It’s a long story,” said Pao-yü, “which only a few words will not\nsuffice to explain.”",
        "He accordingly recounted minutely, for her benefit, the subject of his\ndream. When he came to where the Fairy had explained to him the\nmysteries of love, Hsi Jen was overpowered with modesty and covered her\nface with her hands; and as she bent down, she gave way to a fit of\nlaughter. Pao-yü had always been fond of Hsi Jen, on account of her\ngentleness, pretty looks and graceful and elegant manner, and he\nforthwith expounded to her all the mysteries he had been taught by the\nFairy.",
        "Hsi Jen was, of course, well aware that dowager lady Chia had given her\nover to Pao-yü, so that her present behaviour was likewise no\ntransgression. And subsequently she secretly attempted with Pao-yü a\nviolent flirtation, and lucky enough no one broke in upon them during\ntheir tête-à-tête. From this date, Pao-yü treated Hsi Jen with special\nregard, far more than he showed to the other girls, while Hsi Jen\nherself was still more demonstrative in her attentions to Pao-yü. But\nfor a time we will make no further remark about them.",
        "As regards the household of the Jung mansion, the inmates may, on adding\nup the total number, not have been found many; yet, counting the high as\nwell as the low, there were three hundred persons and more. Their\naffairs may not have been very numerous, still there were, every day,\nten and twenty matters to settle; in fact, the household resembled, in\nevery way, ravelled hemp, devoid even of a clue-end, which could be used\nas an introduction.",
        "Just as we were considering what matter and what person it would be best\nto begin writing of, by a lucky coincidence suddenly from a distance of\na thousand li, a person small and insignificant as a grain of mustard\nseed happened, on account of her distant relationship with the Jung\nfamily, to come on this very day to the Jung mansion on a visit. We\nshall therefore readily commence by speaking of this family, as it after\nall affords an excellent clue for a beginning.",
        "The surname of this mean and humble family was in point of fact Wang.\nThey were natives of this district. Their ancestor had filled a minor\noffice in the capital, and had, in years gone by, been acquainted with\nlady Feng’s grandfather, that is madame Wang’s father. Being covetous of\nthe influence and affluence of the Wang family, he consequently joined\nancestors with them, and was recognised by them as a nephew.",
        "At that time, there were only madame Wang’s eldest brother, that is lady\nFeng’s father, and madame Wang herself, who knew anything of these\ndistant relations, from the fact of having followed their parents to the\ncapital. The rest of the family had one and all no idea about them.",
        "This ancestor had, at this date, been dead long ago, leaving only one\nson called Wang Ch’eng. As the family estate was in a state of ruin, he\nonce more moved outside the city walls and settled down in his native\nvillage. Wang Ch’eng also died soon after his father, leaving a son,\nknown in his infancy as Kou Erh, who married a Miss Liu, by whom he had\na son called by the infant name of Pan Erh, as well as a daughter,\nCh’ing Erh. His family consisted of four, and he earned a living from\nfarming.",
        "As Kou Erh was always busy with something or other during the day and\nhis wife, dame Liu, on the other hand, drew the water, pounded the rice\nand attended to all the other domestic concerns, the brother and sister,\nCh’ing Erh and Pan Erh, the two of them, had no one to look after them.\n(Hence it was that) Kou Erh brought over his mother-in-law, old goody\nLiu, to live with them.",
        "This goody Liu was an old widow, with a good deal of experience. She had\nbesides no son round her knees, so that she was dependent for her\nmaintenance on a couple of acres of poor land, with the result that when\nher son-in-law received her in his home, she naturally was ever willing\nto exert heart and mind to help her daughter and her son-in-law to earn\ntheir living.",
        "This year, the autumn had come to an end, winter had commenced, and the\nweather had begun to be quite cold. No provision had been made in the\nhousehold for the winter months, and Kou Erh was, inevitably,\nexceedingly exercised in his heart. Having had several cups of wine to\ndispel his distress, he sat at home and tried to seize upon every trifle\nto give vent to his displeasure. His wife had not the courage to force\nherself in his way, and hence goody Liu it was who encouraged him, as\nshe could not bear to see the state of the domestic affairs.",
        "“Don’t pull me up for talking too much,” she said; “but who of us\ncountry people isn’t honest and open-hearted? As the size of the bowl we\nhold, so is the quantity of the rice we eat. In your young days, you\nwere dependent on the support of your old father, so that eating and\ndrinking became quite a habit with you; that’s how, at the present time,\nyour resources are quite uncertain; when you had money, you looked\nahead, and didn’t mind behind; and now that you have no money, you\nblindly fly into huffs. A fine fellow and a capital hero you have made!\nLiving though we now be away from the capital, we are after all at the\nfeet of the Emperor; this city of Ch’ang Ngan is strewn all over with\nmoney, but the pity is that there’s no one able to go and fetch it away;\nand it’s no use your staying at home and kicking your feet about.”",
        "“All you old lady know,” rejoined Kou Erh, after he had heard what she\nhad to say, “is to sit on the couch and talk trash! Is it likely you\nwould have me go and play the robber?”",
        "“Who tells you to become a robber?” asked goody Liu. “But it would be\nwell, after all, that we should put our heads together and devise some\nmeans; for otherwise, is the money, pray, able of itself to run into our\nhouse?”",
        "“Had there been a way,” observed Kou Erh, smiling sarcastically, “would\nI have waited up to this moment? I have besides no revenue collectors as\nrelatives, or friends in official positions; and what way could we\ndevise? ’But even had I any, they wouldn’t be likely, I fear, to pay any\nheed to such as ourselves!”",
        "“That, too, doesn’t follow,” remarked goody Liu; “the planning of\naffairs rests with man, but the accomplishment of them rests with\nHeaven. After we have laid our plans, we may, who can say, by relying on\nthe sustenance of the gods, find some favourable occasion. Leave it to\nme, I’ll try and devise some lucky chance for you people! In years gone\nby, you joined ancestors with the Wang family of Chin Ling, and twenty\nyears back, they treated you with consideration; but of late, you’ve\nbeen so high and mighty, and not condescended to go and bow to them,\nthat an estrangement has arisen. I remember how in years gone by, I and\nmy daughter paid them a visit. The second daughter of the family was\nreally so pleasant and knew so well how to treat people with kindness,\nand without in fact any high airs! She’s at present the wife of Mr.\nChia, the second son of the Jung Kuo mansion; and I hear people say that\nnow that she’s advanced in years, she’s still more considerate to the\npoor, regardful of the old, and very fond of preparing vegetable food\nfor the bonzes and performing charitable deeds. The head of the Wang\nmansion has, it is true, been raised to some office on the frontier, but\nI hope that this lady Secunda will anyhow notice us. How is it then that\nyou don’t find your way as far as there; for she may possibly remember\nold times, and some good may, no one can say, come of it? I only wish\nthat she would display some of her kind-heartedness, and pluck one hair\nfrom her person which would be, yea thicker than our waist.”",
        "“What you suggest, mother, is quite correct,” interposed Mrs. Liu, Kou\nErh’s wife, who stood by and took up the conversation, “but with such\nmouth and phiz as yours and mine, how could we present ourselves before\nher door? Why I fear that the man at her gate won’t also like to go and\nannounce us! and we’d better not go and have our mouths slapped in\npublic!”",
        "Kou Erh, who would have thought it, prized highly both affluence and\nfame, so that when he heard these remarks, he forthwith began to feel at\nheart a little more at ease. When he furthermore heard what his wife had\nto say, he at once caught up the word as he smiled.",
        "“Old mother,” he rejoined; “since that be your idea, and what’s more,\nyou have in days gone by seen this lady on one occasion, why shouldn’t\nyou, old lady, start to-morrow on a visit to her and first ascertain how\nthe wind blows!”",
        "“Ai Ya!” exclaimed old Goody, “It may very well be said that the\nmarquis’ door is like the wide ocean! what sort of thing am I? why the\nservants of that family wouldn’t even recognise me! even were I to go,\nit would be on a wild goose chase.”",
        "“No matter about that,” observed Kou Erh; “I’ll tell you a good way; you\njust take along with you, your grandson, little Pan Erh, and go first\nand call upon Chou Jui, who is attached to that household; and when once\nyou’ve seen him, there will be some little chance. This Chou Jui, at one\ntime, was connected with my father in some affair or other, and we were\non excellent terms with him.”",
        "“That I too know,” replied goody Liu, “but the thing is that you’ve had\nno dealings with him for so long, that who knows how he’s disposed\ntowards us now? this would be hard to say. Besides, you’re a man, and\nwith a mouth and phiz like that of yours, you couldn’t, on any account,\ngo on this errand. My daughter is a young woman, and she too couldn’t\nvery well go and expose herself to public gaze. But by my sacrificing\nthis old face of mine, and by going and knocking it (against the wall)\nthere may, after all, be some benefit and all of us might reap profit.”",
        "That very same evening, they laid their plans, and the next morning\nbefore the break of day, old goody Liu speedily got up, and having\nperformed her toilette, she gave a few useful hints to Pan Erh; who,\nbeing a child of five or six years of age, was, when he heard that he\nwas to be taken into the city, at once so delighted that there was\nnothing that he would not agree to.",
        "Without further delay, goody Liu led off Pan Erh, and entered the city,\nand reaching the Ning Jung street, she came to the main entrance of the\nJung mansion, where, next to the marble lions, were to be seen a crowd\nof chairs and horses. Goody Liu could not however muster the courage to\ngo by, but having shaken her clothes, and said a few more seasonable\nwords to Pan Erh, she subsequently squatted in front of the side gate,\nwhence she could see a number of servants, swelling out their chests,\npushing out their stomachs, gesticulating with their hands and kicking\r\ntheir feet about, while they were seated at the main entrance chattering\nabout one thing and another.",
        "Goody Liu felt constrained to edge herself forward. “Gentlemen,” she\nventured, “may happiness betide you!”",
        "The whole company of servants scrutinised her for a time. “Where do you\ncome from?” they at length inquired.",
        "“I’ve come to look up Mr. Chou, an attendant of my lady’s,” remarked\ngoody Liu, as she forced a smile; “which of you, gentlemen, shall I\ntrouble to do me the favour of asking him to come out?”",
        "The servants, after hearing what she had to say, paid, the whole number\nof them, no heed to her; and it was after the lapse of a considerable\ntime that they suggested: “Go and wait at a distance, at the foot of\nthat wall; and in a short while, the visitors, who are in their house,\nwill be coming out.”",
        "Among the party of attendants was an old man, who interposed,",
        "“Don’t baffle her object,” he expostulated; “why make a fool of her?\"\nand turning to goody Liu: “This Mr. Chou,” he said, “is gone south: his\nhouse is at the back row; his wife is anyhow at home; so go round this\nway, until you reach the door, at the back street, where, if you will\nask about her, you will be on the right track.”",
        "Goody Liu, having expressed her thanks, forthwith went, leading Pan Erh\nby the hand, round to the back door, where she saw several pedlars\nresting their burdens. There were also those who sold things to eat, and\nthose who sold playthings and toys; and besides these, twenty or thirty\nboys bawled and shouted, making quite a noise.",
        "Goody Liu readily caught hold of one of them. “I’d like to ask you just\na word, my young friend,” she observed; “there’s a Mrs. Chou here; is\nshe at home?”",
        "“Which Mrs. Chou?” inquired the boy; “we here have three Mrs. Chous; and\nthere are also two young married ladies of the name of Chou. What are\nthe duties of the one you want, I wonder ?”",
        "“She’s a waiting-woman of my lady,” replied goody Liu.",
        "“It’s easy to get at her,” added the boy; “just come along with me.”",
        "Leading the way for goody Liu into the backyard, they reached the wall\nof a court, when he pointed and said, “This is her house.–Mother Chou!\"\nhe went on to shout with alacrity; “there’s an old lady who wants to see\nyou.”",
        "Chou Jui’s wife was at home, and with all haste she came out to greet\nher visitor. “Who is it?” she asked.",
        "Goody Liu advanced up to her. “How are you,” she inquired, “Mrs. Chou?”",
        "Mrs. Chou looked at her for some time before she at length smiled and\nreplied, “Old goody Liu, are you well? How many years is it since we’ve\nseen each other; tell me, for I forget just now; but please come in and\nsit.”",
        "“You’re a lady of rank,” answered goody Liu smiling, as she walked\nalong, “and do forget many things. How could you remember such as\nourselves?”",
        "With these words still in her mouth, they had entered the house,\nwhereupon Mrs. Chou ordered a hired waiting-maid to pour the tea. While\nthey were having their tea she remarked, “How Pan Erh has managed to\ngrow!” and then went on to make inquiries on the subject of various\nmatters, which had occurred after their separation.",
        "“To-day,” she also asked of goody Liu, “were you simply passing by? or\ndid you come with any express object?”",
        "“I’ve come, the fact is, with an object!” promptly replied goody Liu;\n\"(first of all) to see you, my dear sister-in-law; and, in the second\nplace also, to inquire after my lady’s health. If you could introduce me\nto see her for a while, it would be better; but if you can’t, I must\nreadily borrow your good offices, my sister-in-law, to convey my\nmessage.”",
        "Mr. Chou Jui’s wife, after listening to these words, at once became to a\ngreat extent aware of the object of her visit. Her husband had, however,\nin years gone by in his attempt to purchase some land, obtained\nconsiderably the support of Kou Erh, so that when she, on this occasion,\nsaw goody Liu in such a dilemma, she could not make up her mind to\nrefuse her wish. Being in the second place keen upon making a display of\nher own respectability, she therefore said smilingly:",
        "“Old goody Liu, pray compose your mind! You’ve come from far off with a\npure heart and honest purpose, and how can I ever not show you the way\nhow to see this living Buddha? Properly speaking, when people come and\nguests arrive, and verbal messages have to be given, these matters are\nnot any of my business, as we all here have each one kind of duties to\ncarry out. My husband has the special charge of the rents of land coming\nin, during the two seasons of spring and autumn, and when at leisure, he\ntakes the young gentlemen out of doors, and then his business is done.\nAs for myself, I have to accompany my lady and young married ladies on\nanything connected with out-of-doors; but as you are a relative of my\nlady and have besides treated me as a high person and come to me for\nhelp, I’ll, after all, break this custom and deliver your message.\nThere’s only one thing, however, and which you, old lady, don’t know. We\nhere are not what we were five years before. My lady now doesn’t much\nworry herself about anything; and it’s entirely lady Secunda who looks\nafter the menage. But who do you presume is this lady Secunda? She’s the\nniece of my lady, and the daughter of my master, the eldest maternal\nuncle of by-gone days. Her infant name was Feng Ko.”",
        "“Is it really she?” inquired promptly goody Liu, after this explanation.\n\"Isn’t it strange? what I said about her years back has come out quite\ncorrect; but from all you say, shall I to-day be able to see her?”",
        "“That goes without saying,” replied Chou Jui’s wife; “when any visitors\ncome now-a-days, it’s always lady Feng who does the honours and\nentertains them, and it’s better to-day that you should see her for a\nwhile, for then you will not have walked all this way to no purpose.”",
        "“O mi to fu!” exclaimed old goody Liu; “I leave it entirely to your\nconvenience, sister-in-law.”",
        "“What’s that you’re saying?” observed Chou Jui’s wife. “The proverb\nsays: ’Our convenience is the convenience of others.’ All I have to do\nis to just utter one word, and what trouble will that be to me.”",
        "Saying this, she bade the young waiting maid go to the side pavilion,\nand quietly ascertain whether, in her old ladyship’s apartment, table\nhad been laid.",
        "The young waiting-maid went on this errand, and during this while, the\ntwo of them continued a conversation on certain irrelevant matters.",
        "“This lady Feng,” observed goody Liu, “can this year be no older than\ntwenty, and yet so talented as to manage such a household as this! the\nlike of her is not easy to find!”",
        "“Hai! my dear old goody,” said Chou Jui’s wife, after listening to her,\n\"it’s not easy to explain; but this lady Feng, though young in years, is\nnevertheless, in the management of affairs, superior to any man. She has\nnow excelled the others and developed the very features of a beautiful\nyoung woman. To say the least, she has ten thousand eyes in her heart,\nand were they willing to wager their mouths, why ten men gifted with\neloquence couldn’t even outdo her! But by and bye, when you’ve seen her,\nyou’ll know all about her! There’s only this thing, she can’t help being\nrather too severe in her treatment of those below her.”",
        "While yet she spake, the young waiting-maid returned. “In her venerable\nlady’s apartment,” she reported, “repast has been spread, and already\nfinished; lady Secunda is in madame Wang’s chamber.”",
        "As soon as Chou Jui’s wife heard this news, she speedily got up and\npressed goody Liu to be off at once. “This is,” she urged, “just the\nhour for her meal, and as she is free we had better first go and wait\nfor her; for were we to be even one step too late, a crowd of servants\nwill come with their reports, and it will then be difficult to speak to\nher; and after her siesta, she’ll have still less time to herself.”",
        "As she passed these remarks, they all descended the couch together.\nGoody Liu adjusted their dresses, and, having impressed a few more words\nof advice on Pan Erh, they followed Chou Jui’s wife through winding\npassages to Chia Lien’s house. They came in the first instance into the\nside pavilion, where Chou Jui’s wife placed old goody Liu to wait a\nlittle, while she herself went ahead, past the screen-wall and into the\nentrance of the court.",
        "Hearing that lady Feng had not come out, she went in search of an\nelderly waiting-maid of lady Feng, P’ing Erh by name, who enjoyed her\nconfidence, to whom Chou Jui’s wife first recounted from beginning to\nend the history of old goody Liu.",
        "“She has come to-day,” she went on to explain, “from a distance to pay\nher obeisance. In days gone by, our lady used often to meet her, so\nthat, on this occasion, she can’t but receive her; and this is why I’ve\nbrought her in! I’ll wait here for lady Feng to come down, and explain\neverything to her; and I trust she’ll not call me to task for officious\nrudeness.”",
        "P’ing Erh, after hearing what she had to say, speedily devised the plan\nof asking them to walk in, and to sit there pending (lady Feng’s\narrival), when all would be right.",
        "Chou Jui’s wife thereupon went out and led them in. When they ascended\nthe steps of the main apartment, a young waiting-maid raised a red\nwoollen portière, and as soon as they entered the hall, they smelt a\nwhiff of perfume as it came wafted into their faces: what the scent was\nthey could not discriminate; but their persons felt as if they were\namong the clouds.",
        "The articles of furniture and ornaments in the whole room were all so\nbrilliant to the sight, and so vying in splendour that they made the\nhead to swim and the eyes to blink, and old goody Liu did nothing else\nthe while than nod her head, smack her lips and invoke Buddha. Forthwith\nshe was led to the eastern side into the suite of apartments, where was\nthe bedroom of Chia Lien’s eldest daughter. P’ing Erh, who was standing\nby the edge of the stove-couch, cast a couple of glances at old goody\nLiu, and felt constrained to inquire how she was, and to press her to\nhave a seat.",
        "Goody Liu, noticing that P’ing Erh was entirely robed in silks, that she\nhad gold pins fixed in her hair, and silver ornaments in her coiffure,\nand that her countenance resembled a flower or the moon (in beauty),\nreadily imagined her to be lady Feng, and was about to address her as my\nlady; but when she heard Mrs. Chou speak to her as Miss P’ing, and P’ing\nErh promptly address Chou Jui’s wife as Mrs. Chou, she eventually became\naware that she could be no more than a waiting-maid of a certain\nrespectability.",
        "She at once pressed old goody Liu and Pan Erh to take a seat on the\nstove-couch. P’ing Erh and Chou Jui’s wife sat face to face, on the\nedges of the couch. The waiting-maids brought the tea. After they had\npartaken of it, old goody Liu could hear nothing but a “lo tang, lo\ntang” noise, resembling very much the sound of a bolting frame winnowing\nflour, and she could not resist looking now to the East, and now to the\nWest. Suddenly in the great Hall, she espied, suspended on a pillar, a\nbox at the bottom of which hung something like the weight of a balance,\nwhich incessantly wagged to and fro.",
        "“What can this thing be?” communed goody Liu in her heart, “What can be\nits use?” While she was aghast, she unexpectedly heard a sound of “tang\"\nlike the sound of a golden bell or copper cymbal, which gave her quite a\nstart. In a twinkle of the eyes followed eight or nine consecutive\nstrokes; and she was bent upon inquiring what it was, when she caught\nsight of several waiting-maids enter in a confused crowd. “Our lady has\ncome down!” they announced.",
        "P’ìng Erh, together with Chou Jui’s wife, rose with all haste. “Old\ngoody Liu,” they urged, “do sit down and wait till it’s time, when we’ll\ncome and ask you in.”",
        "Saying this, they went out to meet lady Feng.",
        "Old goody Liu, with suppressed voice and ear intent, waited in perfect\nsilence. She heard at a distance the voices of some people laughing,\nwhereupon about ten or twenty women, with rustling clothes and\npetticoats, made their entrance, one by one, into the hall, and thence\ninto the room on the other quarter. She also detected two or three\nwomen, with red-lacquered boxes in their hands, come over on this part\nand remain in waiting.",
        "“Get the repast ready!” she heard some one from the offside say.",
        "The servants gradually dispersed and went out; and there only remained\nin attendance a few of them to bring in the courses. For a long time,\nnot so much as the caw of a crow could be heard, when she unexpectedly\nperceived two servants carry in a couch-table, and lay it on this side\nof the divan. Upon this table were placed bowls and plates, in proper\norder replete, as usual, with fish and meats; but of these only a few\nkinds were slightly touched.",
        "As soon as Pan Erh perceived (all these delicacies), he set up such a\nnoise, and would have some meat to eat, but goody Liu administered to\nhim such a slap, that he had to keep away.",
        "Suddenly, she saw Mrs. Chou approach, full of smiles, and as she waved\nher hand, she called her. Goody Liu understood her meaning, and at once\npulling Pan Erh off the couch, she proceeded to the centre of the Hall;\nand after Mrs. Chou had whispered to her again for a while, they came at\nlength with slow step into the room on this side, where they saw on the\noutside of the door, suspended by brass hooks, a deep red flowered soft\nportière. Below the window, on the southern side, was a stove-couch, and\non this couch was spread a crimson carpet. Leaning against the wooden\npartition wall, on the east side, stood a chain-embroidered back-cushion\nand a reclining pillow. There was also spread a large watered satin\nsitting cushion with a gold embroidered centre, and on the side stood\ncuspidores made of silver.",
        "Lady Feng, when at home, usually wore on her head a front-piece of dark\nmartin à la Chao Chün, surrounded with tassels of strung pearls. She had\non a robe of peach-red flowered satin, a short pelisse of slate-blue\nstiff silk, lined with squirrel, and a jupe of deep red foreign crepe,\nlined with ermine. Resplendent with pearl-powder and with cosmetics, she\nsat in there, stately and majestic, with a small brass poker in her\nhands, with which she was stirring the ashes of the hand-stove. P’ing\nErh stood by the side of the couch, holding a very small lacquered\ntea-tray. In this tray was a small tea-cup with a cover. Lady Feng\nneither took any tea, nor did she raise her head, but was intent upon\nstirring the ashes of the hand-stove.",
        "“How is it you haven’t yet asked her to come in?” she slowly inquired;\nand as she spake, she turned herself round and was about to ask for some\ntea, when she perceived that Mrs. Chou had already introduced the two\npersons and that they were standing in front of her.",
        "She forthwith pretended to rise, but did not actually get up, and with a\nface radiant with smiles, she ascertained about their health, after\nwhich she went in to chide Chou Jui’s wife. “Why didn’t you tell me they\nhad come before?” she said.",
        "Old goody Liu was already by this time prostrated on the ground, and\nafter making several obeisances, “How are you, my lady?” she inquired.",
        "“Dear Mrs. Chou,” lady Feng immediately observed, “do pull her up, and\ndon’t let her prostrate herself! I’m yet young in years and don’t know\nher much; what’s more, I’ve no idea what’s the degree of the\nrelationship between us, and I daren’t speak directly to her.”",
        "“This is the old lady about whom I spoke a short while back,” speedily\nexplained Mrs. Chou.",
        "Lady Feng nodded her head assentingly.",
        "By this time old goody Liu had taken a seat on the edge of the\nstove-couch. As for Pan Erh, he had gone further, and taken refuge\nbehind her back; and though she tried, by every means, to coax him to\ncome forward and make a bow, he would not, for the life of him, consent.",
        "“Relatives though we be,” remarked lady Feng, as she smiled, “we haven’t\nseen much of each other, so that our relations have been quite distant.\nBut those who know how matters stand will assert that you all despise\nus, and won’t often come to look us up; while those mean people, who\ndon’t know the truth, will imagine that we have no eyes to look at any\none.”",
        "Old goody Liu promptly invoked Buddha. “We are at home in great\nstraits,” she pleaded, “and that’s why it wasn’t easy for us to manage\nto get away and come! Even supposing we had come as far as this, had we\nnot given your ladyship a slap on the mouth, those gentlemen would also,\nin point of fact, have looked down upon us as a mean lot.”",
        "“Why, language such as this,” exclaimed lady Feng smilingly, “cannot\nhelp making one’s heart full of displeasure! We simply rely upon the\nreputation of our grandfather to maintain the status of a penniless\nofficial; that’s all! Why, in whose household is there anything\nsubstantial? we are merely the denuded skeleton of what we were in days\nof old, and no more! As the proverb has it: The Emperor himself has\nthree families of poverty-stricken relatives; and how much more such as\nyou and I?”",
        "Having passed these remarks, she inquired of Mrs. Chou, “Have you let\nmadame know, yes or no?”",
        "“We are now waiting,” replied Mrs. Chou, “for my lady’s orders.”",
        "“Go and have a look,” said lady Feng; “but, should there be any one\nthere, or should she be busy, then don’t make any mention; but wait\nuntil she’s free, when you can tell her about it and see what she says.”",
        "Chou Jui’s wife, having expressed her compliance, went off on this\nerrand. During her absence, lady Feng gave orders to some servants to\ntake a few fruits and hand them to Pan Erh to eat; and she was inquiring\nabout one thing and another, when there came a large number of married\nwomen, who had the direction of affairs in the household, to make their\nseveral reports.",
        "P’ing Erh announced their arrival to lady Feng, who said: “I’m now\nengaged in entertaining some guests, so let them come back again in the\nevening; but should there be anything pressing then bring it in and I’ll\nsettle it at once.”",
        "P’ing Erh left the room, but she returned in a short while. “I’ve asked\nthem,” she observed, “but as there’s nothing of any urgency, I told them\nto disperse.” Lady Feng nodded her head in token of approval, when she\nperceived Chou Jui’s wife come back. “Our lady,” she reported, as she\naddressed lady Feng, “says that she has no leisure to-day, that if you,\nlady Secunda, will entertain them, it will come to the same thing; that\nshe’s much obliged for their kind attention in going to the trouble of\ncoming; that if they have come simply on a stroll, then well and good,\nbut that if they have aught to say, they should tell you, lady Secunda,\nwhich will be tantamount to their telling her.”",
        "“I’ve nothing to say,” interposed old goody Liu. “I simply come to see\nour elder and our younger lady, which is a duty on my part, a relative\nas I am.”",
        "“Well, if there’s nothing particular that you’ve got to say, all right,\"\nMrs. Chou forthwith added, “but if you do have anything, don’t hesitate\ntelling lady Secunda, and it will be just as if you had told our lady.”",
        "As she uttered these words, she winked at goody Liu. Goody Liu\nunderstood what she meant, but before she could give vent to a word, her\nface got scarlet, and though she would have liked not to make any\nmention of the object of her visit, she felt constrained to suppress her\nshame and to speak out.",
        "“Properly speaking,” she observed, “this being the first time I see you,\nmy lady, I shouldn’t mention what I’ve to say, but as I come here from\nfar off to seek your assistance, my old friend, I have no help but to\nmention it.”",
        "She had barely spoken as much as this, when she heard the youths at the\ninner-door cry out: “The young gentleman from the Eastern Mansion has\ncome.”",
        "Lady Feng promptly interrupted her. “Old goody Liu,” she remarked, “you\nneedn’t add anything more.” She, at the same time, inquired, “Where’s\nyour master, Mr. Jung?” when became audible the sound of footsteps along\nthe way, and in walked a young man of seventeen or eighteen. His\nappearance was handsome, his person slender and graceful. He had on\nlight furs, a girdle of value, costly clothes and a beautiful cap.",
        "At this stage, goody Liu did not know whether it was best to sit down or\nto stand up, neither could she find anywhere to hide herself.",
        "“Pray sit down,” urged lady Feng, with a laugh; “this is my nephew!’ Old\ngoody Liu then wriggled herself, now one way, and then another, on to\nthe edge of the couch, where she took a seat.",
        "“My father,” Chia Jung smilingly ventured, “has sent me to ask a favour\nof you, aunt. On some previous occasion, our grand aunt gave you, dear\naunt, a stove-couch glass screen, and as to-morrow father has invited\nsome guests of high standing, he wishes to borrow it to lay it out for a\nlittle show; after which he purposes sending it back again.”",
        "“You’re late by a day,” replied lady Feng. “It was only yesterday that I\ngave it to some one.”",
        "Chia Jung, upon hearing this, forthwith, with giggles and smiles, made,\nnear the edge of the couch, a sort of genuflexion. “Aunt,” he went on,\n\"if you don’t lend it, father will again say that I don’t know how to\nspeak, and I shall get another sound thrashing. You must have pity upon\nyour nephew, aunt.”",
        "“I’ve never seen anything like this,” observed lady Feng sneeringly;\n\"the things belonging to the Wang family are all good, but where have\nyou put all those things of yours? the only good way is that you\nshouldn’t see anything of ours, for as soon as you catch sight of\nanything, you at once entertain a wish to carry it off.”",
        "“Pray, aunt,” entreated Chia Jung with a smile, “do show me some\ncompassion.”",
        "“Mind your skin!” lady Feng warned him, “if you do chip or spoil it in\nthe least.”",
        "She then bade P’ing Erh take the keys of the door of the upstairs room\nand send for several trustworthy persons to carry it away.",
        "Chia Jung was so elated that his eyebrows dilated and his eyes smiled.\n\"I’ve brought myself,” he added, with vehemence, “some men to take it\naway; I won’t let them recklessly bump it about.”",
        "Saying this, he speedily got up and left the room.",
        "Lady Feng suddenly bethought herself of something, and turning towards\nthe window, she called out, “Jung Erh, come back.” Several servants who\nstood outside caught up her words: “Mr. Jung,” they cried, “you’re\nrequested to go back;” whereupon Chia Jung turned round and retraced his\nsteps; and with hands drooping respectfully against his sides, he stood\nready to listen to his aunt’s wishes.",
        "Lady Feng was however intent upon gently sipping her tea, and after a\ngood long while of abstraction, she at last smiled: “Never mind,” she\nremarked; “you can go. But come after you’ve had your evening meal, and\nI’ll then tell you about it. Just now there are visitors here; and\nbesides, I don’t feel in the humour.”",
        "Chia Jung thereupon retired with gentle step.",
        "Old goody Liu, by this time, felt more composed in body and heart. “I’ve\nto-day brought your nephew,” she then explained, “not for anything else,\nbut because his father and mother haven’t at home so much as anything to\neat; the weather besides is already cold, so that I had no help but to\ntake your nephew along and come to you, old friend, for assistance!”",
        "As she uttered these words, she again pushed Pan Erh forward. “What did\nyour father at home tell you to say?” she asked of him; “and what did he\nsend us over here to do? Was it only to give our minds to eating fruit?”",
        "Lady Feng had long ago understood what she meant to convey, and finding\nthat she had no idea how to express herself in a decent manner, she\nreadily interrupted her with a smile. “You needn’t mention anything,\"\nshe observed, “I’m well aware of how things stand;” and addressing\nherself to Mrs. Chou, she inquired, “Has this old lady had breakfast,\nyes or no?”",
        "Old goody Liu hurried to explain. “As soon as it was daylight,” she\nproceeded, “we started with all speed on our way here, and had we even\nso much as time to have any breakfast?”",
        "Lady Feng promptly gave orders to send for something to eat. In a short\nwhile Chou Jui’s wife had called for a table of viands for the guests,\nwhich was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to take\ngoody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast.",
        "“My dear Mrs. Chou,” enjoined lady Feng, “give them all they want, as I\ncan’t attend to them myself;” which said, they hastily passed over into\nthe room on the eastern side.",
        "Lady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: “When you first\ninformed madame about them, what did she say?” “Our Lady observed,\"\nreplied Chou Jui’s wife, “that they don’t really belong to the same\nfamily; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at the\nsame place as our old master; that hence it came that they joined\nancestors; that these few years there hasn’t been much intercourse\n(between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever they\ncame on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and that\nas their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention on\ntheir part, they shouldn’t be slighted. If they’ve anything to say,\"\n(our lady continued), “tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and that\nwill be right.”",
        "“Isn’t it strange!” exclaimed lady Feng, as soon as she had heard the\nmessage; “since we are all one family, how is it I’m not familiar even\nwith so much as their shadow?”",
        "While she was uttering these words, old goody Liu had had her repast and\ncome over, dragging Pan Erh; and, licking her lips and smacking her\nmouth, she expressed her thanks.",
        "Lady Feng smiled. “Do pray sit down,” she said, “and listen to what I’m\ngoing to tell you. What you, old lady, meant a little while back to\nconvey, I’m already as much as yourself well acquainted with! Relatives,\nas we are, we shouldn’t in fact have waited until you came to the\nthreshold of our doors, but ought, as is but right, to have attended to\nyour needs. But the thing is that, of late, the household affairs are\nexceedingly numerous, and our lady, advanced in years as she is,\ncouldn’t at a moment, it may possibly be, bethink herself of you all!\nWhat’s more, when I took over charge of the management of the menage, I\nmyself didn’t know of all these family connections! Besides, though to\nlook at us from outside everything has a grand and splendid aspect,\npeople aren’t aware that large establishments have such great hardships,\nwhich, were we to recount to others, they would hardly like to credit as\ntrue. But since you’ve now come from a great distance, and this is the\nfirst occasion that you open your mouth to address me, how can I very\nwell allow you to return to your home with empty hands! By a lucky\ncoincidence our lady gave, yesterday, to the waiting-maids, twenty taels\nto make clothes with, a sum which they haven’t as yet touched, and if\nyou don’t despise it as too little, you may take it home as a first\ninstalment, and employ it for your wants.”",
        "When old goody Liu heard the mention made by lady Feng of their\nhardships, she imagined that there was no hope; but upon hearing her\nagain speak of giving her twenty taels, she was exceedingly delighted,\nso much so that her eyebrows dilated and her eyes gleamed with smiles.",
        "“We too know,” she smilingly remarked, “all about difficulties! but the\nproverb says, ’A camel dying of leanness is even bigger by much than a\nhorse!’ No matter what those distresses may be, were you yet to pluck\none single hair from your body, my old friend, it would be stouter than\nour own waist.”",
        "Chou Jui’s wife stood by, and on hearing her make these coarse\nutterances, she did all she could to give her a hint by winking, and\nmake her desist. Lady Feng laughed and paid no heed; but calling P’ing\nErh, she bade her fetch the parcel of money, which had been given to\nthem the previous day, and to also bring a string of cash; and when\nthese had been placed before goody Liu’s eyes: “This is,” said lady\nFeng, “silver to the amount of twenty taels, which was for the time\ngiven to these young girls to make winter clothes with; but some other\nday, when you’ve nothing to do, come again on a stroll, in evidence of\nthe good feeling which should exist between relatives. It’s besides\nalready late, and I don’t wish to detain you longer and all for no\npurpose; but, on your return home, present my compliments to all those\nof yours to whom I should send them.”",
        "As she spake, she stood up. Old goody Liu gave utterance to a thousand\nand ten thousand expressions of gratitude, and taking the silver and\ncash, she followed Chou Jui’s wife on her way to the out-houses. “Well,\nmother dear,” inquired Mrs. Chou, “what did you think of my lady that\nyou couldn’t speak; and that whenever you opened your mouth it was all\n’your nephew.’ I’ll make just one remark, and I don’t mind if you do get\nangry. Had he even been your kindred nephew, you should in fact have\nbeen somewhat milder in your language; for that gentleman, Mr. Jung, is\nher kith and kin nephew, and whence has appeared such another nephew of\nhers (as Pan Erh)?”",
        "Old goody Liu smiled. “My dear sister-in-law,” she replied, “as I gazed\nupon her, were my heart and eyes, pray, full of admiration or not? and\nhow then could I speak as I should?”",
        "As they were chatting, they reached Chou Jui’s house. They had been\nsitting for a while, when old goody Liu produced a piece of silver,\nwhich she was purposing to leave behind, to be given to the young\nservants in Chou Jui’s house to purchase fruit to eat; but how could\nMrs. Chou satiate her eye with such a small piece of silver? She was\ndetermined in her refusal to accept it, so that old goody Liu, after\nassuring her of her boundless gratitude, took her departure out of the\nback gate she had come in from.",
        "Reader, you do not know what happened after old goody Liu left, but\nlisten to the explanation which will be given in the next chapter.",
        "  Presentation of artificial flowers made in the Palace.\n  Chia Lien disports himself with Hsi-feng.\n  Pao-yü meets Ch’in Chung at a family party.",
        "To resume our narrative. Chou Jui’s wife having seen old goody Liu off,\nspeedily came to report the visit to madame Wang; but, contrary to her\nexpectation, she did not find madame Wang in the drawing-room; and it\nwas after inquiring of the waiting-maids that she eventually learnt that\nshe had just gone over to have a chat with “aunt” Hsüeh. Mrs. Chou, upon\nhearing this, hastily went out by the eastern corner door, and through\nthe yard on the east, into the Pear Fragrance Court.",
        "As soon as she reached the entrance, she caught sight of madame Wang’s\nwaiting-maid, Chin Ch’uan-erh, playing about on the terrace steps, with\na young girl, who had just let her hair grow. When they saw Chou Jui’s\nwife approach, they forthwith surmised that she must have some message\nto deliver, so they pursed up their lips and directed her to the\ninner-room. Chou Jui’s wife gently raised the curtain-screen, and upon\nentering discovered madame Wang, in voluble conversation with “aunt\"\nHsüeh, about family questions and people in general.",
        "Mrs. Chou did not venture to disturb them, and accordingly came into the\ninner room, where she found Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai in a house dress, with her\nhair simply twisted into a knot round the top of the head, sitting on\nthe inner edge of the stove-couch, leaning on a small divan table, in\nthe act of copying a pattern for embroidery, with the waiting-maid Ying\nErh. When she saw her enter, Pao Ch’ai hastily put down her pencil, and\nturning round with a face beaming with smiles, “Sister Chou,” she said,\n\"take a seat.”",
        "Chou Jui’s wife likewise promptly returned the smile.",
        "“How is my young lady?” she inquired, as she sat down on the edge of the\ncouch. “I haven’t seen you come over on the other side for two or three\ndays! Has Mr. Pao-yü perhaps given you offence?”",
        "“What an idea!” exclaimed Pao Ch’ai, with a smile. “It’s simply that\nI’ve had for the last couple of days my old complaint again, and that\nI’ve in consequence kept quiet all this time, and looked after myself.”",
        "“Is that it?” asked Chou Jui’s wife; “but after all, what rooted kind of\ncomplaint are you subject to, miss? you should lose really no time in\nsending for a doctor to diagnose it, and give you something to make you\nall right. With your tender years, to have an organic ailment is indeed\nno trifle!”",
        "Pao Ch’ai laughed when she heard these remarks.",
        "“Pray,” she said, “don’t allude to this again; for this ailment of mine\nI’ve seen, I can’t tell you, how many doctors; taken no end of medicine\nand spent I don’t know how much money; but the more we did so, not the\nleast little bit of relief did I see. Lucky enough, we eventually came\nacross a bald-pated bonze, whose speciality was the cure of nameless\nillnesses. We therefore sent for him to see me, and he said that I had\nbrought this along with me from the womb as a sort of inflammatory\nvirus, that luckily I had a constitution strong and hale so that it\ndidn’t matter; and that it would be of no avail if I took pills or any\nmedicines. He then told me a prescription from abroad, and gave me also\na packet of a certain powder as a preparative, with a peculiar smell and\nstrange flavour. He advised me, whenever my complaint broke out, to take\na pill, which would be sure to put me right again. And this has, after\nall, strange to say, done me a great deal of good.”",
        "“What kind of prescription is this one from abroad, I wonder,” remarked\nMrs. Chou; “if you, miss, would only tell me, it would be worth our\nwhile bearing it in mind, and recommending it to others: and if ever we\ncame across any one afflicted with this disease, we would also be doing\na charitable deed.”",
        "“You’d better not ask for the prescription,” rejoined Pao Ch’ai smiling.\n\"Why, its enough to wear one out with perplexity! the necessaries and\ningredients are few, and all easy to get, but it would be difficult to\nfind the lucky moment! You want twelve ounces of the pollen of the white\npeone, which flowers in spring, twelve ounces of the pollen of the white\nsummer lily, twelve ounces of the pollen of the autumn hibiscus flower,\nand twelve ounces of the white plum in bloom in the winter. You take the\nfour kinds of pollen, and put them in the sun, on the very day of the\nvernal equinox of the succeeding year to get dry, and then you mix them\nwith the powder and pound them well together. You again want twelve mace\nof water, fallen on ’rain water’ day.....”",
        "“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mrs. Chou promptly, as she laughed. “From all\nyou say, why you want three years’ time! and what if no rain falls on\n’rain water’ day! What would one then do?”",
        "“Quite so!” Pao Ch’ai remarked smilingly; “how can there be such an\nopportune rain on that very day! but to wait is also the best thing,\nthere’s nothing else to be done. Besides, you want twelve mace of dew,\ncollected on ’White Dew’ day, and twelve mace of the hoar frost,\ngathered on ’Frost Descent’ day, and twelve mace of snow, fallen on\n’Slight Snow’ day! You next take these four kinds of waters and mix them\nwith the other ingredients, and make pills of the size of a lungngan.\nYou keep them in an old porcelain jar, and bury them under the roots of\nsome flowers; and when the ailment betrays itself, you produce it and\ntake a pill, washing it down with two candareens of a yellow cedar\ndecoction.”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” cried Mrs. Chou, when she heard all this, bursting out\nlaughing. “It’s really enough to kill one! you might wait ten years and\nfind no such lucky moments!”",
        "“Fortunate for me, however,” pursued Pao Ch’ai, “in the course of a year\nor two, after the bonze had told me about this prescription, we got all\nthe ingredients; and, after much trouble, we compounded a supply, which\nwe have now brought along with us from the south to the north; and lies\nat present under the pear trees.”",
        "“Has this medicine any name or other of its own?” further inquired Mrs.\nChou.",
        "“It has a name,” replied Pao Ch’ai; “the mangy-headed bonze also told it\nme; he called it ’cold fragrance’ pill.”",
        "Chou Jui’s wife nodded her head, as she heard these words. “What do you\nfeel like after all when this complaint manifests itself?” she went on\nto ask.",
        "“Nothing much,” replied Pao Ch’ai; “I simply pant and cough a bit; but\nafter I’ve taken a pill, I get over it, and it’s all gone.”",
        "Mrs. Chou was bent upon making some further remark, when madame Wang was\nsuddenly heard to enquire, “Who is in here?”",
        "Mrs. Chou went out hurriedly and answered; and forthwith told her all\nabout old goody Liu’s visit. Having waited for a while, and seeing that\nmadame Wang had nothing to say, she was on the point of retiring, when\n\"aunt” Hsueh unexpectedly remarked smiling: “Wait a bit! I’ve something\nto give you to take along with you.”",
        "And as she spoke, she called for Hsiang Ling. The sound of the\nscreen-board against the sides of the door was heard, and in walked the\nwaiting-maid, who had been playing with Chin Ch’uan-erh. “Did my lady\ncall?” she asked.",
        "“Bring that box of flowers,” said Mrs. Hsueh.",
        "Hsiang Ling assented, and brought from the other side a small\nembroidered silk box.",
        "“These,” explained “aunt” Hsüeh, “are a new kind of flowers, made in the\npalace. They consist of twelve twigs of flowers of piled gauze. I\nthought of them yesterday, and as they will, the pity is, only get old,\nif uselessly put away, why not give them to the girls to wear them in\ntheir hair! I meant to have sent them over yesterday, but I forgot all\nabout them. You come to-day most opportunely, and if you will take them\nwith you, I shall have got them off my hands. To the three young ladies\nin your family give two twigs each, and of the six that will remain give\na couple to Miss Lin, and the other four to lady Feng.”",
        "“Better keep them and give them to your daughter Pao Ch’ai to wear,\"\nobserved madame Wang, “and have done with it; why think of all the\nothers?”",
        "“You don’t know, sister,” replied “aunt” Hsüeh, “what a crotchety thing\nPao Ch’ai is! she has no liking for flower or powder.”",
        "With these words on her lips, Chou Jui’s wife took the box and walked\nout of the door of the room. Perceiving that Chin Ch’uan-erh was still\nsunning herself outside, Chou Jui’s wife asked her: “Isn’t this Hsiang\r\nLing, the waiting-maid that we’ve often heard of as having been\npurchased just before the departure of the Hsüeh family for the capital,\nand on whose account there occurred some case of manslaughter or other?”",
        "“Of course it’s she,” replied Chin Ch’uan. But as they were talking,\nthey saw Hsiang Ling draw near smirkingly, and Chou Jui’s wife at once\nseized her by the hand, and after minutely scrutinizing her face for a\ntime, she turned round to Chin Ch’uan-erh and smiled. “With these\nfeatures she really resembles slightly the style of lady Jung of our\nEastern Mansion.”",
        "“So I too maintain!” said Chin Ch’uan-erh.",
        "Chou Jui’s wife then asked Hsiang Ling, “At what age did you enter this\nfamily? and where are your father and mother at present?” and also\ninquired, “In what year of your teens are you? and of what place are you\na native?”",
        "But Hsiang Ling, after listening to all these questions, simply nodded\nher head and replied, “I can’t remember.”",
        "When Mrs. Chou and Chin Ch’uan-erh heard these words, their spirits\nchanged to grief, and for a while they felt affected and wounded at\nheart; but in a short time, Mrs. Chou brought the flowers into the room\nat the back of madame Wang’s principal apartment.",
        "The fact is that dowager lady Chia had explained that as her\ngranddaughters were too numerous, it would not be convenient to crowd\nthem together in one place, that Pao-yü and Tai-yü should only remain\nwith her in this part to break her loneliness, but that Ying Ch’un, T’an\nCh’un, and Hsi Ch’un, the three of them, should move on this side in the\nthree rooms within the antechamber, at the back of madame lady Wang’s\nquarters; and that Li Wan should be told off to be their attendant and\nto keep an eye over them.",
        "Chou Jui’s wife, therefore, on this occasion came first to these rooms\nas they were on her way, but she only found a few waiting-maids\nassembled in the antechamber, waiting silently to obey a call.",
        "Ying Ch’un’s waiting-maid, Ssu Chi, together with Shih Shu, T’an Ch’un’s\r\nwaiting-maid, just at this moment raised the curtain, and made their\negress, each holding in her hand a tea-cup and saucer; and Chou Jui’s\nwife readily concluding that the young ladies were sitting together also\nwalked into the inner room, where she only saw Ying Ch’un and T’an Ch’un\nseated near the window, in the act of playing chess. Mrs. Chou presented\nthe flowers and explained whence they came, and what they were.",
        "The girls forthwith interrupted their game, and both with a curtsey,\nexpressed their thanks, and directed the waiting-maids to put the\nflowers away.",
        "Mrs. Chou complied with their wishes (and handing over the flowers);\n\"Miss Hsi Ch’un,” she remarked, “is not at home; and possibly she’s over\nthere with our old lady.”",
        "“She’s in that room, isn’t she?” inquired the waiting-maids.",
        "Mrs. Chou at these words readily came into the room on this side, where\nshe found Hsi Ch’un, in company with a certain Chih Neng, a young nun of\nthe “moon reflected on water” convent, talking and laughing together. On\nseeing Chou Jui’s wife enter, Hsi Ch’un at once asked what she wanted,\nwhereupon Chou Jui’s wife opened the box of flowers, and explained who\nhad sent them.",
        "“I was just telling Chih Neng,” remarked Hsi Ch’un laughing, “that I\nalso purpose shortly shaving my head and becoming a nun; and strange\nenough, here you again bring me flowers; but supposing I shave my head,\nwhere can I wear them?”",
        "They were all very much amused for a time with this remark, and Hsi\nCh’un told her waiting-maid, Ju Hua, to come and take over the flowers.",
        "“What time did you come over?” then inquired Mrs. Chou of Chih Neng.\n\"Where is that bald-pated and crotchety superior of yours gone?”",
        "“We came,” explained Chih Neng, “as soon as it was day; after calling\nupon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion of\nMr. Yü, and told me to wait for her here.”",
        "“Have you received,” further asked Mrs. Chou, “the monthly allowance for\nincense offering due on the fifteenth or not?”",
        "“I can’t say,” replied Chih Neng.",
        "“Who’s now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to the\nvarious temples?” interposed Hsi Ch’un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon as\nshe heard what was said.",
        "“It’s Yü Hsin,” replied Chou Jui’s wife, “who’s intrusted with the\ncharge.”",
        "“That’s how it is,” observed Hsi Ch’un with a chuckle; “soon after the\narrival of the Superior, Yü Hsin’s wife came over and kept on whispering\nwith her for some time; so I presume it must have been about this\nallowance.”",
        "Mrs. Chou then went on to bandy a few words with Chih Neng, after which\nshe came over to lady Feng’s apartments. Proceeding by a narrow passage,\nshe passed under Li Wan’s back windows, and went along the wall\nornamented with creepers on the west. Going out of the western side\ngate, she entered lady Feng’s court, and walked over into the Entrance\nHall, where she only found the waiting-girl Feng Erh, sitting on the\ndoorsteps of lady Feng’s apartments.",
        "When she caught sight of Mrs. Chou approaching, she at once waved her\nhand, bidding her go to the eastern room. Chou Jui’s wife understood her\nmeaning, and hastily came on tiptoe to the chamber on the east, where\nshe saw a nurse patting lady Feng’s daughter to sleep.",
        "Mrs. Chou promptly asked the nurse in a low tone of voice: “Is the young\nlady asleep at this early hour? But if even she is I must wake her up.”",
        "The nurse nodded her head in assent, but as these inquiries were being\nmade, a sound of laughter came from over the other side, in which lady\nFeng’s voice could be detected; followed, shortly after, by the sound of\na door opening, and out came P’ing Erh, with a large brass basin in her\nhands, which she told Feng Erh to fill with water and take inside.",
        "P’ing Erh forthwith entered the room on this side, and upon perceiving\nChou Jui’s wife: “What have you come here again for, my old lady?” she\nreadily inquired.",
        "Chou Jui’s wife rose without any delay, and handed her the box. “I’ve\ncome,” said she, “to bring you a present of flowers.”",
        "Upon hearing this, P’ing Erh opened the box, and took out four sprigs,\nand, turning round, walked out of the room. In a short while she came\nfrom the inner room with two sprigs in her hand, and calling first of\nall Ts’ai Ming, she bade her take the flowers over to the mansion on the\nother side and present them to “madame” Jung, after which she asked Mrs.\nChou to express her thanks on her return.",
        "Chou Jui’s wife thereupon came over to dowager lady Chia’s room on this\nside of the compound, and as she was going through the Entrance Hall,\nshe casually came, face to face, with her daughter, got up in gala\ndress, just coming from the house of her mother-in-law.",
        "“What are you running over here for at this time?” promptly inquired\nMrs. Chou.",
        "“Have you been well of late, mother?” asked her daughter. “I’ve been\nwaiting for ever so long at home, but you never come out! What’s there\r\nso pressing that has prevented you from returning home? I waited till I\nwas tired, and then went on all alone, and paid my respects to our\nvenerable lady; I’m now, on my way to inquire about our lady Wang. What\nerrand haven’t you delivered as yet, ma; and what is it you’re holding?”",
        "“Ai! as luck would have it,” rejoined Chou Jui’s wife smilingly, “old\ngoody Liu came over to-day, so that besides my own hundred and one\nduties, I’ve had to run about here and there ever so long, and all for\nher! While attending to these, Mrs. Hsueh came across me, and asked me\nto take these flowers to the young ladies, and I’ve been at it up to\nthis very moment, and haven’t done yet! But coming at this time, you\nmust surely have something or other that you want me to do for you!\nwhat’s it?”",
        "“Really ma, you’re quick at guessing!” exclaimed her daughter with a\nsmile; “I’ll tell you what it’s all about. The day before yesterday,\nyour son-in-law had a glass of wine too many, and began altercating with\nsome person or other; and some one, I don’t know why, spread some evil\nreport, saying that his antecedents were not clear, and lodged a charge\nagainst him at the Yamen, pressing the authorities to deport him to his\nnative place. That’s why I’ve come over to consult with you, as to whom\nwe should appeal to, to do us this favour of helping us out of our\ndilemma!”",
        "“I knew at once,” Mrs. Chou remarked after listening, “that there was\nsomething wrong; but this is nothing hard to settle! Go home and wait\nfor me and I’ll come straightway, as soon as I’ve taken these flowers to\nMiss Lin; our madame Wang and lady Secunda have both no leisure (to\nattend to you now,) so go back and wait for me! What’s the use of so\nmuch hurry!”",
        "Her daughter, upon hearing this, forthwith turned round to go back, when\nshe added as she walked away, “Mind, mother, and make haste.”",
        "“All right,” replied Chou Jui’s wife, “of course I will; you are young\nyet, and without experience, and that’s why you are in this flurry.”",
        "As she spoke, she betook herself into Tai-yü’s apartments. Contrary to\nher expectation Tai-yü was not at this time in her own room, but in\nPao-yü’s; where they were amusing themselves in trying to solve the\n\"nine strung rings” puzzle. On entering Mrs. Chou put on a smile.\n\"’Aunt’ Hsüeh,” she explained, “has told me to bring these flowers and\npresent them to you to wear in your hair.”",
        "“What flowers?” exclaimed Pao-yü. “Bring them here and let me see them.”",
        "As he uttered these words, he readily stretched out his hands and took\nthem over, and upon opening the box and looking in, he discovered, in\nfact, two twigs of a novel and artistic kind of artificial flowers, of\npiled gauze, made in the palace.",
        "Tai-yü merely cast a glance at them, as Pao-yü held them. “Have these\nflowers,” she inquired eagerly, “been sent to me alone, or have all the\nother girls got some too?”",
        "“Each one of the young ladies has the same,” replied Mrs. Chou; “and\nthese two twigs are intended for you, miss.”",
        "Tai-yü forced a smile. “Oh! I see,” she observed. “If all the others\nhadn’t chosen, even these which remain over wouldn’t have been given to\nme.”",
        "Chou Jui’s wife did not utter a word in reply.",
        "“Sister Chou, what took you over on the other side?” asked Pao-yü.",
        "“I was told that our madame Wang was over there,” explained Mrs. Chou,\n\"and as I went to give her a message, ’aunt’ Hsüeh seized the\nopportunity to ask me to bring over these flowers.”",
        "“What was cousin Pao Ch’ai doing at home?” asked Pao-yü. “How is it\nshe’s not even been over for these few days?”",
        "“She’s not quite well,” remarked Mrs. Chou.",
        "When Pao-yü heard this news, “Who’ll go,” he speedily ascertained of the\nwaiting-maids, “and inquire after her? Tell her that cousin Lin and I\nhave sent round to ask how our aunt and cousin are getting on! ask her\nwhat she’s ailing from and what medicines she’s taking, and explain to\nher that I know I ought to have gone over myself, but that on my coming\nback from school a short while back, I again got a slight chill; and\nthat I’ll go in person another day.”",
        "While Pao-yü was yet speaking, Hsi Hsüeh volunteered to take the\nmessage, and went off at once; and Mrs. Chou herself took her leave\nwithout another word.",
        "Mrs. Chou’s son-in-law was, in fact, Leng Tzu-hsing, the intimate friend\nof Yü-ts’un. Having recently become involved with some party in a\nlawsuit, on account of the sale of some curios, he had expressly charged\nhis wife to come and sue for the favour (of a helping hand). Chou Jui’s\nwife, relying upon her master’s prestige, did not so much as take the\naffair to heart; and having waited till evening, she simply went over\nand requested lady Feng to befriend her, and the matter was forthwith\nended.",
        "When the lamps were lit, lady Feng came over, after having disrobed\nherself, to see madame Wang. “I’ve already taken charge,” she observed,\n\"of the things sent round to-day by the Chen family. As for the presents\nfrom us to them, we should avail ourselves of the return of the boats,\nby which the fresh delicacies for the new year were forwarded, to hand\nthem to them to carry back.”",
        "Madame Wang nodded her head in token of approval.",
        "“The birthday presents,” continued lady Feng, “for lady Ling Ngan, the\nmother of the Earl of Ling Ngan, have already been got together, and\nwhom will you depute to take them over?”",
        "“See,” suggested madame Wang, “who has nothing to do; let four maids go\nand all will be right! why come again and ask me?”",
        "“Our eldest sister-in-law Chen,” proceeded lady Feng, “came over to\ninvite me to go to-morrow to their place for a little change. I don’t\nthink there will be anything for me to do to-morrow.”",
        "“Whether there be or not,” replied madame Wang, “it doesn’t matter; you\nmust go, for whenever she comes with an invitation, it includes us, who\nare your seniors, so that, of course, it isn’t such a pleasant thing for\nyou; but as she doesn’t ask us this time, but only asks you, it’s\nevident that she’s anxious that you should have a little distraction,\nand you mustn’t disappoint her good intention. Besides it’s certainly\nright that you should go over for a change.”",
        "Lady Feng assented, and presently Li Wan, Ying Ch’un and the other\ncousins, likewise paid each her evening salutation and retired to their\nrespective rooms, where nothing of any notice transpired.",
        "The next day lady Feng completed her toilette, and came over first to\ntell madame Wang that she was off, and then went to say good-bye to\ndowager lady Chia; but when Pao-yü heard where she was going, he also\nwished to go; and as lady Feng had no help but to give in, and to wait\nuntil he had changed his clothes, the sister and brother-in-law got into\na carriage, and in a short while entered the Ning mansion.",
        "Mrs. Yu, the wife of Chia Chen, and Mrs. Ch’in, the wife of Mr. Chia\nJung, the two sisters-in-law, had, along with a number of maids,\nwaiting-girls, and other servants, come as far as the ceremonial gate to\nreceive them, and Mrs. Yu, upon meeting lady Feng, for a while indulged,\nas was her wont, in humorous remarks, after which, leading Pao-yü by the\nhand, they entered the drawing room and took their seats, Mrs. Ch’in\nhanded tea round.",
        "“What have you people invited me to come here for?” promptly asked lady\nFeng; “if you have anything to present me with, hand it to me at once,\nfor I’ve other things to attend to.”",
        "Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Ch’in had barely any time to exchange any further\nremarks, when several matrons interposed, smilingly: “Had our lady not\ncome to-day, there would have been no help for it, but having come, you\ncan’t have it all your own way.”",
        "While they were conversing about one thing and another, they caught\nsight of Chia Jung come in to pay his respects, which prompted Pao-yü to\ninquire, “Isn’t my elder brother at home to-day?”",
        "“He’s gone out of town to-day,” replied Mrs. Yu, “to inquire after his\ngrandfather. You’ll find sitting here,” she continued, “very dull, and\nwhy not go out and have a stroll?”",
        "“A strange coincidence has taken place to-day,” urged Mrs. Ch’in, with a\nsmile; “some time back you, uncle Pao, expressed a wish to see my\nbrother, and to-day he too happens to be here at home. I think he’s in\nthe library; but why not go and see for yourself, uncle Pao?”",
        "Pao-yü descended at once from the stove-couch, and was about to go, when\nMrs. Yu bade the servants to mind and go with him. “Don’t you let him\nget into trouble,” she enjoined. “It’s a far different thing when he\ncomes over under the charge of his grandmother, when he’s all right.”",
        "“If that be so,” remarked lady Feng, “why not ask the young gentleman to\ncome in, and then I too can see him. There isn’t, I hope, any objection\nto my seeing him?”",
        "“Never mind! never mind!” observed Mrs. Yu, smilingly; “it’s as well\nthat you shouldn’t see him. This brother of mine is not, like the boys\nof our Chia family, accustomed to roughly banging and knocking about.\nOther people’s children are brought up politely and properly, and not in\nthis vixenish style of yours. Why, you’d ridicule him to death!”",
        "“I won’t laugh at him then, that’s all,” smiled lady Feng; “tell them to\nbring him in at once.”",
        "“He’s shy,” proceeded Mrs. Ch’in, “and has seen nothing much of the\nworld, so that you are sure to be put out when you see him, sister.”",
        "“What an idea!” exclaimed lady Feng. “Were he even No Cha himself, I’d\nlike to see him; so don’t talk trash; if, after all, you don’t bring him\nround at once, I’ll give you a good slap on the mouth.”",
        "“I daren’t be obstinate,” answered Mrs. Ch’in smiling; “I’ll bring him\nround!”",
        "In a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared with\nPao-yü, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior to\nPao-yü in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear and\nwell-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as graceful\nappearance and pleasing manners. He was however bashful and timid, like\na girl.",
        "In a shy and demure way, he made a bow to lady Feng and asked after her\nhealth.",
        "Lady Feng was simply delighted with him. “You take a low seat next to\nhim!” she ventured laughingly as she first pushed Pao-yü back. Then\nreadily stooping forward, she took this lad by the hand and asked him to\ntake a seat next to her. Presently she inquired about his age, his\nstudies and such matters, when she found that at school he went under\nthe name of Ch’in Chung.",
        "The matrons and maids in attendance on lady Feng, perceiving that this\nwas the first time their mistress met Ch’in Chung, (and knowing) that\nshe had not at hand the usual presents, forthwith ran over to the other\nside and told P’ing Erh about it.",
        "P’ing Erh, aware of the close intimacy that existed between lady Feng\nand Mrs. Ch’in, speedily took upon herself to decide, and selecting a\npiece of silk, and two small gold medals, (bearing the wish that he\nshould attain) the highest degree, the senior wranglership, she handed\nthem to the servants who had come over, to take away.",
        "Lady Feng, however, explained that her presents were too mean by far,\nbut Mrs. Ch’in and the others expressed their appreciation of them; and\nin a short time the repast was over, and Mrs. Yu, lady Feng and Mrs.\nCh’in played at dominoes, but of this no details need be given; while\nboth Pao-yü and Ch’in Chung sat down, got up and talked, as they\npleased.",
        "Since he had first glanced at Ch’in Chung, and seen what kind of person\nhe was, he felt at heart as if he had lost something, and after being\nplunged in a dazed state for a time, he began again to give way to\nfoolish thoughts in his mind.",
        "“There are then such beings as he in the world!” he reflected. “I now\nsee there are! I’m however no better than a wallowing pig or a mangy\ncow! Despicable destiny! why was I ever born in this household of a\nmarquis and in the mansion of a duke? Had I seen the light in the home\nof some penniless scholar, or poverty-stricken official, I could long\nago have enjoyed the communion of his friendship, and I would not have\nlived my whole existence in vain! Though more honourable than he, it is\nindeed evident that silk and satins only serve to swathe this rotten\ntrunk of mine, and choice wines and rich meats only to gorge the filthy\ndrain and miry sewer of this body of mine! Wealth! and splendour! ye are\nno more than contaminated with pollution by me!”",
        "Ever since Ch’in Chung had noticed Pao-yü’s unusual appearance, his\nsedate deportment, and what is more, his hat ornamented with gold, and\nhis dress full of embroidery, attended by beautiful maids and handsome\nyouths, he did not indeed think it a matter of surprise that every one\nwas fond of him.",
        "“Born as I have had the misfortune to be,” he went on to commune within\nhimself, “in an honest, though poor family, how can I presume to enjoy\nhis companionship! This is verily a proof of what a barrier poverty and\nwealth set between man and man. What a serious misfortune is this too in\nthis mortal world!”",
        "In wild and inane ideas of the same strain, indulged these two youths!",
        "Pao-yü by and by further asked of him what books he was reading, and\nCh’in Chung, in answer to these inquiries, told him the truth. A few\nmore questions and answers followed; and after about ten remarks, a\ngreater intimacy sprang up between them.",
        "Tea and fruits were shortly served, and while they were having their\ntea, Pao-yü suggested, “We two don’t take any wine, and why shouldn’t we\nhave our fruit served on the small couch inside, and go and sit there,\nand thus save you all the trouble?”",
        "The two of them thereupon came into the inner apartment to have their\ntea; and Mrs. Ch’in attended to the laying out of fruit and wines for\nlady Feng, and hurriedly entered the room and hinted to Pao-yü: “Dear\nuncle Pao, your nephew is young, and should he happen to say anything\ndisrespectful, do please overlook it, for my sake, for though shy, he’s\nnaturally of a perverse and wilful disposition, and is rather given to\nhaving his own way.”",
        "“Off with you!” cried Pao-yü laughing; “I know it all.” Mrs. Ch’in then\nwent on to give a bit of advice to her brother, and at length came to\nkeep lady Feng company. Presently lady Feng and Mrs. Yu sent another\nservant to tell Pao-yü that there was outside of everything they might\nwish to eat and that they should mind and go and ask for it; and Pao-yü\nsimply signified that they would; but his mind was not set upon drinking\nor eating; all he did was to keep making inquiries of Ch’in Chung about\nrecent family concerns.",
        "Ch’in Chung went on to explain that his tutor had last year relinquished\nhis post, that his father was advanced in years and afflicted with\ndisease, and had multifarious public duties to preoccupy his mind, so\nthat he had as yet had no time to make arrangements for another tutor,\nand that all he did was no more than to keep up his old tasks; that as\nregards study, it was likewise necessary to have the company of one or\ntwo intimate friends, as then only, by dint of a frequent exchange of\nideas and opinions, one could arrive at progress; and Pao-yü gave him no\ntime to complete, but eagerly urged, “Quite so! But in our household, we\nhave a family school, and those of our kindred who have no means\nsufficient to engage the services of a tutor are at liberty to come over\nfor the sake of study, and the sons and brothers of our relatives are\nlikewise free to join the class. As my own tutor went home last year, I\nam now also wasting my time doing nothing; my father’s intention was\nthat I too should have gone over to this school, so that I might at\nleast temporarily keep up what I have already read, pending the arrival\nof my tutor next year, when I could again very well resume my studies\nalone at home. But my grandmother raised objections; maintaining first\nof all, that the boys who attend the family classes being so numerous,\nshe feared we would be sure to be up to mischief, which wouldn’t be at\nall proper; and that, in the second place, as I had been ill for some\ntime, the matter should be dropped, for the present. But as, from what\nyou say, your worthy father is very much exercised on this score, you\nshould, on your return, tell him all about it, and come over to our\nschool. I’ll also be there as your schoolmate; and as you and I will\nreap mutual benefit from each other’s companionship, won’t it be nice!”",
        "“When my father was at home the other day,” Ch’in Chung smiled and said,\n\"he alluded to the question of a tutor, and explained that the free\nschools were an excellent institution. He even meant to have come and\ntalked matters over with his son-in-law’s father about my introduction,\nbut with the urgent concerns here, he didn’t think it right for him to\ncome about this small thing, and make any trouble. But if you really\nbelieve that I might be of use to you, in either grinding the ink, or\nwashing the slab, why shouldn’t you at once make the needful\narrangements, so that neither you nor I may idle our time? And as we\nshall be able to come together often and talk matters over, and set at\nthe same time our parents’ minds at ease, and to enjoy the pleasure of\nfriendship, won’t it be a profitable thing!”",
        "“Compose your mind!” suggested Pao-yü. “We can by and by first of all,\ntell your brother-in-law, and your sister as well as sister-in-law\nSecunda Lien; and on your return home to-day, lose no time in explaining\nall to your worthy father, and when I get back, I’ll speak to my\ngrandmother; and I can’t see why our wishes shouldn’t speedily be\naccomplished.”",
        "By the time they had arrived at this conclusion, the day was far\nadvanced, and the lights were about to be lit; and they came out and\nwatched them once more for a time as they played at dominoes. When they\ncame to settle their accounts Mrs. Ch’in and Mrs. Yu were again the\nlosers and had to bear the expense of a theatrical and dinner party; and\nwhile deciding that they should enjoy this treat the day after the\nmorrow, they also had the evening repast.",
        "Darkness having set in, Mrs. Yu gave orders that two youths should\naccompany Mr. Ch’in home. The matrons went out to deliver the\ndirections, and after a somewhat long interval, Ch’in Chung said goodbye\nand was about to start on his way.",
        "“Whom have you told off to escort him?” asked Mrs. Yu.",
        "“Chiao Ta,” replied the matrons, “has been told to go, but it happens\nthat he’s under the effects of drink and making free use again of\nabusive language.”",
        "Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Chin remonstrated. “What’s the use,” they said, “of\nasking him? that mean fellow shouldn’t be chosen, but you will go again\nand provoke him.”",
        "“People always maintain,” added lady Feng, “that you are far too\nlenient. But fancy allowing servants in this household to go on in this\nway; why, what will be the end of it?”",
        "“You don’t mean to tell me,” observed Mrs. Yu, “that you don’t know this\nChiao Ta? Why, even the gentlemen one and all pay no heed to his doings!\nyour eldest brother, Chia Cheng, he too doesn’t notice him. It’s all\nbecause when he was young he followed our ancestor in three or four\nwars, and because on one occasion, by extracting our senior from the\nheap of slain and carrying him on his back, he saved his life. He\nhimself suffered hunger and stole food for his master to eat; they had\nno water for two days; and when he did get half a bowl, he gave it to\nhis master, while he himself had sewage water. He now simply presumes\nupon the sentimental obligations imposed by these services. When the\nseniors of the family still lived, they all looked upon him with\nexceptional regard; but who at present ventures to interfere with him?\nHe is also advanced in years, and doesn’t care about any decent manners;\nhis sole delight is wine; and when he gets drunk, there isn’t a single\nperson whom he won’t abuse. I’ve again and again told the stewards not\nto henceforward ask Chiao Ta to do any work whatever, but to treat him\nas dead and gone; and here he’s sent again to-day.”",
        "“How can I not know all about this Chiao Ta?” remarked lady Feng; “but\nthe secret of all this trouble is, that you won’t take any decisive\nstep. Why not pack him off to some distant farm, and have done with\nhim?” And as she spoke, “Is our carriage ready?” she went on to inquire.",
        "“All ready and waiting,” interposed the married women.",
        "Lady Feng also got up, said good-bye, and hand in hand with Pao-yü, they\nwalked out of the room, escorted by Mrs. Yu and the party, as far as the\nentrance of the Main Hall, where they saw the lamps shedding a brilliant\nlight and the attendants all waiting on the platforms. Chiao Ta,\nhowever, availing himself of Chia Chen’s absence from home, and elated\nby wine, began to abuse the head steward Lai Erh for his injustice.",
        "“You bully of the weak and coward with the strong,” he cried, “when\nthere’s any pleasant charge, you send the other servants, but when it’s\na question of seeing any one home in the dark, then you ask me, you\ndisorderly clown! a nice way you act the steward, indeed! Do you forget\nthat if Mr. Chiao Ta chose to raise one leg, it would be a good deal\nhigher than your head! Remember please, that twenty years ago, Mr. Chiao\nTa wouldn’t even so much as look at any one, no matter who it was; not\nto mention a pack of hybrid creatures like yourselves!”",
        "While he went on cursing and railing with all his might, Chia Jung\nappeared walking by lady Feng’s carriage. All the servants having tried\nto hush him and not succeeding, Chia Jung became exasperated; and\nforthwith blew him up for a time. “Let some one bind him up,” he cried,\n\"and tomorrow, when he’s over the wine, I’ll call him to task, and we’ll\nsee if he won’t seek death.”",
        "Chiao Ta showed no consideration for Chia Jung. On the contrary, he\nshouted with more vigour. Going up to Chia Jung: “Brother Jung,” he\nsaid, “don’t put on the airs of a master with Chiao Ta. Not to speak of\na man such as you, why even your father and grandfather wouldn’t presume\nto display such side with Chiao Ta. Were it not for Chiao Ta, and him\nalone, where would your office, honours, riches and dignity be? Your\nancestor, whom I brought back from the jaws of death, heaped up all this\nestate, but up to this very day have I received no thanks for the\nservices I rendered! on the contrary, you come here and play the master;\ndon’t say a word more, and things may come right; but if you do, I’ll\nplunge the blade of a knife white in you and extract it red.”",
        "Lady Feng, from inside the carriage, remarked to Chia Jung: “Don’t you\nyet pack off this insolent fellow! Why, if you keep him in your house,\nwon’t he be a source of mischief? Besides, were relatives and friends to\nhear about these things, won’t they have a laugh at our expense, that a\nhousehold like ours should be so devoid of all propriety?”",
        "Chia Jung assented. The whole band of servants finding that Chiao Ta was\ngetting too insolent had no help but to come up and throw him over, and\nbinding him up, they dragged him towards the stables. Chiao Ta abused\neven Chia Chen with still more vehemence, and shouted in a boisterous\nmanner. “I want to go,” he cried, “to the family Ancestral Temple and\nmourn my old master. Who would have ever imagined that he would leave\nbehind such vile creatures of descendants as you all, day after day\nindulging in obscene and incestuous practices, ’in scraping of the\nashes’ and in philandering with brothers-in-law. I know all about your\ndoings; the best thing is to hide one’s stump of an arm in one’s\nsleeve!” (wash one’s dirty clothes at home).",
        "The servants who stood by, upon hearing this wild talk, were quite at\ntheir wits’ end, and they at once seized him, tied him up, and filled\nhis mouth to the fullest extent with mud mixed with some horse refuse.",
        "Lady Feng and Chia Jung heard all he said from a distance, but pretended\nnot to hear; but Pao-yü, seated in the carriage as he was, also caught\nthis extravagant talk and inquired of lady Feng: “Sister, did you hear\nhim say something about ’scraping of the ashes?’ What’s it?”",
        "“Don’t talk such rubbish!” hastily shouted lady Feng; “it was the\nmaudlin talk of a drunkard! A nice boy you are! not to speak of your\nlistening, but you must also inquire! wait and I’ll tell your mother and\nwe’ll see if she doesn’t seriously take you to task.”",
        "Pao-yü was in such a state of fright that he speedily entreated her to\nforgive him. “My dear sister,” he craved, “I won’t venture again to say\nanything of the kind”",
        "“My dear brother, if that be so, it’s all right!” rejoined lady Feng\nreassuringly; “on our return we’ll speak to her venerable ladyship and\nask her to send some one to arrange matters in the family school, and\ninvite Ch’in Chung to come to school for his studies.”",
        "While yet this conversation was going on, they arrived at the Jung\nMansion.",
        "Reader, do you wish to know what follows? if you do, the next chapter\nwill unfold it.",
        "  By a strange coincidence, Chia Pao-yü becomes acquainted with the\n      golden clasp.\n  In an unexpected meeting, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai sees the jade of spiritual\n      perception.",
        "Pao-yü and lady Feng, we will now explain, paid, on their return home,\ntheir respects to all the inmates, and Pao-yü availed himself of the\nfirst occasion to tell dowager lady Chia of his wish that Ch’in Chung\nshould come over to the family school. “The presence for himself of a\nfriend as schoolmate would,” he argued, “be fitly excellent to stir him\nto zeal,” and he went on to speak in terms of high praise of Ch’in\nChung, his character and his manners, which most of all made people\nesteem him.",
        "Lady Feng besides stood by him and backed his request. “In a day or\ntwo,” she added, “Ch’in Chung will be coming to pay his obeisance to\nyour venerable ladyship.”",
        "This bit of news greatly rejoiced the heart of dowager lady Chia, and\nlady Feng likewise did not let the opportunity slip, without inviting\nthe old lady to attend the theatrical performance to come off the day\nafter the morrow. Dowager lady Chia was, it is true, well on in years,\nbut was, nevertheless, very fond of enjoyment, so that when the day\narrived and Mrs. Yu came over to invite her round, she forthwith took\nmadame Wang, Lin Tai-yü, Pao-yü and others along and went to the play.",
        "It was about noon, when dowager lady Chia returned to her apartments for\nher siesta; and madame Wang, who was habitually partial to a quiet life,\nalso took her departure after she had seen the old lady retire. Lady\nFeng subsequently took the seat of honour; and the party enjoyed\nthemselves immensely till the evening, when they broke up.",
        "But to return to Pao-yü. Having accompanied his grandmother Chia back\nhome, and waited till her ladyship was in her midday sleep, he had in\nfact an inclination to return to the performance, but he was afraid lest\nhe should be a burden to Mrs. Ch’in and the rest and lest they should\nnot feel at ease. Remembering therefore that Pao Ch’ai had been at home\nunwell for the last few days, and that he had not been to see her, he\nwas anxious to go and look her up, but he dreaded that if he went by the\nside gate, at the back of the drawing-room, he would be prevented by\nsomething or other, and fearing, what would be making matters worse,\nlest he should come across his father, he consequently thought it better\nto go on his way by a detour. The nurses and waiting-maids thereupon\ncame to help him to change his clothes; but they saw him not change, but\ngo out again by the second door. These nurses and maids could not help\nfollowing him out; but they were still under the impression that he was\ngoing over to the other mansion to see the theatricals. Contrary to\ntheir speculations, upon reaching the entrance hall, he forthwith went\nto the east, then turned to the north, and walking round by the rear of\nthe hall, he happened to come face to face with two of the family\ncompanions, Mr. Ch’an Kuang, and Mr. Tan T’ing-jen. As soon as they\ncaught sight of Pao-yü, they both readily drew up to him, and as they\nsmiled, the one put his arm round his waist, while the other grasped him\nby the hand.",
        "“Oh divine brother!” they both exclaimed, “this we call dreaming a\npleasant dream, for it’s no easy thing to come across you!”",
        "While continuing their remarks they paid their salutations, and inquired\nafter his health; and it was only after they had chatted for ever so\nlong, that they went on their way. The nurse called out to them and\nstopped them, “Have you two gentlemen,” she said, “come out from seeing\nmaster?”",
        "They both nodded assent. “Your master,” they explained, “is in the Meng\nP’o Chai small library having his siesta; so that you can go through\nthere with no fear.”",
        "As they uttered these words, they walked away.",
        "This remark also evoked a smile from Pao-yü, but without further delay\nhe turned a corner, went towards the north, and came into the Pear\nFragrance Court, where, as luck would have it, he met the head manager\nof the Household Treasury, Wu Hsin-teng, who, in company with the head\nof the granary, Tai Liang, and several other head stewards, seven\npersons in all, was issuing out of the Account Room.",
        "On seeing Pao-yü approaching, they, in a body, stood still, and hung\ndown their arms against their sides. One of them alone, a certain\nbutler, called Ch’ien Hua, promptly came forward, as he had not seen\nPao-yü for many a day, and bending on one knee, paid his respects to\nPao-yü. Pao-yü at once gave a smile and pulled him up.",
        "“The day before yesterday,” smiled all the bystanders, “we were\nsomewhere together and saw some characters written by you, master\nSecundus, in the composite style. The writing is certainly better than\nit was before! When will you give us a few sheets to stick on the wall?”",
        "“Where did you see them?” inquired Pao-yü, with a grin.",
        "“They are to be found in more than one place,” they replied, “and every\none praises them very much, and what’s more, asks us for a few.”",
        "“They are not worth having,” observed Pao-yü smilingly; “but if you do\nwant any, tell my young servants and it will be all right.”",
        "As he said these words, he moved onwards. The whole party waited till he\nhad gone by, before they separated, each one to go his own way.",
        "But we need not dilate upon matters of no moment, but return to Pao-yü.",
        "On coming to the Pear Fragrance Court, he entered, first, into “aunt\"\nHsüeh’s room, where he found her getting some needlework ready to give\nto the waiting-maids to work at. Pao-yü forthwith paid his respects to\nher, and “aunt” Hsüeh, taking him by the hand, drew him towards her and\nclasped him in her embrace.",
        "“With this cold weather,” she smilingly urged, “it’s too kind of you, my\ndear child, to think of coming to see me; come along on the stove-couch\nat once!–Bring some tea,” she continued, addressing the servants, “and\nmake it as hot as it can be!”",
        "“Isn’t Hsüeh P’an at home?” Pao-yü having inquired: “He’s like a horse\nwithout a halter,” Mrs. Hsüeh remarked with a sigh; “he’s daily running\nhere and there and everywhere, and nothing can induce him to stay at\nhome one single day.”",
        "“Is sister (Pao Ch’ai) all right again?” asked Pao-yü. “Yes,” replied\nMrs. Hsüeh, “she’s well again. It was very kind of you two days ago to\nagain think of her, and send round to inquire after her. She’s now in\nthere, and you can go and see her. It’s warmer there than it’s here; go\nand sit with her inside, and, as soon as I’ve put everything away, I’ll\ncome and join you and have a chat.”",
        "Pao-yü, upon hearing this, jumped down with alacrity from the\nstove-couch, and walked up to the door of the inner room, where he saw\nhanging a portière somewhat the worse for use, made of red silk. Pao-yü\nraised the portière and making one step towards the interior, he found\nPao Ch’ai seated on the couch, busy over some needlework. On the top of\nher head was gathered, and made into a knot, her chevelure, black as\nlacquer, and glossy like pomade. She wore a honey-coloured wadded robe,\na rose-brown short-sleeved jacket, lined with the fur of the squirrel of\ntwo colours: the “gold and silver;” and a jupe of leek-yellow silk. Her\nwhole costume was neither too new, neither too old, and displayed no\nsign of extravagance.",
        "Her lips, though not rouged, were naturally red; her eyebrows, though\nnot pencilled, were yet blue black; her face resembled a silver basin,\nand her eyes, juicy plums. She was sparing in her words, chary in her\ntalk, so much so that people said that she posed as a simpleton. She was\nquiet in the acquittal of her duties and scrupulous as to the proper\nseason for everything. “I practise simplicity,” she would say of\nherself.",
        "“How are you? are you quite well again, sister?” inquired Pao-yü, as he\ngazed at her; whereupon Pao Ch’ai raised her head, and perceiving Pao-yü\nwalk in, she got up at once and replied with a smile, “I’m all right\nagain; many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me.”",
        "While uttering this, she pressed him to take a seat on the stove-couch,\nand as he sat down on the very edge of the couch, she told Ying Erh to\nbring tea and asked likewise after dowager lady Chia and lady Feng. “And\nare all the rest of the young ladies quite well?” she inquired.",
        "Saying this she scrutinised Pao-yü, who she saw had a head-dress of\npurplish-gold twisted threads, studded with precious stones. His\nforehead was bound with a gold circlet, representing two dragons,\nclasping a pearl. On his person he wore a light yellow, archery-sleeved\njacket, ornamented with rampant dragons, and lined with fur from the\nribs of the silver fox; and was clasped with a dark sash, embroidered\nwith different-coloured butterflies and birds. Round his neck was hung\nan amulet, consisting of a clasp of longevity, a talisman of recorded\nname, and, in addition to these, the precious jade which he had had in\nhis mouth at the time of his birth.",
        "“I’ve daily heard every one speak of this jade,” said Pao Ch’ai with a\nsmile, “but haven’t, after all, had an opportunity of looking at it\nclosely, but anyhow to-day I must see it.”",
        "As she spoke, she drew near. Pao-yü himself approached, and taking it\nfrom his neck, he placed it in Pao Ch’ai’s hand. Pao Ch’ai held it in\nher palm. It appeared to her very much like the egg of a bird,\nresplendent as it was like a bright russet cloud; shiny and smooth like\nvariegated curd and covered with a net for the sake of protection.",
        "Readers, you should know that this was the very block of useless stone\nwhich had been on the Ta Huang Hills, and which had dropped into the\nCh’ing Keng cave, in a state of metamorphosis. A later writer expresses\nhis feelings in a satirical way as follows:",
        "  Nü Wo’s fusion of stones was e’er a myth inane,\n  But from this myth hath sprung fiction still more insane!\n  Lost is the subtle life, divine, and real!–gone!\n  Assumed, mean subterfuge! foul bags of skin and bone!\n  Fortune, when once adverse, how true! gold glows no more!\n  In evil days, alas! the jade’s splendour is o’er!\n  Bones, white and bleached, in nameless hill-like mounds are flung,\n  Bones once of youths renowned and maidens fair and young.",
        "The rejected stone has in fact already given a record of the\ncircumstances of its transformation, and the inscription in seal\ncharacters, engraved upon it by the bald-headed bonze, and below will\nnow be also appended a faithful representation of it; but its real size\nis so very diminutive, as to allow of its being held by a child in his\nmouth while yet unborn, that were it to have been drawn in its exact\nproportions, the characters would, it is feared, have been so\ninsignificant in size, that the beholder would have had to waste much of\nhis eyesight, and it would besides have been no pleasant thing.",
        "While therefore its shape has been adhered to, its size has unavoidably\nbeen slightly enlarged, to admit of the reader being able, conveniently,\nto peruse the inscription, even by very lamplight, and though he may be\nunder the influence of wine.",
        "These explanations have been given to obviate any such sneering remarks\nas: “What could be, pray, the size of the mouth of a child in his\nmother’s womb, and how could it grasp such a large and clumsy thing?”",
        "On the face of the jade was written:",
        "  Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.\n  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,\n  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!",
        "On the reverse was written:",
        "  1 To exorcise evil spirits and the accessory visitations;\n  2 To cure predestined sickness;\n  3 To prognosticate weal and woe.",
        "Pao Ch’ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, and\nscrutinising it closely, read aloud:",
        "  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,\n  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!",
        "She perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked Ying Erh\nlaughingly: “Why don’t you go and pour the tea? what are you standing\nhere like an idiot!”",
        "“These two lines which I’ve heard,” smiled Ying Erh, “would appear to\npair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!”",
        "“What!” eagerly observed Pao-yü with a grin, when he caught these words,\n\"are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do let\nme too see it.”",
        "“Don’t listen to what she says,” remarked Pao Ch’ai, “there are no\ncharacters on it.”",
        "“My dear cousin,” pleaded Pao-yü entreatingly, “how is it you’ve seen\nmine?”",
        "Pao Ch’ai was brought quite at bay by this remark of his, and she\nconsequently added, “There are also two propitious phrases engraved on\nthis charm, and that’s why I wear it every day. Otherwise, what pleasure\nwould there be in carrying a clumsy thing.”",
        "As she spoke, she unfastened the button, and produced from inside her\ncrimson robe, a crystal-like locket, set with pearls and gems, and with\na brilliant golden fringe. Pao-yü promptly received it from her, and\nupon minute examination, found that there were in fact four characters\non each side; the eight characters on both sides forming two sentences\nof good omen. The similitude of the locket is likewise then given below.\nOn the face of the locket is written:",
        "  “Part not from me and cast me not away;”",
        "And on the reverse:",
        "  “And youth, perennial freshness will display!”",
        "Pao-yü examined the charm, and having also read the inscription twice\nover aloud, and then twice again to himself, he said as he smiled, “Dear\ncousin, these eight characters of yours form together with mine an\nantithetical verse.”",
        "“They were presented to her,” ventured Ying Erh, “by a mangy-pated\nbonze, who explained that they should be engraved on a golden\ntrinket....”",
        "Pao Ch’ai left her no time to finish what she wished to say, but\nspeedily called her to task for not going to bring the tea, and then\ninquired of Pao-yü “Where he had come from?”",
        "Pao-yü had, by this time, drawn quite close to Pao Ch’ai, and perceived\nwhiff after whiff of some perfume or other, of what kind he could not\ntell. “What perfume have you used, my cousin,” he forthwith asked, “to\nfumigate your dresses with? I really don’t remember smelling any\nperfumery of the kind before.”",
        "“I’m very averse,” replied Pao Ch’ai blandly, “to the odour of\nfumigation; good clothes become impregnated with the smell of smoke.”",
        "“In that case,” observed Pao-yü, “what scent is it?”",
        "“Yes, I remember,” Pao Ch’ai answered, after some reflection; “it’s the\nscent of the ’cold fragrance’ pills which I took this morning.”",
        "“What are these cold fragrance pills,” remarked Pao-yü smiling, “that\nthey have such a fine smell? Give me, cousin, a pill to try.”",
        "“Here you are with your nonsense again,” Pao Ch’ai rejoined laughingly;\n\"is a pill a thing to be taken recklessly?”",
        "She had scarcely finished speaking, when she heard suddenly some one\noutside say, “Miss Lin is come;” and shortly Lin Tai-yü walked in in a\njaunty manner.",
        "“Oh, I come at a wrong moment!” she exclaimed forthwith, smirking\nsignificantly when she caught sight of Pao-yü.",
        "Pao-yü and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat,\nwhereupon Pao Ch’ai added with a smile, “How can you say such things?”",
        "“Had I known sooner,” continued Tai-yü, “that he was here, I would have\nkept away.”",
        "“I can’t fathom this meaning of yours,” protested Pao Ch’ai.",
        "“If one comes,” Tai-yü urged smiling, “then all come, and when one\ndoesn’t come, then no one comes. Now were he to come to-day, and I to\ncome to-morrow, wouldn’t there be, by a division of this kind, always\nsome one with you every day? and in this way, you wouldn’t feel too\nlonely, nor too crowded. How is it, cousin, that you didn’t understand\nwhat I meant to imply?”",
        "“Is it snowing?” inquired Pao-yü, upon noticing that she wore a cloak\nmade of crimson camlet, buttoning in front.",
        "“It has been snowing for some time,” ventured the matrons, who were\nstanding below. “Fetch my wrapper!” Pao-yü remarked, and Tai-yü readily\nlaughed. “Am I not right? I come, and, of course, he must go at once.”",
        "“Did I ever mention that I was going?” questioned Pao-yü; “I only wish\nit brought to have it ready when I want it.”",
        "“It’s a snowy day,” consequently remarked Pao-yü’s nurse, dame Li, “and\nwe must also look to the time, but you had better remain here and amuse\nyourself with your cousin. Your aunt has, in there, got ready tea and\nfruits. I’ll tell the waiting-maid to go and fetch your wrapper and the\nboys to return home.” Pao-yü assented, and nurse Li left the room and\ntold the boys that they were at liberty to go.",
        "By this time Mrs. Hsüeh had prepared tea and several kinds of nice\nthings and kept them all to partake of those delicacies. Pao-yü, having\nspoken highly of some goose feet and ducks’ tongues he had tasted some\ndays before, at his eldest sister-in-law’s, Mrs. Yu’s, “aunt” Hsüeh\npromptly produced several dishes of the same kind, made by herself, and\ngave them to Pao-yü to try. “With a little wine,” added Pao-yü with a\nsmile, “they would be first rate.”",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh thereupon bade the servants fetch some wine of the best\nquality; but dame Li came forward and remonstrated. “My lady,” she said,\n\"never mind the wine.”",
        "Pao-yü smilingly pleaded: “My nurse, I’ll take just one cup and no\nmore.”",
        "“It’s no use,” nurse Li replied, “were your grandmother and mother\npresent, I wouldn’t care if you drank a whole jar. I remember the day\nwhen I turned my eyes away but for a moment, and some ignorant fool or\nother, merely with the view of pandering for your favour, gave you only\na drop of wine to drink, and how this brought reproaches upon me for a\ncouple of days. You don’t know, my lady, you have no idea of his\ndisposition! it’s really dreadful; and when he has had a little wine he\nshows far more temper. On days when her venerable ladyship is in high\nspirits, she allows him to have his own way about drinking, but he’s not\nallowed to have wine on any and every day; and why should I have to\nsuffer inside and all for nothing at all?”",
        "“You antiquated thing!” replied Mrs. Hsüeh laughing, “set your mind at\nease, and go and drink your own wine! I won’t let him have too much, and\nshould even the old lady say anything, let the fault be mine.”",
        "Saying this, she asked a waiting-maid to take nurse Li along with her\nand give her also a glass of wine so as to keep out the cold air.",
        "When nurse Li heard these words, she had no alternative but to go for a\ntime with all the others and have some wine to drink.",
        "“The wine need not be warmed: I prefer it cold!” Pao-yü went on to\nsuggest meanwhile.",
        "“That won’t do,” remonstrated Mrs. Hsüeh; “cold wine will make your hand\ntremble when you write.”",
        "“You have,” interposed Pao Ch’ai smiling, “the good fortune, cousin\nPao-yü, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of every\nkind of subject, and yet don’t you know that the properties of wine are\nmostly heating? If you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but if\nyou drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon your\nintestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm?\nand won’t you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave off\nat once drinking that cold wine.”",
        "Pao-yü finding that the words he had heard contained a good deal of\nsense, speedily put down the cold wine, and having asked them to warm\nit, he at length drank it.",
        "Tai-yü was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simply\npursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, Hsüeh Yen,\nTai-yü’s waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a small\nhand-stove.",
        "“Who told you to bring it?” ascertained Tai-yü grinningly. “I’m sorry to\nhave given whoever it is the trouble; I’m obliged to her. But did she\never imagine that I would freeze to death?”",
        "“Tzu Chuan was afraid,” replied Hsüeh Yen, “that you would, miss, feel\ncold, and she asked me to bring it over.”",
        "Tai-yü took it over and held it in her lap. “How is it,” she smiled,\n\"that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what I say,\nday after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! How is it that\nyou at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you\nwould an imperial edict?”",
        "When Pao-yü heard this, he felt sure in his mind that Tai-yü was\navailing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no\nremark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice. Pao\nCh’ai, again, knew full well that this habit was a weak point with\nTai-yü, so she too did not go out of her way to heed what she said.",
        "“You’ve always been delicate and unable to stand the cold,” interposed\n\"aunt” Hsüeh, “and is it not a kind attention on their part to have\nthought of you?”",
        "“You don’t know, aunt, how it really stands,” responded Tai-yü\nsmilingly; “fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters;\nfor had it been in any one else’s house, wouldn’t it have been a slight\nupon them? Is it forsooth nice to think that people haven’t so much as a\nhand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? People\nwon’t say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imagine\nthat I’m in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion.”",
        "“You’re far too punctilious,” remarked Mrs. Hsüeh, “as to entertain such\nnotions! No such ideas as these crossed my mind just now.”",
        "While they were conversing, Pao-yü had taken so much as three cups of\nwine, and nurse Li came forward again to prevent him from having any\nmore. Pao-yü was just then in a state of exultation and excitement, (a\nstate) enhanced by the conversation and laughter of his cousins, so that\nwas he ready to agree to having no more! But he was constrained in a\nhumble spirit to entreat for permission. “My dear nurse,” he implored,\n\"I’ll just take two more cups and then have no more.”",
        "“You’d better be careful,” added nurse Li, “your father is at home\nto-day, and see that you’re ready to be examined in your lessons.”",
        "When Pao-yü heard this mention, his spirits at once sank within him, and\ngently putting the wine aside, he dropped his head upon his breast.",
        "Tai-yü promptly remonstrated. “You’ve thrown cold water,” she said,\n\"over the spirits of the whole company; why, if uncle should ask to see\nyou, well, say that aunt Hsüeh detained you. This old nurse of yours has\nbeen drinking, and again makes us the means of clearing her muddled\nhead!”",
        "While saying this, she gave Pao-yü a big nudge with the intent of\nstirring up his spirits, adding, as she addressed him in a low tone of\nvoice: “Don’t let us heed that old thing, but mind our own enjoyment.”",
        "Dame Li also knew very well Tai-yü’s disposition, and therefore\nremarked: “Now, Miss Lin, don’t you urge him on; you should after all,\ngive him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of what\nyou say to him.”",
        "“Why should I urge him on?” rejoined Lin Tai-yü, with a sarcastic smile,\n\"nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are far\ntoo scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine,\nand if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt’s, lady Hsüeh’s\nhouse, there’s no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, that\naunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact no\nright to come over here to see her?”",
        "Nurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard.\n\"Really,” she observed, “every remark this girl Lin utters is sharper\nthan a razor! I didn’t say anything much!”",
        "Pao Ch’ai too could not suppress a smile, and as she pinched Tai-yü’s\ncheek, she exclaimed, “Oh the tongue of this frowning girl! one can\nneither resent what it says, nor yet listen to it with any\ngratification!”",
        "“Don’t be afraid!” Mrs. Hsüeh went on to say, “don’t be afraid; my son,\nyou’ve come to see me, and although I’ve nothing good to give you, you\nmustn’t, through fright, let the trifle you’ve taken lie heavy on your\nstomach, and thus make me uneasy; but just drink at your pleasure, and\nas much as you like, and let the blame fall on my shoulders. What’s\nmore, you can stay to dinner with me, and then go home; or if you do get\ntipsy, you can sleep with me, that’s all.”",
        "She thereupon told the servants to heat some more wine. “I’ll come,” she\ncontinued, “and keep you company while you have two or three cups, after\r\nwhich we’ll have something to eat!”",
        "It was only after these assurances that Pao-yü’s spirits began at\nlength, once more to revive, and dame Li then directed the waiting-maids\nwhat to do. “You remain here,” she enjoined, “and mind, be diligent\nwhile I go home and change; when I’ll come back again. Don’t allow him,\"\nshe also whispered to “aunt” Hsüeh, “to have all his own way and drink\ntoo much.”",
        "Having said this, she betook herself back to her quarters; and during\nthis while, though there were two or three nurses in attendance, they\ndid not concern themselves with what was going on. As soon as they saw\nthat nurse Li had left, they likewise all quietly slipped out, at the\nfirst opportunity they found, while there remained but two\nwaiting-maids, who were only too glad to curry favour with Pao-yü. But\nfortunately “aunt” Hsüeh, by much coaxing and persuading, only let him\nhave a few cups, and the wine being then promptly cleared away, pickled\nbamboo shoots and chicken-skin soup were prepared, of which Pao-yü drank\nwith relish several bowls full, eating besides more than half a bowl of\nfinest rice congee.",
        "By this time, Hsüeh Pao Ch’ai and Lin Tai-yü had also finished their\nrepast; and when Pao-yü had drunk a few cups of strong tea, Mrs. Hsüeh\nfelt more easy in her mind. Hsüeh Yen and the others, three or four of\nthem in all, had also had their meal, and came in to wait upon them.",
        "“Are you now going or not?” inquired Tai-yü of Pao-yü.",
        "Pao-yü looked askance with his drowsy eyes. “If you want to go,” he\nobserved, “I’ll go with you.”",
        "Tai-yü hearing this, speedily rose. “We’ve been here nearly the whole\nday,” she said, “and ought to be going back.”",
        "As she spoke the two of them bade good-bye, and the waiting-maids at\nonce presented a hood to each of them.",
        "Pao-yü readily lowered his head slightly and told a waiting-maid to put\nit on. The girl promptly took the hood, made of deep red cloth, and\nshaking it out of its folds, she put it on Pao-yü’s head.",
        "“That will do,” hastily exclaimed Pao-yü. “You stupid thing! gently a\nbit; is it likely you’ve never seen any one put one on before? let me do\nit myself.”",
        "“Come over here, and I’ll put it on for you,” suggested Tai-yü, as she\nstood on the edge of the couch. Pao-yü eagerly approached her, and\nTai-yü carefully kept the cap, to which his hair was bound, fast down,\nand taking the hood she rested its edge on the circlet round his\nforehead. She then raised the ball of crimson velvet, which was as large\nas a walnut, and put it in such a way that, as it waved tremulously, it\nshould appear outside the hood. These arrangements completed she cast a\nlook for a while at what she had done. “That’s right now,” she added,\n\"throw your wrapper over you!”",
        "When Pao-yü caught these words, he eventually took the wrapper and threw\nit over his shoulders.",
        "“None of your nurses,” hurriedly interposed aunt Hsüeh, “are yet come,\nso you had better wait a while.”",
        "“Why should we wait for them?” observed Pao-yü. “We have the\nwaiting-maids to escort us, and surely they should be enough.”",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh finding it difficult to set her mind at ease deputed two\nmarried women to accompany the two cousins; and after they had both\nexpressed (to these women) their regret at having troubled them, they\ncame straightway to dowager lady Chia’s suite of apartments.",
        "Her venerable ladyship had not, as yet, had her evening repast. Hearing\nthat they had been at Mrs. Hsüeh’s, she was extremely pleased; but\nnoticing that Pao-yü had had some wine, she gave orders that he should\nbe taken to his room, and put to bed, and not be allowed to come out\nagain.",
        "“Do take good care of him,” she therefore enjoined the servants, and\nwhen suddenly she bethought herself of Pao-yü’s attendants, “How is it,\"\nshe at once inquired of them all, “that I don’t see nurse Li here?”",
        "They did not venture to tell her the truth, that she had gone home, but\r\r\nsimply explained that she had come in a few moments back, and that they\nthought she must have again gone out on some business or other.",
        "“She’s better off than your venerable ladyship,” remarked Pao-yü,\nturning round and swaying from side to side. “Why then ask after her?\nWere I rid of her, I believe I might live a little longer.”",
        "While uttering these words, he reached the door of his bedroom, where he\nsaw pen and ink laid out on the writing table.",
        "“That’s nice,” exclaimed Ch’ing Wen, as she came to meet him with a\nsmile on her face, “you tell me to prepare the ink for you, but though\nwhen you get up, you were full of the idea of writing, you only wrote\nthree characters, when you discarded the pencil, and ran away, fooling\nme, by making me wait the whole day! Come now at once and exhaust all\nthis ink before you’re let off.”",
        "Pao-yü then remembered what had taken place in the morning. “Where are\nthe three characters I wrote?” he consequently inquired, smiling.",
        "“Why this man is tipsy,” remarked Ch’ing Wen sneeringly. “As you were\ngoing to the other mansion, you told me to stick them over the door. I\nwas afraid lest any one else should spoil them, as they were being\npasted, so I climbed up a high ladder and was ever so long in putting\nthem up myself; my hands are even now numb with cold.”",
        "“Oh I forgot all about it,” replied Pao-yü grinning, “if your hands are\ncold, come and I’ll rub them warm for you.”",
        "Promptly stretching out his hand, he took those of Ch’ing Wen in his,\nand the two of them looked at the three characters, which he recently\nhad written, and which were pasted above the door. In a short while,\nTai-yü came.",
        "“My dear cousin,” Pao-yü said to her smilingly, “tell me without any\nprevarication which of the three characters is the best written?”",
        "Tai-yü raised her head and perceived the three characters: Red, Rue,\nHall. “They’re all well done,” she rejoined, with a smirk, “How is it\nyou’ve written them so well? By and bye you must also write a tablet for\nme.”",
        "“Are you again making fun of me?” asked Pao-yü smiling; “what about\nsister Hsi Jen?” he went on to inquire.",
        "Ch’ing Wen pouted her lips, pointing towards the stove-couch in the\ninner room, and, on looking in, Pao-yü espied Hsi Jen fast asleep in her\ndaily costume.",
        "“Well,” Pao-yü observed laughing, “there’s no harm in it, but its rather\nearly to sleep. When I was having my early meal, on the other side,” he\nproceeded, speaking to Ch’ing Wen, “there was a small dish of dumplings,\nwith bean-curd outside; and as I thought you would like to have some, I\nasked Mrs. Yu for them, telling her that I would keep them, and eat them\nin the evening; I told some one to bring them over, but have you\nperchance seen them?”",
        "“Be quick and drop that subject,” suggested Ch’ing Wen; “as soon as they\nwere brought over, I at once knew they were intended for me; as I had\njust finished my meal, I put them by in there, but when nurse Li came\nshe saw them. ’Pao-yü,’ she said, ’is not likely to eat them, so I’ll\ntake them and give them to my grandson.’ And forthwith she bade some one\ntake them over to her home.”",
        "While she was speaking, Hsi Hsüeh brought in tea, and Pao-yü pressed his\ncousin Lin to have a cup.",
        "“Miss Lin has gone long ago,” observed all of them, as they burst out\nlaughing, “and do you offer her tea?”",
        "Pao-yü drank about half a cup, when he also suddenly bethought himself\nof some tea, which had been brewed in the morning. “This morning,” he\ntherefore inquired of Hsi Hsüeh, “when you made a cup of maple-dew tea,\nI told you that that kind of tea requires brewing three or four times\nbefore its colour appears; and how is that you now again bring me this\ntea?”",
        "“I did really put it by,” answered Hsi Hsüeh, “but nurse Li came and\ndrank it, and then went off.”",
        "Pao-yü upon hearing this, dashed the cup he held in his hand on the\nground, and as it broke into small fragments, with a crash, it spattered\nHsi Hsüeh’s petticoat all over.",
        "“Of whose family is she the mistress?” inquired Pao-yü of Hsi Hsüeh, as\nhe jumped up, “that you all pay such deference to her. I just simply had\na little of her milk, when I was a brat, and that’s all; and now she has\ngot into the way of thinking herself more high and mighty than even the\nheads of the family! She should be packed off, and then we shall all\nhave peace and quiet.”",
        "Saying this, he was bent upon going, there and then, to tell dowager\nlady Chia to have his nurse driven away.",
        "Hsi Jen was really not asleep, but simply feigning, with the idea, when\nPao-yü came, to startle him in play. At first, when she heard him speak\nof writing, and inquire after the dumplings, she did not think it\nnecessary to get up, but when he flung the tea-cup on the floor, and got\ninto a temper, she promptly jumped up and tried to appease him, and to\nprevent him by coaxing from carrying out his threat.",
        "A waiting-maid sent by dowager lady Chia came in, meanwhile, to ask what\nwas the matter.",
        "“I had just gone to pour tea,” replied Hsi Jen, without the least\nhesitation, “and I slipped on the snow and fell, while the cup dropped\nfrom my hand and broke. Your decision to send her away is good,” she\nwent on to advise Pao-yü, “and we are all willing to go also; and why\nnot avail yourself of this opportunity to dismiss us in a body? It will\nbe for our good, and you too on the other hand, needn’t perplex yourself\nabout not getting better people to come and wait on you!”",
        "When Pao-yü heard this taunt, he had at length not a word to say, and\nsupported by Hsi Jen and the other attendants on to the couch, they\ndivested him of his clothes. But they failed to understand the drift of\nwhat Pao-yü kept on still muttering, and all they could make out was an\nendless string of words; but his eyes grew heavier and drowsier, and\nthey forthwith waited upon him until he went to sleep; when Hsi Jen\nunclasped the jade of spiritual perception, and rolling it up in a\nhandkerchief, she lay it under the mattress, with the idea that when he\nput it on the next day it should not chill his neck.",
        "Pao-yü fell sound asleep the moment he lay his head on the pillow. By\nthis time nurse Li and the others had come in, but when they heard that\nPao-yü was tipsy, they too did not venture to approach, but gently made\ninquiries as to whether he was asleep or not. On hearing that he was,\nthey took their departure with their minds more at ease.",
        "The next morning the moment Pao-yü awoke, some one came in to tell him\nthat young Mr. Jung, living in the mansion on the other side, had\nbrought Ch’in Chung to pay him a visit.",
        "Pao-yü speedily went out to greet them and to take them over to pay\ntheir respects to dowager lady Chia. Her venerable ladyship upon\nperceiving that Ch’in Chung, with his handsome countenance, and his\nrefined manners, would be a fit companion for Pao-yü in his studies,\nfelt extremely delighted at heart; and having readily detained him to\ntea, and kept him to dinner, she went further and directed a servant to\nescort him to see madame Wang and the rest of the family.",
        "With the fond regard of the whole household for Mrs. Ch’in, they were,\nwhen they saw what a kind of person Ch’in Chung was, so enchanted with\nhim, that at the time of his departure, they all had presents to give\nhim; even dowager lady Chia herself presented him with a purse and a\ngolden image of the God of Learning, with a view that it should incite\nhim to study and harmony.",
        "“Your house,” she further advised him, “is far off, and when it’s cold\nor hot, it would be inconvenient for you to come all that way, so you\nhad better come and live over here with me. You’ll then be always with\nyour cousin Pao-yü, and you won’t be together, in your studies, with\nthose fellow-pupils of yours who have no idea what progress means.”",
        "Ch’in Chung made a suitable answer to each one of her remarks, and on\r\nhis return home he told everything to his father.",
        "His father, Ch’in Pang-yeh, held at present the post of Secretary in the\nPeking Field Force, and was well-nigh seventy. His wife had died at an\nearly period, and as she left no issue, he adopted a son and a daughter\nfrom a foundling asylum.",
        "But who would have thought it, the boy also died, and there only\nremained the girl, known as Kó Ch’ing in her infancy, who when she grew\nup, was beautiful in face and graceful in manners, and who by reason of\nsome relationship with the Chia family, was consequently united by the\nties of marriage (to one of the household).",
        "Ch’in Pang-yeh was in his fiftieth year when he at length got this son.\nAs his tutor had the previous year left to go south, he remained at home\nkeeping up his former lessons; and (his father) had been just thinking\nof talking over the matter with his relatives of the Chia family, and\nsending his son to the private school, when, as luck would have it, this\nopportunity of meeting Pao-yü presented itself.",
        "Knowing besides that the family school was under the direction of the\nvenerable scholar Chia Tai-ju, and hoping that by joining his class,\n(his son) might advance in knowledge and by these means reap reputation,\nhe was therefore intensely gratified. The only drawbacks were that his\nofficial emoluments were scanty, and that both the eyes of everyone in\nthe other establishment were set upon riches and honours, so that he\ncould not contribute anything short of the amount (given by others); but\nhis son’s welfare throughout life was a serious consideration, and he,\nneedless to say, had to scrape together from the East and to collect\nfrom the West; and making a parcel, with all deference, of twenty-four\ntaels for an introduction present, he came along with Ch’in Chung to\nTai-ju’s house to pay their respects. But he had to wait subsequently\nuntil Pao-yü could fix on an auspicious date on which they could\ntogether enter the school.",
        "As for what happened after they came to school, the next chapter will\ndivulge.",
        "  Chia Cheng gives good advice to his wayward son.\n  Li Kuei receives a reprimand.\n  Chia Jui and Li Kuei rebuke the obstinate youths!\n  Ming Yen causes trouble in the school-room.",
        "But to return to our story. Mr. Ch’in, the father, and Ch’in Chung, his\nson, only waited until the receipt, by the hands of a servant, of a\nletter from the Chia family about the date on which they were to go to\nschool. Indeed, Pao-yü was only too impatient that he and Ch’in Chung\nshould come together, and, without loss of time, he fixed upon two days\nlater as the day upon which they were definitely to begin their studies,\nand he despatched a servant with a letter to this effect.",
        "On the day appointed, as soon as it was daylight, Pao-yü turned out of\nbed. Hsi Jen had already by that time got books, pencils and all writing\nnecessaries in perfect readiness, and was sitting on the edge of the bed\nin a moping mood; but as soon as she saw Pao-yü approach, she was\nconstrained to wait upon him in his toilette and ablutions.",
        "Pao-yü, noticing how despondent she was, made it a point to address her.\n\"My dear sister,” he said, “how is it you aren’t again yourself? Is it\nlikely that you bear me a grudge for being about to go to school,\nbecause when I leave you, you’ll all feel dull?”",
        "Hsi Jen smiled. “What an ideal” she replied. “Study is a most excellent\nthing, and without it a whole lifetime is a mere waste, and what good\ncomes in the long run? There’s only one thing, which is simply that when\nengaged in reading your books, you should set your mind on your books;\nand that you should think of home when not engaged in reading. Whatever\nyou do, don’t romp together with them, for were you to meet our master,\nyour father, it will be no joke! Although it’s asserted that a scholar\nmust strain every nerve to excel, yet it’s preferable that the tasks\nshould be somewhat fewer, as, in the first place, when one eats too\nmuch, one cannot digest it; and, in the second place, good health must\nalso be carefully attended to. This is my view on the subject, and you\nshould at all times consider it in practice.”",
        "While Hsi Jen gave utterance to a sentence, Pao-yü nodded his head in\nsign of approval of that sentence. Hsi Jen then went on to speak. “I’ve\nalso packed up,” she continued, “your long pelisse, and handed it to the\npages to take it over; so mind, when it’s cold in the school-room,\nplease remember to put on this extra clothing, for it’s not like home,\nwhere you have people to look after you. The foot-stove and hand-stove,\nI’ve also sent over; and urge that pack of lazy-bones to attend to their\nwork, for if you say nothing, they will be so engrossed in their\nfrolics, that they’ll be loth to move, and let you, all for nothing,\ntake a chill and ruin your constitution.”",
        "“Compose your mind,” replied Pao-yü; “when I go out, I know well enough\nhow to attend to everything my own self. But you people shouldn’t remain\nin this room, and mope yourselves to death; and it would be well if you\nwould often go over to cousin Lin’s for a romp.”",
        "While saying this, he had completed his toilette, and Hsi Jen pressed\nhim to go and wish good morning to dowager lady Chia, Chia Cheng, madame\nWang, and the other members of the family.",
        "Pao-yü, after having gone on to give a few orders to Ch’ing Wen and She\nYueh, at length left his apartments, and coming over, paid his obeisance\nto dowager lady Chia. Her venerable Ladyship had likewise, as a matter\nof course, a few recommendations to make to him, which ended, he next\nwent and greeted madame Wang; and leaving again her quarters, he came\ninto the library to wish Chia Cheng good morning.",
        "As it happened, Chia Cheng had on this day returned home at an early\nhour, and was, at this moment, in the library, engaged in a friendly\nchat with a few gentlemen, who were family companions. Suddenly\nperceiving Pao-yü come in to pay his respects, and report that he was\nabout to go to school, Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. “If you do\nagain,” he remarked, “make allusions to the words going to school,\nyou’ll make even me blush to death with shame! My advice to you is that\nyou should after all go your own way and play; that’s the best thing for\nyou; and mind you don’t pollute with dirt this floor by standing here,\nand soil this door of mine by leaning against it!”",
        "The family companions stood up and smilingly expostulated.",
        "“Venerable Sir,” they pleaded, “why need you be so down upon him? Our\nworthy brother is this day going to school, and may in two or three\nyears be able to display his abilities and establish his reputation. He\nwill, beyond doubt, not behave like a child, as he did in years gone\npast. But as the time for breakfast is also drawing nigh, you should,\nworthy brother, go at once.”",
        "When these words had been spoken, two among them, who were advanced in\nyears, readily took Pao-yü by the hand, and led him out of the library.",
        "“Who are in attendance upon Pao-yü?” Chia Cheng having inquired, he\nheard a suitable reply, “We, Sir!” given from outside; and three or four\nsturdy fellows entered at an early period and fell on one knee, and\nbowed and paid their obeisance.",
        "When Chia Cheng came to scrutinise who they were, and he recognised Li\nKuei, the son of Pao-yü’s nurse, he addressed himself to him. “You\npeople,” he said, “remain waiting upon him the whole day long at school,\nbut what books has he after all read? Books indeed! why, he has read and\nfilled his brains with a lot of trashy words and nonsensical phrases,\nand learnt some ingenious way of waywardness. Wait till I have a little\nleisure, and I’ll set to work, first and foremost, and flay your skin\noff, and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing!”",
        "This threat so terrified Li Kuei that he hastily fell on both his knees,\npulled off his hat, knocked his head on the ground, and gave vent to\nrepeated assenting utterances: “Oh, quite so, Sir! Our elder brother Mr.\nPao has,” he continued, “already read up to the third book of the Book\nof Odes, up to where there’s something or other like: ’Yiu, Yiu, the\ndeer bleat; the lotus leaves and duckweed.’ Your servant wouldn’t\npresume to tell a lie!”",
        "As he said this, the whole company burst out into a boisterous fit of\nlaughter, and Chia Cheng himself could not also contain his countenance\nand had to laugh. “Were he even,” he observed, “to read thirty books of\nthe Book of Odes, it would be as much an imposition upon people and no\nmore, as (when the thief) who, in order to steal the bell, stops up his\nown ears! You go and present my compliments to the gentleman in the\nschoolroom, and tell him, from my part, that the whole lot of Odes and\nold writings are of no use, as they are subjects for empty show; and\nthat he should, above all things, take the Four Books, and explain them\nto him, from first to last, and make him know them all thoroughly by\nheart,–that this is the most important thing!”",
        "Li Kuei signified his obedience with all promptitude, and perceiving\nthat Chia Cheng had nothing more to say, he retired out of the room.",
        "During this while, Pao-yü had been standing all alone outside in the\ncourt, waiting quietly with suppressed voice, and when they came out he\nat once walked away in their company.",
        "Li Kuei and his companions observed as they shook their clothes, “Did\nyou, worthy brother, hear what he said that he would first of all flay\nour skins off! People’s servants acquire some respectability from the\nmaster whom they serve, but we poor fellows fruitlessly wait upon you,\nand are beaten and blown up in the bargain. It would be well if we were,\nfrom henceforward, to be treated with a certain amount of regard.”",
        "Pao-yü smiled, “Dear Brother,” he added, “don’t feel aggrieved; I’ll\ninvite you to come round to-morrow!”",
        "“My young ancestor,” replied Li Kuei, “who presumes to look forward to\nan invitation? all I entreat you is to listen to one or two words I have\nto say, that’s all.”",
        "As they talked they came over once more to dowager lady Chia’s on this\nside.",
        "Ch’in Chung had already arrived, and the old lady was first having a\nchat with him. Forthwith the two of them exchanged salutations, and took\nleave of her ladyship; but Pao-yü, suddenly remembering that he had not\nsaid good-bye to Tai-yü, promptly betook himself again to Tai-yü’s\nquarters to do so.",
        "Tai-yü was, at this time, below the window, facing the mirror, and\nadjusting her toilette. Upon hearing Pao-yü mention that he was on his\nway to school, she smiled and remarked, “That’s right! you’re now going\nto school and you’ll be sure to reach the lunar palace and pluck the\nolea fragrans; but I can’t go along with you.”",
        "“My dear cousin,” rejoined Pao-yü, “wait for me to come out from school,\nbefore you have your evening meal; wait also until I come to prepare the\r\ncosmetic of rouge.”",
        "After a protracted chat, he at length tore himself away and took his\ndeparture.",
        "“How is it,” interposed Tai-yü, as she once again called out to him and\nstopped him, “that you don’t go and bid farewell to your cousin Pao\nCh’ai?”",
        "Pao-yü smiled, and saying not a word by way of reply he straightway\nwalked to school, accompanied by Ch’in Chung.",
        "This public school, which it must be noticed was also not far from his\nquarters, had been originally instituted by the founder of the\nestablishment, with the idea that should there be among the young\nfellows of his clan any who had not the means to engage a tutor, they\nshould readily be able to enter this class for the prosecution of their\nstudies; that all those of the family who held official position should\nall give (the institution) pecuniary assistance, with a view to meet the\r\nexpenses necessary for allowances to the students; and that they were to\nselect men advanced in years and possessed of virtue to act as tutors of\nthe family school.",
        "The two of them, Ch’in Chung and Pao-yü, had now entered the class, and\nafter they and the whole number of their schoolmates had made each\nother’s acquaintance, their studies were commenced. Ever since this\ntime, these two were wont to come together, go together, get up\ntogether, and sit together, till they became more intimate and close.\nBesides, dowager lady Chia got very fond of Ch’in Chung, and would again\nand again keep him to stay with them for three and five days at a time,\ntreating him as if he were one of her own great-grandsons. Perceiving\nthat in Ch’in Chung’s home there was not much in the way of sufficiency,\nshe also helped him in clothes and other necessaries; and scarcely had\none or two months elapsed before Ch’in Chung got on friendly terms with\nevery one in the Jung mansion.",
        "Pao-yü was, however, a human being who could not practise contentment\nand observe propriety; and as his sole delight was to have every caprice\ngratified, he naturally developed a craving disposition. “We two, you\nand I, are,” he was also wont secretly to tell Ch’in Chung, “of the same\nage, and fellow-scholars besides, so that there’s no need in the future\nto pay any regard to our relationship of uncle and nephew; and we should\ntreat each other as brothers or friends, that’s all.”",
        "Ch’in Chung at first (explained that) he could not be so presumptuous;\nbut as Pao-yü would not listen to any such thing, but went on to address\nhim as brother and to call him by his style Ch’ing Ch’ing, he had\nlikewise himself no help, but to begin calling him, at random, anything\nand anyhow.",
        "There were, it is true, a large number of pupils in this school, but\nthese consisted of the sons and younger brothers of that same clan, and\nof several sons and nephews of family connections. The proverb\nappositely describes that there are nine species of dragons, and that\neach species differs; and it goes of course without saying that in a\r\nlarge number of human beings there were dragons and snakes, confusedly\nadmixed, and that creatures of a low standing were included.",
        "Ever since the arrival of the two young fellows, Ch’in Chung and Pao-yü,\nboth of whom were in appearance as handsome as budding flowers, and\nthey, on the one hand, saw how modest and genial Ch’in Chung was, how he\nblushed before he uttered a word, how he was timid and demure like a\ngirl, and on the other hand, how that Pao-yü was naturally proficient in\nabasing and demeaning himself, how he was so affable and good-natured,\nconsiderate in his temperament and so full of conversation, and how that\nthese two were, in consequence, on such terms of intimate friendship, it\nwas, in fact, no matter of surprise that the whole company of\nfellow-students began to foster envious thoughts, that they, behind\ntheir backs, passed on their account, this one one disparaging remark\nand that one another, and that they insinuated slanderous lies against\nthem, which extended inside as well as outside the school-room.",
        "Indeed, after Hsüeh P’an had come over to take up his quarters in madame\nWang’s suite of apartments, he shortly came to hear of the existence of\na family school, and that this school was mainly attended by young\nfellows of tender years, and inordinate ideas were suddenly aroused in\nhim. While he therefore fictitiously gave out that he went to school,\n[he was as irregular in his attendance as the fisherman] who catches\nfish for three days, and suns his nets for the next two; simply\npresenting his school-fee gift to Chia Tai-jui and making not the least\nprogress in his studies; his sole dream being to knit a number of\nfamiliar friendships. Who would have thought it, there were in this\nschool young pupils, who, in their greed to obtain money, clothes and\neatables from Hsüeh P’an, allowed themselves to be cajoled by him, and\nplayed tricks upon; but on this topic, it is likewise superfluous to\ndilate at any length.",
        "There were also two lovable young scholars, relatives of what branch of\nthe family is not known, and whose real surnames and names have also not\nbeen ascertained, who, by reason of their good and winsome looks, were,\nby the pupils in the whole class, given two nicknames, to one that of\n\"Hsiang Lin,” “Fragrant Love,” and to the other “Yü Ai,” “Precious\nAffection.” But although every one entertained feelings of secret\nadmiration for them, and had the wish to take liberties with the young\nfellows, they lived, nevertheless, one and all, in such terror of Hsüeh\nP’an’s imperious influence, that they had not the courage to come\nforward and interfere with them.",
        "As soon as Ch’in Chung and Pao-yü had, at this time, come to school, and\nthey had made the acquaintance of these two fellow-pupils, they too\ncould not help becoming attached to them and admiring them, but as they\nalso came to know that they were great friends of Hsüeh P’an, they did\nnot, in consequence, venture to treat them lightly, or to be unseemly in\ntheir behaviour towards them. Hsiang Lin and Yü Ai both kept to\nthemselves the same feelings, which they fostered for Ch’in Chung and\nPao-yü, and to this reason is to be assigned the fact that though these\nfour persons nurtured fond thoughts in their hearts there was however no\nvisible sign of them. Day after day, each one of them would, during\nschool hours, sit in four distinct places: but their eight eyes were\nsecretly linked together; and, while indulging either in innuendoes or\nin double entendres, their hearts, in spite of the distance between\nthem, reflected the whole number of their thoughts.",
        "But though their outward attempts were devoted to evade the detection of\nother people’s eyes, it happened again that, while least expected,\nseveral sly lads discovered the real state of affairs, with the result\nthat the whole school stealthily frowned their eyebrows at them, winked\ntheir eyes at them, or coughed at them, or raised their voices at them;\nand these proceedings were, in fact, not restricted to one single day.",
        "As luck would have it, on this day Tai-jui was, on account of business,\ncompelled to go home; and having left them as a task no more than a\nheptameter line for an antithetical couplet, explaining that they should\nfind a sentence to rhyme, and that the following day when he came back,\nhe would set them their lessons, he went on to hand the affairs\nconnected with the class to his elder grandson, Chia Jui, whom he asked\nto take charge.",
        "Wonderful to say Hsüeh P’an had of late not frequented school very\noften, not even so much as to answer the roll, so that Ch’in Chung\navailed himself of his absence to ogle and smirk with Hsiang Lin; and\nthese two pretending that they had to go out, came into the back court\nfor a chat.",
        "“Does your worthy father at home mind your having any friends?” Ch’in\nChung was the first to ask. But this sentence was scarcely ended, when\nthey heard a sound of coughing coming from behind. Both were taken much\naback, and, speedily turning their heads round to see, they found that\nit was a fellow-scholar of theirs, called Chin Jung.",
        "Hsiang Lin was naturally of somewhat hasty temperament, so that with\nshame and anger mutually impelling each other, he inquired of him,\n\"What’s there to cough at? Is it likely you wouldn’t have us speak to\neach other?”",
        "“I don’t mind your speaking,” Chin Jung observed laughing; “but would\nyou perchance not have me cough? I’ll tell you what, however; if you\nhave anything to say, why not utter it in intelligible language? Were\nyou allowed to go on in this mysterious manner, what strange doings\nwould you be up to? But I have sure enough found you out, so what’s the\nneed of still prevaricating? But if you will, first of all, let me\npartake of a share in your little game, you and I can hold our tongue\nand utter not a word. If not, why the whole school will begin to turn\nthe matter over.”",
        "At these words, Ch’in Chung and Hsiang Lin were so exasperated that\ntheir blood rushed up to their faces. “What have you found out?” they\nhastily asked.",
        "“What I have now detected,” replied Chin Jung smiling, “is the plain\ntruth!” and saying this he went on to clap his hands and to call out\nwith a loud voice as he laughed: “They have moulded some nice well-baked\ncakes, won’t you fellows come and buy one to eat!” (These two have been\nup to larks, won’t you come and have some fun!)",
        "Both Ch’in Chung and Hsiang Lin felt resentful as well as fuming with\nrage, and with hurried step they went in, in search of Chia Jui, to whom\nthey reported Chin Jung, explaining that Chin Jung had insulted them\nboth, without any rhyme or reason.",
        "The fact is that this Chia Jui was, in an extraordinary degree, a man\nwith an eye to the main chance, and devoid of any sense of propriety.\nHis wont was at school to take advantage of public matters to serve his\nprivate interest, and to bring pressure upon his pupils with the intent\nthat they should regale him. While subsequently he also lent his\ncountenance to Hsüeh P’an, scheming to get some money or eatables out of\nhim, he left him entirely free to indulge in disorderly behaviour; and\nnot only did he not go out of his way to hold him in check, but, on the\ncontrary, he encouraged him, infamous though he was already, to become a\nbully, so as to curry favour with him.",
        "But this Hsüeh P’an was, by nature, gifted with a fickle disposition;\nto-day, he would incline to the east, and to-morrow to the west, so that\nhaving recently obtained new friends, he put Hsiang Lin and Yü Ai aside.\nChin Jung too was at one time an intimate friend of his, but ever since\nhe had acquired the friendship of the two lads, Hsiang Lin and Yü Ai, he\nforthwith deposed Chin Jung. Of late, he had already come to look down\nupon even Hsiang Lin and Yü Ai, with the result that Chia Jui as well\nwas deprived of those who could lend him support, or stand by him; but\nhe bore Hsüeh P’an no grudge, for wearying with old friends, as soon as\nhe found new ones, but felt angry that Hsiang Lin and Yü Ai had not put\nin a word on his behalf with Hsüeh P’an. Chia Jui, Chin Jung and in fact\nthe whole crowd of them were, for this reason, just harbouring a jealous\ngrudge against these two, so that when he saw Ch’in Chung and Hsiang Lin\ncome on this occasion and lodge a complaint against Chin Jung, Chia Jui\nreadily felt displeasure creep into his heart; and, although he did not\nventure to call Ch’in Chung to account, he nevertheless made an example\nof Hsiang Lin. And instead (of taking his part), he called him a\nbusybody and denounced him in much abusive language, with the result\nthat Hsiang Lin did not, contrariwise, profit in any way, but brought\ndispleasure upon himself. Even Ch’in Chung grumbled against the\ntreatment, as each of them resumed their places.",
        "Chin Jung became still more haughty, and wagging his head and smacking\nhis lips, he gave vent to many more abusive epithets; but as it happened\nthat they also reached Yü Ai’s ears, the two of them, though seated\napart, began an altercation in a loud tone of voice.",
        "Chin Jung, with obstinate pertinacity, clung to his version. “Just a\nshort while back,” he said, “I actually came upon them, as they were\nindulging in demonstrations of intimate friendship in the back court.\nThese two had resolved to be one in close friendship, and were eloquent\nin their protestations, mindful only in persistently talking their\ntrash, but they were not aware of the presence of another person.”",
        "But his language had, contrary to all expectations, given, from the very\nfirst, umbrage to another person, and who do you, (gentle reader,)\nimagine this person to have been?",
        "This person was, in fact, one whose name was Chia Se; a grandson\nlikewise of a main branch of the Ning mansion. His parents had died at\nan early period, and he had, ever since his youth, lived with Chia Chen.\r\nHe had at this time grown to be sixteen years of age, and was, as\ncompared with Chia Jung, still more handsome and good looking. These two\ncousins were united by ties of the closest intimacy, and were always\ntogether, whether they went out or stayed at home.",
        "The inmates of the Ning mansion were many in number, and their opinions\nof a mixed kind; and that whole bevy of servants, devoid as they were of\nall sense of right, solely excelled in the practice of inventing stories\nto backbite their masters; and this is how some mean person or other\nagain, who it was is not known, insinuated slanderous and opprobrious\nreports (against Chia Se). Chia Chen had, presumably, also come to hear\nsome unfavourable criticisms (on his account), and having, of course, to\nsave himself from odium and suspicion, he had, at this juncture, after\nall, to apportion him separate quarters, and to bid Chia Se move outside\nthe Ning mansion, where he went and established a home of his own to\nlive in.",
        "This Chia Se was handsome as far as external appearances went, and\nintelligent withal in his inward natural gifts, but, though he nominally\ncame to school, it was simply however as a mere blind; for he treated,\nas he had ever done, as legitimate occupations, such things as cock\nfighting, dog-racing and visiting places of easy virtue. And as, above,\nhe had Chia Chen to spoil him by over-indulgence; and below, there was\nChia Jung to stand by him, who of the clan could consequently presume to\nrun counter to him?",
        "Seeing that he was on the closest terms of friendship with Chia Jung,\nhow could he reconcile himself to the harsh treatment which he now saw\nCh’in Chung receive from some persons? Being now bent upon pushing\nhimself forward to revenge the injustice, he was, for the time, giving\nhimself up to communing with his own heart. “Chin Jung, Chia Jui and the\nrest are,” he pondered, “friends of uncle Hsüeh, but I too am on\nfriendly terms with him, and he with me, and if I do come forward and\nthey tell old Hsüeh, won’t we impair the harmony which exists between\nus? and if I don’t concern myself, such idle tales make, when spoken,\nevery one feel uncomfortable; and why shouldn’t I now devise some means\nto hold them in check, so as to stop their mouths, and prevent any loss\nof face!”",
        "Having concluded this train of thought, he also pretended that he had to\ngo out, and, walking as far as the back, he, with low voice, called to\nhis side Ming Yen, the page attending upon Pao-yü in his studies, and in\none way and another, he made use of several remarks to egg him on.",
        "This Ming Yen was the smartest of Pao-yü’s attendants, but he was also\nyoung in years and lacked experience, so that he lent a patient ear to\nwhat Chia Se had to say about the way Chin Jung had insulted Ch’in\nChung. “Even your own master, Pao-yü,” (Chia Se added), “is involved,\nand if you don’t let him know a bit of your mind, he will next time be\nstill more arrogant.”",
        "This Ming Yen was always ready, even with no valid excuse, to be\ninsolent and overbearing to people, so that after hearing the news and\nbeing furthermore instigated by Chia Se, he speedily rushed into the\nschoolroom and cried out “Chin Jung;” nor did he address him as Mr.\nChin, but merely shouted “What kind of fellow is this called Chin?”",
        "Chia Se presently shuffled his feet, while he designedly adjusted his\ndress and looked at the rays of the sun. “It’s time,” he observed and\nwalking forthwith, first up to Chia Jui, he explained to him that he had\nsomething to attend to and would like to get away a little early; and as\nChia Jui did not venture to stop him, he had no alternative but to let\nhim have his way and go.",
        "During this while, Ming Yen had entered the room and promptly seizing\nChin Jung in a grip: “What we do, whether proper or improper,” he said,\n\"doesn’t concern you! It’s enough anyway that we don’t defile your\nfather! A fine brat you are indeed, to come out and meddle with your Mr.\nMing!”",
        "These words plunged the scholars of the whole class in such\nconsternation that they all wistfully and absently looked at him.",
        "“Ming Yen,” hastily shouted out Chia Jui, “you’re not to kick up a\nrumpus.”",
        "Chin Jung was so full of anger that his face was quite yellow. “What a\nsubversion of propriety! a slave and a menial to venture to behave in\nthis manner! I’ll just simply speak to your master,” he exclaimed as he\nreadily pushed his hands off and was about to go and lay hold of Pao-yü\nto beat him.",
        "Ch’in Chung was on the point of turning round to leave the room, when\nwith a sound of ’whiff’ which reached him from behind, he at once caught\nsight of a square inkslab come flying that way. Who had thrown it he\ncould not say, but it struck the desk where Chia Lan and Chia Chün were\nseated.",
        "These two, Chia Lan and Chia Chün, were also the great-grandsons of a\nclose branch of the Jung mansion. This Chia Chün had been left\nfatherless at an early age, and his mother doated upon him in an unusual\nmanner, and it was because at school he was on most friendly terms with\nChia Lan, that these two sat together at the same desk. Who would have\nbelieved that Chia Chün would, in spite of being young in years, have\nhad an extremely strong mind, and that he would be mostly up to mischief\nwithout the least fear of any one. He watched with listless eye from his\nseat Chin Jung’s friends stealthily assist Chin Jung, as they flung an\ninkslab to strike Ming Yen, but when, as luck would have it, it hit the\nwrong mark, and fell just in front of him, smashing to atoms the\nporcelain inkslab and water bottle, and smudging his whole book with\nink, Chia Chün was, of course, much incensed, and hastily gave way to\nabuse. “You consummate pugnacious criminal rowdies! why, doesn’t this\namount to all of you taking a share in the fight!” And as he uttered\nthis abuse, he too forthwith seized an inkslab, which he was bent upon\nflinging.",
        "Chia Lan was one who always tried to avoid trouble, so that he lost no\ntime in pressing down the inkslab, while with all the words his mouth\ncould express, he tried to pacify him, adding “My dear brother, it’s no\nbusiness of yours and mine.”",
        "Chia Chün could not repress his resentment; and perceiving that the\ninkslab was held down, he at once laid hold of a box containing books,\nwhich he flung in this direction; but being, after all, short of\nstature, and weak of strength, he was unable to send it anywhere near\nthe mark; so that it dropped instead when it got as far as the desk\nbelonging to Pao-yü and Ch’in Chung, while a dreadful crash became\naudible as it fell smash on the table. The books, papers, pencils,\ninkslabs, and other writing materials were all scattered over the whole\ntable; and Pao-yü’s cup besides containing tea was itself broken to\npieces and the tea spilt.",
        "Chia Chün forthwith jumped forward with the intent of assailing the\nperson who had flung the inkslab at the very moment that Chin Jung took\nhold of a long bamboo pole which was near by; but as the space was\nlimited, and the pupils many, how could he very well brandish a long\nstick? Ming Yen at an early period received a whack, and he shouted\nwildly, “Don’t you fellows yet come to start a fight.”",
        "Pao-yü had, besides, along with him several pages, one of whom was\ncalled Sao Hung, another Ch’u Yo, another Mo Yü. These three were\nnaturally up to every mischief, so that with one voice, bawling\nboisterously, “You children of doubtful mothers, have you taken up\narms?” Mo Yü promptly took up the bar of a door; while Sao Hung and Ch’u\nYo both laid hold of horsewhips, and they all rushed forward like a hive\nof bees.",
        "Chia Jui was driven to a state of exasperation; now he kept this one in\ncheck, and the next moment he reasoned with another, but who would\nlisten to his words? They followed the bent of their inclinations and\nstirred up a serious disturbance.",
        "Of the whole company of wayward young fellows, some there were who gave\nsly blows for fun’s sake; others there were who were not gifted with\nmuch pluck and hid themselves on one side; there were those too who\nstood on the tables, clapping their hands and laughing immoderately,\nshouting out: “Go at it.”",
        "The row was, at this stage, like water bubbling over in a cauldron, when\nseveral elderly servants, like Li Kuei and others, who stood outside,\nheard the uproar commence inside, and one and all came in with all haste\nand united in their efforts to pacify them. Upon asking “What’s the\nmatter?” the whole bevy of voices shouted out different versions; this\none giving this account, while another again another story. But Li Kuei\ntemporised by rebuking Ming Yen and others, four in all, and packing\nthem off.",
        "Ch’in Chung’s head had, at an early period, come into contact with Chin\nJung’s pole and had had the skin grazed off. Pao-yü was in the act of\nrubbing it for him, with the overlap of his coat, but realising that the\nwhole lot of them had been hushed up, he forthwith bade Li Kuei collect\nhis books.",
        "“Bring my horse round,” he cried; “I’m going to tell Mr. Chia Tai-ju\nthat we have been insulted. I won’t venture to tell him anything else,\nbut (tell him I will) that having come with all propriety and made our\nreport to Mr. Chia Jui, Mr. Chia Jui instead (of helping us) threw the\nfault upon our shoulders. That while he heard people abuse us, he went\nso far as to instigate them to beat us; that Ming Yen seeing others\ninsult us, did naturally take our part; but that they, instead (of\ndesisting,) combined together and struck Ming Yen and even broke open\nCh’in Chung’s head. And that how is it possible for us to continue our\nstudies in here?”",
        "“My dear sir,” replied Li Kuei coaxingly, “don’t be so impatient! As Mr.\nChia Tai-ju has had something to attend to and gone home, were you now,\nfor a trifle like this, to go and disturb that aged gentleman, it will\nmake us, indeed, appear as if we had no sense of propriety: my idea is\nthat wherever a thing takes place, there should it be settled; and\nwhat’s the need of going and troubling an old man like him. This is all\nyou, Mr. Chia Jui, who is to blame; for in the absence of Mr. Chia\nTai-ju, you, sir, are the head in this school, and every one looks to\nyou to take action. Had all the pupils been at fault, those who deserved\na beating should have been beaten, and those who merited punishment\nshould have been punished! and why did you wait until things came to\nsuch a pass, and didn’t even exercise any check?”",
        "“I blew them up,” pleaded Chia Jui, “but not one of them would listen.”",
        "“I’ll speak out, whether you, worthy sir, resent what I’m going to say\nor not,” ventured Li Kuei. “It’s you, sir, who all along have after all\nhad considerable blame attached to your name; that’s why all these young\nmen wouldn’t hear you! Now if this affair is bruited, until it reaches\nMr. Chia Tai-ju’s ears, why even you, sir, will not be able to escape\ncondemnation; and why don’t you at once make up your mind to disentangle\nthe ravelled mess and dispel all trouble and have done with it!”",
        "“Disentangle what?” inquired Pao-yü; “I shall certainly go and make my\nreport.”",
        "“If Chin Jung stays here,” interposed Ch’in Chung sobbing, “I mean to go\nback home.”",
        "“Why that?” asked Pao-yü. “Is it likely that others can safely come and\nthat you and I can’t? I feel it my bounden duty to tell every one\neverything at home so as to expel Chin Jung. This Chin Jung,” he went on\nto inquire as he turned towards Lei Kuei, “is the relative or friend of\nwhat branch of the family?”",
        "Li Kuei gave way to reflection and then said by way of reply: “There’s\nno need whatever for you to raise this question; for were you to go and\nreport the matter to the branch of the family to which he belongs, the\nharmony which should exist between cousins will be still more impaired.”",
        "“He’s the nephew of Mrs. Huang, of the Eastern mansion,” interposed Ming\nYen from outside the window. “What a determined and self-confident\nfellow he must be to even come and bully us; Mrs. Huang is his paternal\naunt! That mother of yours is only good for tossing about like a\nmillstone, for kneeling before our lady Lien, and begging for something\nto pawn. I’ve no eye for such a specimen of mistress.”",
        "“What!” speedily shouted Li Kuei, “does this son of a dog happen to know\nof the existence of all these gnawing maggots?” (these disparaging\nfacts).",
        "Pao-yü gave a sardonic smile. “I was wondering whose relative he was,\"\nhe remarked; “is he really sister-in-law Huang’s nephew? well, I’ll go\nat once and speak to her.”",
        "As he uttered these words, his purpose was to start there and then, and\nhe called Ming Yen in, to come and pack up his books. Ming Yen walked in\nand put the books away. “Master,” he went on to suggest, in an exultant\nmanner, “there’s no need for you to go yourself to see her; I’ll go to\nher house and tell her that our old lady has something to ask of her. I\ncan hire a carriage to bring her over, and then, in the presence of her\nvenerable ladyship, she can be spoken to; and won’t this way save a lot\nof trouble?”",
        "“Do you want to die?” speedily shouted Li Kuei; “mind, when you go back,\nwhether right or wrong, I’ll first give you a good bumping, and then go\nand report you to our master and mistress, and just tell them that it’s\nyou, and only you, who instigated Mr. Pao-yü! I’ve succeeded, after ever\nso much trouble, in coaxing them, and mending matters to a certain\nextent, and now you come again to continue a new plan. It’s you who\nstirred up this row in the school-room; and not to speak of your\nfinding, as would have been the proper course, some way of suppressing\nit, there you are instead still jumping into the fire.”",
        "Ming Yen, at this juncture, could not muster the courage to utter a\nsound. By this time Chia Jui had also apprehended that if the row came\nto be beyond clearing up, he himself would likewise not be clear of\nblame, so that circumstances compelled him to pocket his grievances and\nto come and entreat Ch’in Chung as well as to make apologies to Pao-yü.\nThese two young fellows would not at first listen to his advances, but\nPao-yü at length explained that he would not go and report the\noccurrence, provided only Chin Jung admitted his being in the wrong.\nChin Jung refused, at the outset, to agree to this, but he ultimately\ncould find no way out of it, as Chia Jui himself urged him to make some\ntemporising apology.",
        "Li Kuei and the others felt compelled to tender Chin Jung some good\nadvice: “It’s you,” they said, “who have given rise to the disturbance,\nand if you don’t act in this manner, how will the matter ever be brought\nto an end?” so that Chin Jung found it difficult to persist in his\nobstinacy, and was constrained to make a bow to Ch’in Chung.",
        "Pao-yü was, however, not yet satisfied, but would insist upon his\nknocking his head on the ground, and Chia Jui, whose sole aim was to\ntemporarily smother the affair, quietly again urged Chin Jung, adding\nthat the proverb has it: “That if you keep down the anger of a minute,\nyou will for a whole life-time feel no remorse.”",
        "Whether Chin Jung complied or not to his advice is not known, but the\nfollowing chapter will explain.",
        "  Widow Chin, prompted by a desire to reap advantage, puts up\n      temporarily with an insult.\n  Dr. Chang in discussing Mrs. Chin’s illness minutely exhausts its\n      origin.",
        "We will now resume our story. As the persons against Chin Jung were so\nmany and their pressure so great, and as, what was more, Chia Jui urged\nhim to make amends, he had to knock his head on the ground before Ch’in\nChung. Pao-yü then gave up his clamorous remonstrances and the whole\ncrowd dispersed from school.",
        "Chin Jung himself returned home all alone, but the more he pondered on\nthe occurrence, the more incensed he felt. “Ch’in Chung,” he argued, “is\nsimply Chia Jung’s young brother-in-law, and is no son or grandson of\nthe Chia family, and he too joins the class and prosecutes his studies\non no other footing than that of mine; but it’s because he relies upon\nPao-yü’s friendship for him that he has no eye for any one. This being\nthe case, he should be somewhat proper in his behaviour, and there would\nbe then not a word to say about it! He has besides all along been very\nmystical with Pao-yü, imagining that we are all blind, and have no eyes\nto see what’s up! Here he goes again to-day and mixes with people in\nillicit intrigues; and it’s all because they happened to obtrude\nthemselves before my very eyes that this rumpus has broken out; but of\nwhat need I fear?”",
        "His mother, née Hu, hearing him mutter; “Why meddle again,” she\nexplained, “in things that don’t concern you? I had endless trouble in\ngetting to speak to your paternal aunt; and your aunt had, on the other\nhand, a thousand and one ways and means to devise, before she could\nappeal to lady Secunda, of the Western mansion; and then only it was\nthat you got this place to study in. Had we not others to depend upon\nfor your studies, would we have in our house the means sufficient to\nengage a teacher? Besides, in other people’s school, tea and eatables\nare all ready and found; and these two years that you’ve been there for\nyour lessons, we’ve likewise effected at home a great saving in what\nwould otherwise have been necessary for your eating and use. Something\nhas been, it’s true, economised; but you have further a liking for spick\nand span clothes. Besides, it’s only through your being there to study,\nthat you’ve come to know Mr. Hsüeh! that Mr. Hsüeh, who has even in one\nyear given us so much pecuniary assistance as seventy and eighty taels!\nAnd now you would go and raise a row in this school-room! why, if we\nwere bent upon finding such another place, I tell you plainly, and once\nfor all, that we would find it more difficult than if we tried to scale\nthe heavens! Now do quietly play for a while, and then go to sleep, and\nyou’ll be ever so much better for it then.”",
        "Chin Jung thereupon stifled his anger and held his tongue; and, after a\nshort while, he in fact went to sleep of his own accord.",
        "The next day he again went to school, and no further comment need be\nmade about it; but we will go on to explain that a young lady related to\nher had at one time been given in marriage to a descendant (of the\neldest branch) of the Chia family, (whose names were written) with the\njade radical, Chia Huang by name; but how could the whole number of\nmembers of the clan equal in affluence and power the two mansions of\nNing and Jung? This fact goes, as a matter of course, without saying.\nThe Chia Huang couple enjoyed some small income; but they also went, on\nfrequent occasions, to the mansions of Ning and Jung to pay their\nrespects; and they knew likewise so well how to adulate lady Feng and\nMrs. Yu, that lady Feng and Mrs. Yu would often grant them that\nassistance and support which afforded them the means of meeting their\ndaily expenses.",
        "It just occurred on this occasion that the weather was clear and fine,\nand that there happened, on the other hand, to be nothing to attend to\nat home, so forthwith taking along with her a matron, (Mrs. Chia Huang)\ngot into a carriage and came over to see widow Chin and her nephew.\nWhile engaged in a chat, Chin Jung’s mother accidentally broached the\nsubject of the affair, which had transpired in the school-room of the\nChia mansion on the previous day, and she gave, for the benefit of her\nyoung sister-in-law, a detailed account of the whole occurrence from\nbeginning to end.\n\r\nThis Mrs. Huang would not have had her temper ruffled had she not come\nto hear what had happened; but having heard about it, anger sprung from\nthe very depths of her heart. “This fellow, Ch’in Chung,” she exclaimed,\n\"is a relative of the Chia family, but is it likely that Jung Erh isn’t,\nin like manner, a relative of the Chia family; and when relatives are\nmany, there’s no need to put on airs! Besides, does his conduct consist,\nfor the most part, of anything that would make one get any face? In\nfact, Pao-yü himself shouldn’t do injury to himself by condescending to\nlook at him. But, as things have come to this pass, give me time and\nI’ll go to the Eastern mansion and see our lady Chen and then have a\nchat with Ch’in Chung’s sister, and ask her to decide who’s right and\nwho’s wrong!”",
        "Chin Jung’s mother upon hearing these words was terribly distressed.\n\"It’s all through my hasty tongue,” she observed with vehemence, “that\nI’ve told you all, sister-in-law: but please, sister, give up at once\nthe idea of going over to say anything about it! Don’t trouble yourself\nas to who is in the right, and who is in the wrong; for were any\nunpleasantness to come out of it, how could we here stand on our legs?\nand were we not to stand on our legs, not only would we never be able to\nengage a tutor, but the result will be, on the contrary, that for his\nown person will be superadded many an expense for eatables and\nnecessaries.”",
        "“What do I care about how many?” replied Mrs. Huang; “wait till I’ve\nspoken about it, and we’ll see what will be the result.” Nor would she\naccede to her sister-in-law’s entreaties, but bidding, at the same time,\nthe matron look after the carriage, she got into it, and came over to\nthe Ning Mansion.",
        "On her arrival at the Ning Mansion, she entered by the eastern side\ngate, and dismounting from the carriage, she went in to call on Mrs. Yu,\nthe spouse of Chia Chen, with whom she had not the courage to put on any\nhigh airs; but gently and quietly she made inquiries after her health,\nand after passing some irrelevant remarks, she ascertained: “How is it I\ndon’t see lady Jung to-day?”",
        "“I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Yu, “what’s the matter with her these last\nfew days; but she hasn’t been herself for two months and more; and the\ndoctor who was asked to see her declares that it is nothing connected\nwith any happy event. A couple of days back, she felt, as soon as the\nafternoon came, both to move, and both even to utter a word; while the\nbrightness of her eyes was all dimmed; and I told her, ’You needn’t\nstick to etiquette, for there’s no use for you to come in the forenoon\nand evening, as required by conventionalities; but what you must do is,\nto look after your own health. Should any relative come over, there’s\nalso myself to receive them; and should any of the senior generation\nthink your absence strange, I’ll explain things for you, if you’ll let\nme.’",
        "“I also advised brother Jung on the subject: ’You shouldn’t,’ I said,\n’allow any one to trouble her; nor let her be put out of temper, but let\nher quietly attend to her health, and she’ll get all right. Should she\nfancy anything to eat, just come over here and fetch it; for, in the\nevent of anything happening to her, were you to try and find another\nsuch a wife to wed, with such a face and such a disposition, why, I\nfear, were you even to seek with a lantern in hand, there would really\nbe no place where you could discover her. And with such a temperament\nand deportment as hers, which of our relatives and which of our elders\ndon’t love her?’ That’s why my heart has been very distressed these two\ndays! As luck would have it early this morning her brother turned up to\nsee her, but who would have fancied him to be such a child, and so\nignorant of what is proper and not proper to do? He saw well enough that\nhis sister was not well; and what’s more all these matters shouldn’t\nhave been recounted to her; for even supposing he had received the\ngravest offences imaginable, it behoved him anyhow not to have broached\r\nthe subject to her! Yesterday, one would scarcely believe it, a fight\noccurred in the school-room, and some pupil or other who attends that\nclass, somehow insulted him; besides, in this business, there were a\ngood many indecent and improper utterances, but all these he went and\ntold his sister! Now, sister-in-law, you are well aware that though (our\nson Jung’s) wife talks and laughs when she sees people, that she is\nnevertheless imaginative and withal too sensitive, so that no matter\nwhat she hears, she’s for the most part bound to brood over it for three\ndays and five nights, before she loses sight of it, and it’s from this\nexcessive sensitiveness that this complaint of hers arises. Today, when\nshe heard that some one had insulted her brother, she felt both vexed\nand angry; vexed that those fox-like, cur-like friends of his had moved\nright and wrong, and intrigued with this one and deluded that one; angry\nthat her brother had, by not learning anything profitable, and not\nhaving his mind set upon study, been the means of bringing about a row\nat school; and on account of this affair, she was so upset that she did\nnot even have her early meal. I went over a short while back and\nconsoled her for a time, and likewise gave her brother a few words of\nadvice; and after having packed off that brother of hers to the mansion\non the other side, in search of Pao-yü, and having stood by and seen her\nhave half a bowl of birds’ nests soup, I at length came over. Now,\nsister-in-law, tell me, is my heart sore or not? Besides, as there’s\nnowadays no good doctor, the mere thought of her complaint makes my\nheart feel as if it were actually pricked with needles! But do you and\nyours, perchance, know of any good practitioner?”",
        "Mrs. Chin had, while listening to these words, been, at an early period,\nso filled with concern that she cast away to distant lands the reckless\nrage she had been in recently while at her sister-in-law’s house, when\nshe had determined to go and discuss matters over with Mrs. Ch’in. Upon\nhearing Mrs. Yu inquire of her about a good doctor, she lost no time in\nsaying by way of reply: “Neither have we heard of any one speak of a\ngood doctor; but from the account I’ve just heard of Mrs. Ch’in’s\nillness, it may still, there’s no saying, be some felicitous ailment;\nso, sister-in-law, don’t let any one treat her recklessly, for were she\nto be treated for the wrong thing, the result may be dreadful!”",
        "“Quite so!” replied Mrs. Yu.",
        "But while they were talking, Chia Chen came in from out of doors, and\nupon catching sight of Mrs. Chin; “Isn’t this Mrs. Huang?” he inquired\nof Mrs. Yu; whereupon Mrs. Chin came forward and paid her respects to\nChia Chen.",
        "“Invite this lady to have her repast here before she goes,” observed\nChia Chen to Mrs. Yu; and as he uttered these words he forthwith walked\ninto the room on the off side.",
        "The object of Mrs. Chin’s present visit had originally been to talk to\nMrs. Ch’in about the insult which her brother had received from the\nhands of Ch’in Chung, but when she heard that Mrs. Ch’in was ill, she\ndid not have the courage to even so much as make mention of the object\nof her errand. Besides, as Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu had given her a most\ncordial reception, her resentment was transformed into pleasure, so that\nafter a while spent in a further chat about one thing and another, she\nat length returned to her home.",
        "It was only after the departure of Mrs. Chin that Chia Chen came over\nand took a seat. “What did she have to say for herself during this visit\nto-day?” he asked of Mrs. Yu.",
        "“She said nothing much,” replied Mrs. Yu. “When she first entered the\nroom, her face bore somewhat of an angry look, but, after a lengthy chat\nand as soon as mention of our son’s wife’s illness was made, this\nangered look after all gradually abated. You also asked me to keep her\nfor the repast, but, having heard that our son’s wife was so ill she\ncould not very well stay, so that all she did was to sit down, and after\nmaking a few more irrelevant remarks, she took her departure. But she\nhad no request to make. To return however now to the illness of Jung’s\nwife, it’s urgent that you should find somewhere a good doctor to\ndiagnose it for her; and whatever you do, you should lose no time. The\nwhole body of doctors who at present go in and out of our household, are\nthey worth having? Each one of them listens to what the patient has to\nsay of the ailment, and then, adding a string of flowery sentences, out\nhe comes with a long rigmarole; but they are exceedingly diligent in\npaying us visits; and in one day, three or four of them are here at\nleast four and five times in rotation! They come and feel her pulse,\nthey hold consultation together, and write their prescriptions, but,\nthough she has taken their medicines, she has seen no improvement; on\nthe contrary, she’s compelled to change her clothes three and five times\neach day, and to sit up to see the doctor; a thing which, in fact, does\nthe patient no good.”",
        "“This child too is somewhat simple,” observed Chia Chen; “for what need\nhas she to be taking off her clothes, and changing them for others? And\nwere she again to catch a chill, she would add something more to her\nillness; and won’t it be dreadful! The clothes may be no matter how\nfine, but what is their worth, after all? The health of our child is\nwhat is important to look to! and were she even to wear out a suit of\nnew clothes a-day, what would that too amount to? I was about to tell\nyou that a short while back, Feng Tzu-ying came to see me, and,\nperceiving that I had somewhat of a worried look, he asked me what was\nup; and I told him that our son’s wife was not well at all, that as we\ncouldn’t get any good doctor, we couldn’t determine with any certainty,\nwhether she was in an interesting condition, or whether she was\nsuffering from some disease; that as we could neither tell whether there\nwas any danger or not, my heart was, for this reason, really very much\ndistressed. Feng Tzu-ying then explained that he knew a young doctor who\nhad made a study of his profession, Chang by surname, and Yu-shih by\nname, whose learning was profound to a degree; who was besides most\nproficient in the principles of medicine, and had the knack of\ndiscriminating whether a patient would live or die; that this year he\nhad come to the capital to purchase an official rank for his son, and\nthat he was now living with him in his house. In view of these\ncircumstances, not knowing but that if, perchance, the case of our\ndaughter-in-law were placed in his hands, he couldn’t avert the danger,\nI readily despatched a servant, with a card of mine, to invite him to\ncome; but the hour to-day being rather late, he probably won’t be round,\nbut I believe he’s sure to be here to-morrow. Besides, Feng-Tzu-ying was\nalso on his return home, to personally entreat him on my behalf, so that\nhe’s bound, when he has asked him, to come and see her. Let’s therefore\nwait till Dr. Chang has been here and seen her, when we can talk matters\nover!”",
        "Mrs. Yu was very much cheered when she heard what was said. “The day\nafter to-morrow,” she felt obliged to add, “is again our senior’s, Mr.\nChia Ching’s birthday, and how are we to celebrate it after all?”",
        "“I’ve just been over to our Senior’s and paid my respects,” replied Chia\nChen, “and further invited the old gentleman to come home, and receive\nthe congratulations of the whole family.",
        "“’I’m accustomed,’ our Senior explained, ’to peace and quiet, and have\nno wish to go over to that worldly place of yours; for you people are\ncertain to have published that it’s my birthday, and to entertain the\ndesign to ask me to go round to receive the bows of the whole lot of\nyou. But won’t it be better if you were to give the “Record of\nMeritorious Acts,” which I annotated some time ago, to some one to copy\nout clean for me, and have it printed? Compared with asking me to come,\nand uselessly receive the obeisances of you all, this will be yea even a\nhundred times more profitable! In the event of the whole family wishing\nto pay me a visit on any of the two days, to-morrow or the day after\nto-morrow, if you were to stay at home and entertain them in proper\nstyle, that will be all that is wanted; nor will there be any need to\nsend me anything! Even you needn’t come two days from this; and should\nyou not feel contented at heart, well, you had better bow your head\nbefore me to-day before you go. But if you do come again the day after\nto-morrow, with a lot of people to disturb me, I shall certainly be\nangry with you.’ After what he said, I will not venture to go and see\nhim two days hence; but you had better send for Lai Sheng, and bid him\nget ready a banquet to continue for a couple of days.”",
        "Mrs. Yu, having asked Chia Jung to come round, told him to direct Lai\nSheng to make the usual necessary preparations for a banquet to last for\na couple of days, with due regard to a profuse and sumptuous style.",
        "“You go by-and-by,” (she advised him), “in person to the Western Mansion\nand invite dowager lady Chia, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and your\nsister-in-law Secunda lady Lien to come over for a stroll. Your father\nhas also heard of a good doctor, and having already sent some one to ask\nhim round, I think that by to-morrow he’s sure to come; and you had\nbetter tell him, in a minute manner, the serious symptoms of her ailment\nduring these few days.”",
        "Chia Jung having signified his obedience to each of her recommendations,\nand taken his leave, was just in time to meet the youth coming back from\nFeng Tzu-ying’s house, whither he had gone a short while back to invite\nthe doctor round.",
        "“Your slave,” he consequently reported, “has just been with a card of\nmaster’s to Mr. Feng’s house and asked the doctor to come. ’The gentleman\nhere,’ replied the doctor, ’has just told me about it; but to-day, I’ve\nhad to call on people the whole day, and I’ve only this moment come\nhome; and I feel now my strength (so worn out), that I couldn’t really\nstand any exertion. In fact were I even to get as far as the mansion, I\nshouldn’t be in a fit state to diagnose the pulses! I must therefore\nhave a night’s rest, but, to-morrow for certain, I shall come to the\nmansion. My medical knowledge,’ he went on to observe, ’is very shallow,\nand I don’t deserve the honour of such eminent recommendation; but as\nMr. Feng has already thus spoken of me in your mansion, I can’t but\npresent myself. It will be all right if in anticipation you deliver this\nmessage for me to your honourable master; but as for your worthy\nmaster’s card, I cannot really presume to keep it.’ It was again at his\ninstance that I’ve brought it back; but, Sir, please mention this result\nfor me (to master).”",
        "Chia Jung turned back again, and entering the house delivered the\nmessage to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; whereupon he walked out, and, calling\nLai Sheng before him, he transmitted to him the orders to prepare the\nbanquet for a couple of days.",
        "After Lai Sheng had listened to the directions, he went off, of course,\nto get ready the customary preparations; but upon these we shall not\ndilate, but confine ourselves to the next day.",
        "At noon, a servant on duty at the gate announced that the Doctor Chang,\nwho had been sent for, had come, and Chia Chen conducted him along the\nCourt into the large reception Hall, where they sat down; and after they\nhad partaken of tea, he broached the subject.",
        "“Yesterday,” he explained, “the estimable Mr. Feng did me the honour to\nspeak to me of your character and proficiency, venerable doctor, as well\nas of your thorough knowledge of medicine, and I, your mean brother, was\nfilled with an immeasurable sense of admiration!”",
        "“Your Junior,” remonstrated Dr. Chang, “is a coarse, despicable and mean\nscholar and my knowledge is shallow and vile! but as worthy Mr. Feng did\nme the honour yesterday of telling me that your family, sir, had\ncondescended to look upon me, a low scholar, and to favour me too with\nan invitation, could I presume not to obey your commands? But as I\ncannot boast of the least particle of real learning, I feel overburdened\nwith shame!”",
        "“Why need you be so modest?” observed Chia Chen; “Doctor, do please walk\nin at once to see our son’s wife, for I look up, with full reliance, to\nyour lofty intelligence to dispel my solicitude!”",
        "Chia Jung forthwith walked in with him. When they reached the inner\napartment, and he caught sight of Mrs. Ch’in, he turned round and asked\nChia Jung, “This is your honourable spouse, isn’t it?”",
        "“Yes, it is,” assented Chia Jung; “but please, Doctor, take a seat, and\nlet me tell you the symptoms of my humble wife’s ailment, before her\npulse be felt. Will this do?”",
        "“My mean idea is,” remarked the Doctor, “that it would, after all, be\nbetter that I should begin by feeling her pulse, before I ask you to\ninform me what the source of the ailment is. This is the first visit I\npay to your honourable mansion; besides, I possess no knowledge of\nanything; but as our worthy Mr. Feng would insist upon my coming over to\nsee you, I had in consequence no alternative but to come. After I have\nnow made a diagnosis, you can judge whether what I say is right or not,\nbefore you explain to me the phases of the complaint during the last few\ndays, and we can deliberate together upon some prescription; as to the\nsuitableness or unsuitableness of which your honourable father will then\nhave to decide, and what is necessary will have been done.”",
        "“Doctor,” rejoined Chia Jung, “you are indeed eminently clear sighted;\nall I regret at present is that we have met so late! But please, Doctor,\ndiagnose the state of the pulse, so as to find out whether there be hope\nof a cure or not; if a cure can be effected, it will be the means of\nallaying the solicitude of my father and mother.”",
        "The married women attached to that menage forthwith presented a pillow;\nand as it was being put down for Mrs. Ch’in to rest her arm on, they\nraised the lower part of her sleeve so as to leave her wrist exposed.\nThe Doctor thereupon put out his hand and pressed it on the pulse of the\nright hand. Regulating his breath (to the pulsation) so as to be able to\ncount the beatings, he with due care and minuteness felt the action for\na considerable time, when, substituting the left hand, he again went\nthrough the same operation.",
        "“Let us go and sit outside,” he suggested, after he had concluded\nfeeling her pulses. Chia Jung readily adjourned, in company with the\nDoctor, to the outer apartment, where they seated themselves on the\nstove-couch. A matron having served tea; “Please take a cup of tea,\ndoctor,” Chia Jung observed. When tea was over, “Judging,” he inquired,\n\"Doctor, from the present action of the pulses, is there any remedy or\nnot?”",
        "“The action of the pulse, under the forefinger, on the left hand of your\nhonorable spouse,” proceeded the Doctor, “is deep and agitated; the left\nhand pulse, under the second finger, is deep and faint. The pulse, under\nthe forefinger, of the right hand, is gentle and lacks vitality. The\nright hand pulse, under my second finger, is superficial, and has lost\nall energy. The deep and agitated beating of the forepulse of the left\nhand arises from the febrile state, due to the weak action of the heart.\nThe deep and delicate condition of the second part of the pulse of the\nleft wrist, emanates from the sluggishness of the liver, and the\nscarcity of the blood in that organ. The action of the forefinger pulse,\nof the right wrist, is faint and lacks strength, as the breathing of the\nlungs is too weak. The second finger pulse of the right wrist is\nsuperficial and devoid of vigour, as the spleen must be affected\ninjuriously by the liver. The weak action of the heart, and its febrile\nstate, should be the natural causes which conduce to the present\nirregularity in the catamenia, and insomnia at night; the poverty of\nblood in the liver, and the sluggish condition of that organ must\nnecessarily produce pain in the ribs; while the overdue of the\ncatamenia, the cardiac fever, and debility of the respiration of the\nlungs, should occasion frequent giddiness in the head, and swimming of\nthe eyes, the certain recurrence of perspiration between the periods of\n3 to 5 and 5 to 7, and the sensation of being seated on board ship. The\nobstruction of the spleen by the liver should naturally create distaste\nfor liquid or food, debility of the vital energies and prostration of\nthe four limbs. From my diagnosis of these pulses, there should exist\nthese various symptoms, before (the pulses and the symptoms can be said)\nto harmonise. But should perchance (any doctor maintain) that this state\nof the pulses imports a felicitous event, your servant will not presume\nto give an ear to such an opinion!”",
        "A matron, who was attached as a personal attendant (to Mrs. Ch’in,) and\nwho happened to be standing by interposed: “How could it be otherwise?\"\nshe ventured. “In real truth, Doctor, you speak like a supernatural\nbeing, and there’s verily no need for us to say anything! We have now,\nready at hand, in our household, a good number of medical gentlemen, who\nare in attendance upon her, but none of these are proficient enough to\nspeak in this positive manner. Some there are who say that it’s a\ngenital complaint; others maintain that it’s an organic disease. This\ndoctor explains that there is no danger: while another, again, holds\nthat there’s fear of a crisis either before or after the winter\nsolstice; but there is, in one word, nothing certain said by them. May\nit please you, sir, now to favour us with your clear directions.”",
        "“This complaint of your lady’s,” observed the Doctor, “has certainly\nbeen neglected by the whole number of doctors; for had a treatment with\ncertain medicines been initiated at the time of the first occurrence of\nher habitual sickness, I cannot but opine that, by this time, a perfect\ncure would have been effected. But seeing that the organic complaint has\nnow been, through neglect, allowed to reach this phase, this calamity\nwas, in truth, inevitable. My ideas are that this illness stands, as\nyet, a certain chance of recovery, (three chances out of ten); but we\nwill see how she gets on, after she has had these medicines of mine.\nShould they prove productive of sleep at night, then there will be added\nfurthermore two more chances in the grip of our hands. From my\ndiagnosis, your lady is a person, gifted with a preëminently excellent,\nand intelligent disposition; but an excessive degree of intelligence is\nthe cause of frequent contrarieties; and frequent contrarieties give\norigin to an excessive amount of anxious cares. This illness arises from\nthe injury done, by worrying and fretting, to the spleen, and from the\ninordinate vigour of the liver; hence it is that the relief cannot come\nat the proper time and season. Has not your lady, may I ask, heretofore\nat the period of the catamenia, suffered, if indeed not from anaemia,\nthen necessarily from plethora? Am I right in assuming this or not?”",
        "“To be sure she did,” replied the matron; “but she has never been\nsubject to anaemia, but to a plethora, varying from either two to three\ndays, and extending, with much irregularity, to even ten days.”",
        "“Quite so!” observed the Doctor, after hearing what she had to say, “and\nthis is the source of this organic illness! Had it in past days been\ntreated with such medicine as could strengthen the heart, and improve\nthe respiration, would it have reached this stage? This has now overtly\nmade itself manifest in an ailment originating from the paucity of water\nand the vigour of fire; but let me make use of some medicines, and we’ll\nsee how she gets on!”",
        "There and then he set to work and wrote a prescription, which he handed\nto Chia Jung, the purpose of which was: Decoction for the improvement of\nrespiration, the betterment of the blood, and the restoration of the\nspleen. Ginseng, Atractylodes Lancea; Yunnan root; Prepared Ti root;\nAralia edulis; Peony roots; Levisticum from Sze Ch’uan; Sophora\ntormentosa; Cyperus rotundus, prepared with rice; Gentian, soaked in\nvinegar; Huai Shan Yao root; Real “O” glue; Carydalis Ambigua; and Dried\nliquorice. Seven Fukien lotus seeds, (the cores of which should be\nextracted,) and two large zizyphi to be used as a preparative.",
        "“What exalted intelligence!” Chia Jung, after perusing it, exclaimed.\n\"But I would also ask you, Doctor, to be good enough to tell me whether\nthis illness will, in the long run, endanger her life or not?”",
        "The Doctor smiled. “You, sir, who are endowed with most eminent\nintelligence (are certain to know) that when a human illness has reached\nthis phase, it is not a derangement of a day or of a single night; but\nafter these medicines have been taken, we shall also have to watch the\neffect of the treatment! My humble opinion is that, as far as the winter\nof this year goes, there is no fear; in fact, after the spring equinox,\nI entertain hopes of a complete cure.”",
        "Chia Jung was likewise a person with all his wits about him, so that he\ndid not press any further minute questions.",
        "Chia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking the\nprescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for his\nperusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all that\nhad been said on the subject.",
        "“The other doctors have hitherto not expressed any opinions as positive\nas this one has done,” observed Mrs. Yu, addressing herself to Chia\nChen, “so that the medicines to be used are, I think, surely the right\nones!”",
        "“He really isn’t a man,” rejoined Chia Chen, “accustomed to give much of\nhis time to the practice of medicine, in order to earn rice for his\nsupport: and it’s Feng Tzu-ying, who is so friendly with us, who is\nmainly to be thanked for succeeding, after ever so much trouble, in\ninducing him to come. But now that we have this man, the illness of our\nson’s wife may, there is no saying, stand a chance of being cured. But\non that prescription of his there is ginseng mentioned, so you had\nbetter make use of that catty of good quality which was bought the other\nday.”",
        "Chia Jung listened until the conversation came to a close, after which\nhe left the room, and bade a servant go and buy the medicines, in order\nthat they should be prepared and administered to Mrs. Ch’in.",
        "What was the state of Mrs. Ch’in’s illness, after she partook of these\nmedicines, we do not know; but, reader, listen to the explanation given\nin the chapter which follows.",
