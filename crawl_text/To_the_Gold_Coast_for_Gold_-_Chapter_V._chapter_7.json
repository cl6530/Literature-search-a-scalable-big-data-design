        "TO TENERIFE, LA LAGUNA, AND OROTAVA.",
        "When I left, in 1865, the western coast of the Dark Continent, its\ntransit and traffic were monopolised by the A(frican) S(team) S(hip)\nCompany, a monthly line established in 1852, mainly by the late\nMacgregor Laird. In 1869 Messieurs Elder, Dempster, and Co., of Glasgow,\nstarted the B(ritish) and A(frican) to divide the spoils. The junior\nnumbers nineteen keel, including two being built. It could easily ’eat\nup’ the decrepit senior, which is now known as the A(frican)\nS(tarvation) S(teamers); but this process would produce serious\ncompetition. Both lines sail from Liverpool on alternate Saturdays, and\nmake Funchal, with their normal unpunctuality, between Fridays and\nSundays. This is dreary slow compared with the four days’ fast running\nof the ’Union S. S. C.’ and the comfortable ’Castle Line,’ alias the\nCape steamers.",
        "The B. and A. s.s. Senegal is a fair specimen of the modern West\nAfrican trader ’improved:’ unfortunately the improvements affect the\nshareholders’ pockets rather than the passengers’ persons. The\nsleeping-berths are better, but the roomy, well-lighted, comfortable old\nsaloon, sadly shorn of its fair proportions, has become the upper story\nof a store-room. The unfortunate stewards must catch fever by frequent\ndiving into the close and sultry mine of solids and fluids under\nfloor. There being no baggage-compartment, boxes and bags are stowed\naway in the after part, unduly curtailing light and air; the stern\nlockers, once such pleasant sleeping-sofas, and their fixed tables are\nof no use to anything besides baskets and barrels. Here the surgeon,\nwho, if anyone, should have a cabin by way of dispensary, must lodge his\nmedicine-chest. Amongst minor grievances the main cabin is washed every\nnight, breeding a manner of malaria. The ice intended for passengers is\neither sold or preserved for those who ship most cargo. Per contra, the\ncook is good, the table is plentiful, the wines not over bad, the\nstewards civil, and the officers companionable.",
        "Both lines, however, are distinctly traders. They bind themselves to no\ntime; they are often a week late, and they touch wherever demand calls\nthem. The freight-charges are exorbitant, three pounds for fine goods\nand a minimum of thirty-six shillings, when fifteen per ton would\npay. The White Star Line, therefore, threatens concurrence. Let\nus also hope that when the Gold Mines prosper we shall have our special\nsteamers, where the passenger will be more prized than the puncheon of\npalm-oil. But future rivals must have a care; they will encounter a\nsomewhat unscrupulous opposition; and they had better ship American\ncrews, at any rate not Liverpudlians.",
        "The night and the next day were spent at sea in a truly delicious\nclimate, which seemed to wax softer and serener as we advanced. Here the\nmoon, whose hue is golden, not silvern, has a regular dawn before\nrising, and an afterglow to her setting; and Venus casts a broad cestus\nof glimmering light upon the purple sea. Mount Atlas, alias the Pike of\nTeyde, gradually upreared his giant statue, two and a half miles high:\ntravellers speak of seeing him from Madeira, a distance of some 260\n(dir. geog.) miles; but this would be possible only were both termini\n15,000 feet in altitude. The limit of sight for terrestrial objects\nunder the most favourable conditions does not exceed 210 miles. Yet here\nit is not difficult to explain the impossible distances, 200 miles\ninstead of 120, at which, they say, the cone has been sighted: mirage or\nrefraction accounts for what the earth’s convexity disallows.",
        "We first see a low and regular wall of cloud-bank whose coping bears\nhere and there bulges of white, cottony cloud. Then a regular pyramid,\nat this season white as snow, shows its gnomon-like point, impaling the\ncumuli. Hour by hour the outlines grow clearer, till at last the\nterminal cone looks somewhat like a thimble upon a pillow–the\ncumbre, or lofty foundation of pumice-plains. But the aspect\neverywhere varies according as you approach the island from north,\nsouth, east, or west.",
        "The evening of January 9 showed us right abeam a splendid display of the\nZodiacal Light, whose pyramid suggested the glow of a hemisphere on\nfire. The triangle, slightly spherical, measured at its base 22 degrees\nto 24 degrees and rose to within 6” of Jupiter. The reflection in the\nwater was perfect and lit up with startling distinctness the whole\neastern horizon.",
        "At 7 A.M. next morning, after running past the Anaga knuckle-bone–and\nvery bony it is–of the Tenerife gigot, we cast anchor in the Bay\nof Santa Cruz, took boat, and hurried ashore. In the early times of the\nA.S.S. halts at the several stations often lasted three days. Business\nis now done in the same number of hours; and the captain informs you\nthat ’up goes the anchor’ the moment his last bale or bag comes on\nboard. This trading economy of time, again, is an improvement more\nsatisfactory to the passenger than to the traveller and sightseer who\nmay wish to see the world.",
        "Brusque was the contrast between the vivid verdure of Sylvania, the Isle\nof Wood, and the grim nudity of north-eastern Tenerife; brusquer still\nthe stationary condition of the former compared with the signs, of\nprogress everywhere evident in the latter. Spain, under the influence of\nanticlerical laws and a spell of republicanism, has awoke from her sleep\nof ages, and we note the effects of her revival even in these\ncolonies. A brand-new red fort has been added to La Ciudadela at the\nnorthern suburb, whence a mole is proposed to meet the southern branch\nand form a basin. Then comes the triangular city whose hypothenuse,\nfronting east, is on the sea; its chief fault is having been laid out on\ntoo small a scale. At the still-building pier, which projects some 500\nyards from the central mass of fort and cuadras (insulae or\nhouse-blocks), I noticed a considerable growth of buildings, especially\nthe Marineria and other offices connected with the free port. The old\npink ’castle’ San Cristobal (Christopher), still cumbers the jetty-root;\nbut the least sentimental can hardly expect the lieges to level so\nhistoric a building: it is the site of Alonso Fernandez de Lugo’s first\ntower, and where his disembarkation on May 3, 1493, gave its Christian\nname ’Holy Cross’ to the Guanche ’Añasa.’ Meanwhile the Rambleta de\nRavenal, dated 1861, a garden, formerly dusty, glary, and dreary as the\nold Florian of Malta, now bears lovers’ seats, a goodly growth of planes\nand tamarinds, a statue, a fountain, and generally a gypsy-like\nfamily. By its side runs a tramway for transporting the huge blocks of\nconcrete intended to prolong the pier. The inner town also shows a new\npalace, a new hospital, and a host of improvements.",
        "Landing at Santa Cruz, a long dull line of glaring masonry, smokeless\nand shadeless, was to me intensely saddening. A score of years had\ncarried off all my friends. Kindly Mrs. Nugent, called ’the Admiral,’\nand her amiable daughter are in the English burial-ground; the\nhospitable Mr. Consul Grattan had also faded from the land of the\nliving. The French Consul, M. Berthelot, who published [Footnote:\nHistoire naturelle des Iles Canaries, par MM. P. Barker Webb et\nSabin Berthelot, ouvrage publié sous les auspices de M. Guizot, Ministre\nde l’Instruction Publique, Paris, 1839. Seven folio vols., with maps,\nplans, and sketches, all regardless of expense.] by favour of the late\nMr. Webb, went to the many in 1880. One of the brothers Richardson had\ndied; the other had subsided into a clerk, and the Fonda Ingleza had\nbecome the British Consulate. The new hotel kept by Señor Camacho and\nhis English wife appeared comfortable enough, but it had none of those\nassociations which make the old familiar inn a kind of home. En\nrevanche, however, I met Mr. Consul Dundas, my successor at the port\nof Santos, whence so few have escaped with life; and his wife, the\ndaughter of an Anglo-Brazilian friend.",
        "Between 1860 and 1865 I spent many a week in Tenerife, and here I am\ntempted to transcribe a few extracts from my voluminous notes upon\nvarious subjects, especially the Guanche population and the ascent of\nthe Pike. A brief history of the unhappy Berber-speaking goatherds who,\nafter being butchered to make sport for certain unoccupied gentlemen,\nhave been raised by their assailants to kings and heroes rivalling the\ndemi-gods of Greece and Rome, and the melancholy destruction of the\nrace, have been noticed in a previous volume. [Footnote: Yol. i. chap,\nii., Wanderings in West Africa. The modorra, lethargy or\nmelancholia, which killed so many of those Numidian islanders suggests\nthe pining of a wild bird prisoned in a cage.] I here confine myself to\nthe contents of my note-book upon the Guanche collections in the island.",
        "One fine morning my wife and I set out in a venerable carriage for San\nCristobal de la Laguna. The Camiño de los Coches, a fine modern highway\nin corkscrew fashion from Santa Cruz to Orotava, was begun, by the grace\nof General Ortega, who died smoking in the face of the firing party, and\nended between 1862 and 1868. This section, eight kilomètres long,\noccupies at least one hour and a half, zigzagging some 2,000 feet up a\nsteep slope which its predecessor uncompromisingly breasted. Here stood\nthe villa of Peter Pindar (Dr. Walcott), who hymned the fleas of\nTenerife: I would back those of Tiberias. The land is arid, being\nexposed to the full force of the torrid northeast trade. Its principal\nproduce is the cactus (coccinellifera), a fantastic monster with\nfat oval leaves and apparently destitute of aught beyond thorns and\nprickles. Here and there a string of small and rather mangy camels, each\ncarrying some 500 lbs., paced par monts et par vaux, and gave a\nBedawi touch to the scene: they were introduced from Africa by De\nBéthencourt, surnamed the Great. We remarked the barrenness of the\nbronze-coloured Banda del Sur, whose wealth is in cochineal and\n’dripstones,’ or filters of porous lava. Here few save the hardiest\nplants can live, the spiny, gummy, and succulent cactus and thistles,\naloes and figs. The arborescent tabayba (Euphorbia canariensis),\nlocally called ’cardon,’ is compared by some with the ’chandelier’ of\nthe Cape, bristling with wax tapers: the Guanches used it extensively\nfor narcotising fish. This ’milk plant,’ with its acrid, viscid, and\nvirulent juice, and a small remedial shrub growing by its side, probably\ngave rise to the island fable of the twin fountains; one killed the\ntraveller by a kind of risus Sardonicus, unless he used the other\nby way of cure. A scatter of crosses, which are impaled against every\nwall and which rise from every eminence; a ruined fort here and there; a\nlong zigzag for wheels, not over-macadamised, with an older short cut\nfor hoofs, and the Puente de Zurita over the Barranco Santo, an old\nbridge made new, led to the cuesta, or crest, which looks down\nupon the Vega de la Laguna, the native Aguere.",
        "The ’noble and ancient city’ San Cristobal de la Laguna was founded on\nJune 26, 1495, St. Christopher’s Day, by De Lugo, who lies buried in the\nSan Miguel side-chapel of La Concepcion de la Victorias. The site is an\nancient lava-current, the successor of a far older crater, originally\nsubmarine. The latest sub-aerial fire-stream, a broad band flowing from\nnorth to south–we have ascended it by the coach-road–and garnished\nwith small parasitic craters, affords a bed and basis to the\ncapital-port, Santa Cruz. After rains the lake reappears in mud and\nmire; and upon the lip where the town is built the north-east and the\nsouth-west winds contend for mastery, shedding abundant tears. Yet the\nold French chronicler says of the site, ’Je ne croy pas qu’il y eu ait\nen tout le monde aucune autre de plus plaisante.’ The mean annual\ntemperature is 62° 51’ (F.), and the sensation is of cold: the altitude\nbeing 1,740 feet. Hence, like Orotava, it escaped the yellow fever which\nin October 1862 had slain its 616 victims.",
        "[Footnote: The list of epidemics at Santa Cruz is rather formidable,\ne.g. 1621 and 1628, peste (plague); 1810 and 1862, yellow\nJack; 1814, whooping cough, scarlatina, and measles; 1816-16, small-pox\n(2,000 victims); 1826, cough and scarlet ferer; 1847, fatal dysentery;\nand 1861-62, cholera (7,000 to 12,000 deaths).]",
        "La Laguna offers an extensive study of medieval baronial houses, of\ncolonial churches, of ermitas, or chapels, of altars, and of\nconvents now deserted, but once swarming with Franciscans and Augustines\nand Dominicans and Jesuits. These establishments must have been very\nrich, for, here as elsewhere,",
        "  Dieu prodigue ses biens\n  À ceux qui font voeu d’être siens.",
        "St. Augustine, with its short black belfry, shows a Christus Vinctus of\nthe Seville school, and the institute or college in the ex-monastery\ncontains a library of valuable old books. The Concepcion boasts a\npicture of St. John which in 1648 sweated for forty days. [Footnote:\nEvidently a survival of the classic aera sudantia. Mrs. Murray\nnotices the ’miracle’ at full length (ii. 76).] The black and white\ncathedral, bristling with cannon-like gargoyles, a common architectural\nfeature in these regions, still owns the fine pulpit of Carrara marble\nsent from Genoa in 1767. The chef d’oeuvre then cost 200l.;\nnow it would be cheap at five times that price. In the sacristy\nare the usual rich vestments and other clerical curios. The\nErmita de San Cristobal, built upon an historic site, is denoted as\nusual by a giant Charon bearing a small infant. There is a Carriera or\nCorso (High Street) mostly empty, also the great deserted Plaza del\nAdelantado, of the conqueror Lugo. The arms of the latter, with his\nlance and banner, are shown at the Ayuntamiento, or town-house; I do not\nadmire his commercial motto–",
        "Conquering must not be named in the same breath as ’bread-winning.’\nThere, too, is the scutheon of Tenerife, given to it in 1510; Michael\nthe Archangel, a favourite with the invader, stands unroasted upon the\nfire-vomiting Nivarian peak, and this grand vision of the guarded mount\ngave rise to satiric lines by Vieira:–",
        "The deserted streets were long lines with an unclean central\ngutter. Some of the stone houses were tall, grand, solid, and stately;\nsuch are the pavilion of the Counts of Salazar, the huge, heavy abode of\nthe Marquesses de Nava, and the mansions of the Villanuevas del\nPardo. But yellow fever had driven away half of the population–10,000\nsouls, who could easily be 20,000–and had barricaded the houses to the\ncurious stranger. Most of them, faced and porticoed with florid pillars,\nwere mere dickies opening upon nothing, and only the huge armorial\nbearings showed that they had ever been owned. Mixed with these\n’palaces.’ were ’cat-faced cottages’ and pauper, mildewed tenements,\nwhose rusty iron-work, tattered planks, and broken windows gave them a\ntruly dreary and dismal appearance. The sole noticeable movement was a\ntendency to gravitate in the roofs. The principal growth, favoured by\nthe vapour-laden air, was of grass in the thoroughfares, of moss on the\nwalls, and of the ’fat weed’ upon the tiles. The horse-leek\n(sempervivum urbium), brought from Madeira, was first described\nby the ’gifted Swede’ Professor Smith, who died on the Congo\nRiver. Finally, though the streets are wide and regular, and the large\ntown is well aired by four squares, the whole aspect was strongly\nsuggestive of the cocineros (cooks), as the citizens of the\ncapital are called by the sons of the capital-port. They retort by\nterming their rival brethren chicharreros, or fishers of the\nchicharro (horse-mackerel, Caranx Cuvieri.)",
        "From La Laguna we passed forward to Tacoronte, the ’Garden of the\nGuanches,’ and inspected the little museum of the late D. Sebastian\nCasilda, collected by his father, a merchant-captain de long\ncours. It was a chaos of curiosities ranging from China to\nPeru. Amongst them, however, were four entire mummies, including one\nfrom Grand Canary. Thus we can correct M. Berthelot, who follows others\nin asserting that only the Guanches of Tenerife mummified their\ndead. The oldest description of this embalming is by a ’judicious and\ningenious man who had lived twenty years in the island as a physitian\nand merchant.’ It was inserted by Dr. Thomas Sprat in the ’Transactions\nof the Royal Society,’ London, and was republished in John Ogilby’s\nenormous folio [Footnote: The ’physitian’ was Dr. Eden, an Englishman\nwho visited Tenerife in 1662.–Bohn’s Humboldtr, i. 66] yclept\n’Africa.’ The merchant ’set out from Guimar, a Town for the most part\ninhabited by such as derive themselves from the Antient\nGuanchios, in the company of some of them, to view their Caves\nand the corps buried in them (a favour they seldom or never permit to\nany, having the Corps of their Ancestors in great veneration, and\nlikewise being extremely against any molestation of the Dead); but he\nhad done many Eleemosynary Cures amongst them, for they are very poor\n(yet the poorest think themselves too good to Marry with the best\nSpaniard), which endeared him to them exceedingly. Otherwise it\nis death for any Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies. The Corps are\nsew’d up in Goatskins with Thongs of the same, with very great\ncuriosity, particularly in the incomparable exactness and evenness of\nthe Seams; and the skins are made close and fit to the Corps, which for\nthe most part are entire, the Eyes clos’d, Hair on their heads, Ears,\nNose, Teeth, Lips, and Beards, all perfect, onely discolour’d and a\nlittle shrivell’d. He saw about three or four hundred in several Caves,\nsome of them standing, others lying upon Beds of Wood, so hardened by an\nart they had (which the Spaniards call curay, to cure a piece of\nWood) that no iron can pierce or hurt it.[Footnote: The same writer\ntells that they had earthen pots so hard that they could not be\nbroken. I have heard of similar articles amongst the barbarous races\neast of Dalmatia.] These Bodies are very light, as if made of straw; and\nin some broken Bodies he observ’d the Nerves and Tendons, and also the\nString of the Veins and Arteries very distinctly. By the relation of one\nof the most antient of this island, they had a particular Tribe that had\nthis art onely among themselves, and kept it as a thing sacred and not\nto be communicated to the Vulgar. These mixt not themselves with the\nrest of the Inhabitants, nor marry’d out of their own Tribe, and were\nalso their Priests and Ministers of Religion. But when the\nSpaniards conquer’d the place, most of them were destroy’d and\nthe art perisht with them, onely they held some Traditions yet of a few\nIngredients that were us’d in this business; they took Butter (some say\nthey mixed Bear’s-grease with it) which they kept for that purpose in\nthe Skins; wherein they boyl’d certain Herbs, first a kind of wild\nLavender, which grows there in great quantities upon the Rocks;\nsecondly, an Herb call’d Lara, of a very gummy and glutinous\nconsistence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains;\nthirdly, a kind of cyclamen, or sow-bread; fourthly, wild Sage,\nwhich grows plentifully upon this island. These with others, bruised and\nboyl’d up into Butter, rendered it a perfect Balsom. This prepar’d, they\nfirst unbowel the Corps (and in the poorer sort, to save Charges, took\nout the Brain behind): after the Body was thus order’d, they had in\nreadiness a lixivium made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, wherewith\nthey washt the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer and in the Winter in\na Stove, repeating this very often: Afterward they began their unction\nboth without and within, drying it as before; this they continu’d till\nthe Balsom had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muscle in all\nparts appear’d through the contracted Skin, and the Body became\nexceeding light: then they sew’d them up in Goat-skins. The Antients\nsay, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great\nPersonages with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themselves,\nand which they will never discover.’ Lastly, the ’physitian’ declares\nthat ’bodies are found in the caves of the Grand Canaries, in\nSacks, quite consumed, and not as these in Teneriff.’",
        "This assertion is somewhat doubtful; apparently the practice was common\nto the archipelago. It at once suggests Egypt; and, possibly, at one\ntime, extended clean across the Dark Continent. So Dr. Barth [Footnote:\nTravels, &c., vol. iv. pp. 426-7.] tells us that when the chief\nSonni Ali died in Grurma, ’his sons, who accompanied him on the\nexpedition, took out his entrails and filled his inside with honey, in\norder that it might be preserved from putrefaction.’  Many tribes in\nSouth America and New Zealand, as well as in Africa, preserved the\ncorpse or portions of it by baking, and similar rude devices. According\nto some authorities, the Gruanche menceys (kinglets or chiefs)\nwere boxed, Egyptian fashion, in coffins; but few are found, because the\nsuperstitious Christian islanders destroy the contents of every\ncatacomb.",
        "In the Casilda collection I observed the hard features, broad brows,\nsquare faces, and flavos crines described by old writers. Two\nshowed traces of tongue and eyes (which often were blue), proving that\nthe softer and more perishable parts were not removed. There were\nspecimens of the dry and liquid balsam. Of the twenty-six skulls six\nwere from Grand Canary. All were markedly of the type called Caucasian,\nand some belonged to exceptionally tall men. The shape was\ndolichocephalic, with sides rather flat than rounded; the perceptive\nregion was well developed, and the reflective, as usual amongst savages\nand barbarians, was comparatively poor. The facial region appeared\nunusually large.",
        "The industrial implements were coarse needles and fish-hooks of\nsheep-bone. The domestic supellex consisted of wooden ladles\ncoarsely cut, and of rude pottery, red and yellow, generally without\nhandles, round-shaped and adorned with scratches. None of these\nganigos, or crocks, were painted like those of Grand Canary. They\nused also small basaltic querns of two pieces to grind the gofio,\n[Footnote: The gofio was composed of ripe barley, toasted,\npounded, and kneaded to a kind of porridge in leathern bags like Turkish\ntobacco-pouches. The object was to save the teeth, of which the Guanches\nwere particularly careful.] or parched grain. The articles of dress were\ngrass-cloth, thick as matting, and tamarcos, or smock-frocks, of\npoorly tanned goatskins. They had also rough cords of palm-fibre, and\nthey seem to have preferred plaiting to weaving; yet New Zealand flax\nand aloes grow abundantly. Their mahones correspond with Indian\nmoccasins, and they made sugar-loaf caps of skins. The bases of shells,\nground down to the thickness of a crown-piece, and showing spiral\ndepressions, were probably the viongwa, necklaces still worn in\nthe Lake Regions of Central Africa. The beads were of many kinds; some\nhorn cylinders bulging in the centre, and measuring 1.25 inch long;\nothers of flattened clay like the American wampum or the ornaments of\nthe Fernando Po tribes; and others flattened discs, also baked, almost\nidentical with those found upon African mummies–in Peru they were used\nto record dates and events. A few were of reddish agate, a material not\nfound in the island; these resembled bits of thick pipe-stem, varying\nfrom half an inch to an inch in length. Perhaps they were copies of the\nmysterious Popo-bead found upon the Slave Coast and in inner Africa.",
        "The Gruanches were doomed never to reach the age of metal. Their\ncivilisation corresponded with that of the Chinese in the days of\nFo-hi. [Footnote: Abel Rémusat tells us that of the two hundred\nprimitive Chinese ’hieroglyphs’ none showed a knowledge of metal.] The\nchief weapons were small triangles of close-grained basalt and\niztli (obsidian flakes) for tabonas, or knives, both being\nwithout handles. They carried rude clubs and banot, or barbed\nspears of pine-wood with fire-charred points. The garrotes\n(pikes) had heads like two flattened semicircles, a shape preserved\namongst negroes to the present day. Our old author tells us that the\npeople would ’leap from rock to rock, sometimes making ten Fathoms deep\nat one Leap, in this manner: First they tertiate their Lances,\nwhich are about the bigness of a Half-Pike, and aim with the Point at\nany piece of a Rock upon which they intend to light, sometimes not half\na Foot broad; in leaping off they clap their Feet close to the Lance,\nand so carry their bodies in the Air: the Point of the Lance comes first\nto the place, which breaks the force of their fall; then they slide\ngently down by the Staff and pitch with their Feet on the very place\nthey first design’d; and so from Rock to Rock till they come to the\nbottom: but their Novices sometimes break their necks in the learning.’",
        "I observed more civilisation in articles from the other islands,\nespecially from the eastern, nearer the African continent. In 1834\nFuerteventura yielded, from a depth of six feet, a dwarfish image of a\nwoman with prominent bosom and dressed in the native way: it appeared\nalmost Chinese. A pot of black clay from Palmas showed superior\nconstruction. Here, too, in 1762 a cavern produced a basalt plate, upon\nwhich are circular scrawls, which support the assertions of old writers\nas regards the islanders not being wholly ignorant of letters. I could\ntrace no similarity to the peculiar Berber characters, and held them to\nbe mere ornamentation. The so-called ’Seals of the Kings’ were dark\nstones, probably used for painting the skin; they bore parallelograms\nenclosed within one another, diaper-work and gridirons of raised\nlines. In fact, the Guanches of Tenerife were unalphabetic.",
        "Hierro (Ferro), the Barranco de los Balos (Grand Canary), Fuerteventura,\nand other items of the Fortunates have produced some undoubted\ninscriptions. They are compared by M. Berthelot with the signs engraved\nupon the cave-entrance of La Piedra Escrita in the Sierra Morena of\nAndalusia; with those printed by General Faidherbe in his work on the\nNumidic or Lybian epigraphs; with the ’Thugga inscription,’ Tunis; and\nwith the rock-gravings of the Sahará, attributed to the ancient Tawárik\nor Tifinegs. Dr. Gran-Bassas (El Museo Canario), who finds a notable\nlikeness between them and the ’Egyptian characters (cursive or demotic),\nPhenician and Hebrew,’ notes that they are engraved in vertical series.\nDr. Verneau, of the Academy, Paris, suggests that some of these epigraphs\nare alphabetic, while others are hieroglyphic. [Footnote: El Museo\nCanario, No. 40, Oct. 22, 1881.] Colonel H. W. Keays-Young kindly copied\nfor me, with great care, a painting in the Tacoronte museum. It\nrepresents a couple of Guanche inscriptions, apparently hieroglyphic,\nfound (1762) in the cave of Belmaco, Isle of Palma, by the ancients called\nBenahoave. They are inscribed upon two basaltic stones.",
        "[Illustration: THE NOMIDIO INSCRIPTIONS OF HIEBRO.]",
        "[Illustration]",
        "I also inspected the collection of a well-known lawyer, Dr. Francisco\nMaria de Leon. Of the three Guanche skulls one was of African solidity,\nwith the sutures almost obliterated: it was the model of a soldier’s\nhead, thick and heavy. The mass of mummy-balsam had been tested, without\nother result than finding a large proportion of dragon’s blood. In the\nfourteenth century Grand Canary sent to Europe at one venture two\nhundred doubloons’ worth of this drug.",
        "By the kindness of the Governor I was permitted to inspect four Guanche\nmummies, discovered (June 1862) in the jurisdiction of Candelaria.\nAwaiting exportation to Spain, they had been temporarily\ncoffined upon a damp ground-floor, where the cockroaches respected\nnothing, not even a Guanehe. I was accompanied by Dr. Angel\nM. Yzquierdo, of Cadiz, physician to the hospital, and we jotted down as\nfollows:–",
        "No. 1, a male of moderate size, wanted the head and upper limbs, while\nthe trunk was reduced to a skeleton. The characteristic signs were\nCaucasian and not negro; nor was there any appearance of the Jewish\nrite. The lower right leg, foot, and toe-nails were well preserved; the\nleft was a mere bone, wanting tarsus and metatarsus. The stomach was\nfull of dried fragments of herbs (Ohenopodium, &c.), and the\nepidermis was easily reduced to powder. In this case, as in the other\nthree, the mortuary skins were coarsely sewn with the hair inside: it is\na mistake to say that the work was ’like that of a glove.’",
        "No. 2 was large-statured and complete; the framework and the form of the\npelvis were masculine. The skin adhered to the cranium except behind,\nwhere the bone protruded, probably the effect of long resting upon the\nground. Near the right temporal was another break in the skin, which\nhere appeared much decayed. All the teeth were present, but they were\nnot particularly white nor good. The left forearm and hand were wanting,\nand the right was imperfect; the lower limbs were well preserved even to\nthe toe-nails.",
        "No. 3, also of large size, resembled No. 2; the upper limbs were\ncomplete, and the lower wanted only the toes of the left foot. The lower\njaw was absent, and the upper had no teeth. An oval depression, about an\ninch in its greater diameter, lay above the right orbit. If this be a\nbullet-mark, the mummy may date from before the final conquest and\nsubmission in A.D. 1496. But it may also have resulted from some\naccident, like a fall, or from the blow of a stone, a weapon which the\nGuanches used most skilfully. Mr. Sprat, confirmed by Glas, affirms that\nthey ’throw Stones with a force almost as great as that of a Bullet, and\nnow use Stones in all their fights as they did antiently.’",
        "No. 4, much smaller than the two former, was the best preserved. The\nshape of the skull and pelvis suggested a female; the arms also were\ncrossed in front over the body, whereas in the male mummy they were laid\nstraight. The legs were covered with skin; the hands were remarkably\nwell preserved, and the nails were darker than other parts. The tongue,\nin all four, was absent, having probably decayed.",
        "These crania were distinctly oval. The facial angle, well opened, and\nranging from 80° to 85°, counterbalanced the great development of the\nface, which showed an animal type. A little hair remained, coloured\nruddy-chestnut and straight, not woolly. The entrails had disappeared,\nand the abdominal walls not existing, it was impossible to detect the\nincisions by which the tanno-balsamic substances, noted by Bory de\nSaint-Vincent and many others, were introduced. The method appears\nuncertain. It is generally believed that after removing the entrails\nthrough an irregular cut made with the tabona, or obsidian\n(knife), the operators, who, as in Egypt, were of the lowest caste,\ninjected a corrosive fluid. They then filled the cavities with the\nbalsam described above; dried the corpse; and, after, fifteen to twenty\ndays, sewed it up in tanned goatskins. Such appears to have been the\ncase with the mummies under consideration.",
        "The catacombs, inviolable except to the sacrilegious, were numerous in\nthe rockiest and least accessible parts of the island. Mr. Addison found\nthem in the Cañádas del Pico, 7,700 feet above sea-level. [Footnote:\nTenerife: ’An Ascent of the Peak and Sketch of the Island,’ by Robert\nEdward Alison. Quarterly Journal of Science, Jan. 1806.] Hence it\nhas been remarked of the Guanches that, after a century of fighting,\nnothing remained of them but their mummies. The sharp saying is rather\nterse than true.",
        "The Guanches were barbarians, not savages. De Béthencourt’s two\nchaplains, speaking in their chronicle of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura,\ntell us ’there are many villages and houses, with numerous inhabitants.’\nThe ruins still found in the Isles are called ’casas hondas’ (\"deep\nhouses”); because a central excavation was surrounded by a low wall. The\ncastle of Zonzamas was built of large stones without lime. In Port\nArguineguin (Grand Canary) the explorers sent by Alfonso IV. (1341) came\nupon 300 to 400 tenements roofed with valuable wood, and so clean inside\nthat they seemed stuccoed. They encircled a larger building, probably\nthe residence of the chief. But the Tenerifans used only caves.",
        "The want of canoes and other navigating appliances in Guanche-land by no\nmeans proves that the emigration took place when the Canaries formed\npart of the Continent. The same was the case with the Australians, the\nTasmanians, and the New Zealanders. The Guanches, at the same time, were\nadmirable swimmers, easily able to cross the strait, nine miles wide,\nseparating Lanzarote from La Graciosa. They could even kill fish with\nsticks when in the water. The fattening of girls before marriage was,\nand is still, a Moroccan, not an Arab custom. The rude feudalism much\nresembled that of the Bedawi chiefs. George Glas, [Footnote: The\nHistory of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands,\n&c. 4to. London, 1764. I have given some notices of the unfortunate\n’master mariner’ in Wanderings in West Africa, vol. i. p. 79] or\nrather Abreu Galindo, his author, says of their marriages, ’None of the\nCanarians had more than one wife, and the wife one husband, contrary to\nwhat misinformed authors affirm.’ The general belief is that at the time\nof the conquest polyandry prevailed amongst the tribes. It may have\noriginated from their rude community of goods, and probably it became a\nlocal practice in order to limit population. Possibly, too, it was\nconfined to the noble and the priestly orders.",
        "Humboldt remarks, [Footnote: Personal Narrative, chap, i. p. 32,\nBohn’s ed. London, 1852.] ’We find no example of this polyandry except\namongst the people of Thibet.’ Yet he must have heard of the Nayr of\nMalabar, if not of the Todas on the Nilagiri Hills. D. Agustin Millares\n[Footnote: Historia de la Gran Canaria. Published at Las Palmas.]\nexplains the custom by ’men and women being born in almost equal\nproportions,’ the reverse being the fact. Equal proportions induce the\nmonogamic relation.",
        "Learned M. d’Avezac derives ’Guanche’ from Guansheri or Guanseri, a\nBerber tribe described by El-Idrisi and Leo Africanus. This is better\nthan finding it in the Keltic gwuwrn, gwen, white. Older\nauthorities hold it a corruption of ’Vinchune,’ the indigenous name of\nthe Nivarian race. Again, ’the inhabitants of Tenerife called themselves\nGuan (the Berber Wan), one person, Chinet or Chinerf, Tenerife; so that\nGuanchinet meant a man of Tenerife, and was easily corrupted to\nGuanche. Thus, too, Glas’s ’Captain Artemis’ was Guan-arteme, the one or\nchief ruler. Vieira derives ’Tenerf’ or’Chenerf’ from the last king; and\nold MSS. have ’Chenerife.’ The popular voice says it is composed of\n’Tener,’ mountain or snow, and of ’ryfe,’ snow or mountain. Pritchard\n[Footnote: Researches into the Physical History of Mankind, book\niii. chap. ii.] applied the term Guanche to all the Canarian races, and\nhe is reproached for error by M. de Macedo, [Footnote: ’Ethnological\nRemarks,’ &c., by J. J. de Costa de Macedo, of Lisbon, Royal\nGeographical Society’s Journal, vol. ii. p. 172. Wanderings in\nWest Africa, i. 116, contains my objections to his theory.] who\nwould limit it to the Tenerifans. The same occurs in the Eev. Mr. Delany\n[Footnote: Notes of a Residence in the Canary Islands,\n&c. London, 1861.]  and in Professor Piazzi Smyth, [Footnote: An\nAstronomer’s Experiment, p. 190. L. Reeve, London, 1868.] who speaks\nof the ’Guanches of Grand Canary and Teneriffe.’ According to popular\nusage all were right, ’Guanche’ being the local and general term for the\naborigines of the whole archipelago. But the scientific object that it\nincludes under the same name several different races.",
        "The language is also a point of dispute: some opine that all the\nislanders had one tongue, others that they were mutually unintelligible;\nmany that it was Berber (Numidian, Getulian, and Garamantan), a few that\nit was less distinctly Semitic. The two chaplains of De Béthencourt\n[Footnote: Bontier and Le Verrier, Histoire de la première Découverte\ne Conquête des Canaries. Bergeron, Paris, 1630.] noted its\nresemblance with that of the ’Moors’ of Barbary. Glas, who knew\nsomething of Shilha, or Western Berber, made the same observation. But\nthe Genoese pilot Niccoloso di Recco during the expedition of A.D. 1344\ncollected the numerals, and two of these, satti (7) and\ntamatti (8), are less near the original than the Berberan\nset and tem.",
        "The catalogue of Abreu Galindo, who lived here in 1591 and printed his\nhistory in 1632, preserves 122 words; Vieira only 107, and Bory de\nSaint-Vincent [Footnote: Essai sur les Iles fortunées. Humboldt\nhas only five.] 148. Webb and Berthelot give 909. Of these 200 are\nnouns, including 22 names of plants; 467 are placenames, and 242 are\nproper names. Many are questionable. For instance, sabor\n(council-place) is derived from cabocer, ’expression par laquelle\nles nègres de la Sénégambie dénotent la réunion de leurs chefs.’\n[Footnote: Vol. i. part i. p. 223.] As all know, it is the corrupted\nPortuguese caboceiro, a headman.",
        "Continuing our way from Tacoronte we reached Sauzal, beyond which the\ncoach did not then run; the old road was out of condition, and the new\nnot in working order. We offered a dollar each for carrying our light\ngear to sturdy men who were loitering and lying about the premises. They\nshook their heads, wrapped their old blanket-cloaks around them, and\nstretched themselves in the sun like dogs after a cold walk. I could\nhardly wonder. What wants have they? A covering for warmth, porridge for\nfood, and, above all, the bright sun and pure air, higher luxuries and\nbetter eudaemonics than purple and fine linen. At last some passing\nmuleteers relieved us of the difficulty.",
        "The way was crowded with Laguneros, conspicuous in straw-hats; cloth\njackets, red waistcoats embroidered at the back; bright crimson sashes;\nwhite knickerbockers, with black velveteen overalls, looking as if\n’pointed’ before and behind; brown hose or long leather gaiters\nornamented with colours, and untanned shoes. Despite the heat many wore\nthe Guanche cloak, a blanket (English) with a running string round the\nneck. The women covered their graceful heads with a half-square of white\nstuff, and deformed the coiffure by a hideous black billycock, an\nunpleasant memory of Wales. Some hundreds of men, women, and children\nwere working on the road, and we were surprised by the beauty of the\nrace, its classical outlines, oval contours, straight profiles,\nmagnificent hair, and blue-grey eyes with black lashes. This is not the\nresult of Guanche blood, as a town on the south-western part of the\nisland presently showed me. Also an orderly of Guanche breed from the\nparts about Arico, who had served for years at the palace, was pointed\nout as a type. He stood six feet four, with proportional breadth; his\nface was somewhat lozenge-shaped, his hair straight, black like a\nHindu’s, and his tawny skin looked only a little darker than that of\nPortuguese Algarves. The beauty of the islanders results from a mixture\nof Irish blood. During the Catholic persecution before 1823 many fled\nthe Emerald Isle to Tenerife, and especially to Orotava. The women’s\nfigures in youth are charming, tall, straight, and pliant as their own\npine-trees. All remark their graceful gait.",
        "We passed through places famed in the days of the conquest–La Matanza,\nthe native Orantapata, where De Lugo’s force was nearly annihilated. Now\nit is the half-way station to Orotava; and here the coche stops\nfor dinner, prices being regulated by Government. The single inn shows\nthe Pike, but not the subjacent valley. Then to Acentejo, the local\nRoncesvalles, where the invaders were saved only by St. Michael; and\nnext to La Vitoria, where they avenged themselves. At Santa Ursula we\nfirst saw the slopes of Orotava, the Guanche Tavro or Atanpalata; and on\nthe Cuesta de la Villa we were shown near its mark, a date-palm, the\ncave that sheltered the patriot chief, unfortunate Bencomo. As the\nfashionables came forth to walk and drive we passed the calvario\nand the place leading to the Villa Orotava, and found quarters in\nthe fonda of D. José Gobea. The sala, or chief room, some\n30 feet long, wanted only an Eastern divan round the walls; it was\neasily converted into a tolerable place of bivouac, and here we resolved\nto try country life for a while.",
        "The first aspect of the Orotava Tempe was disappointing after Humboldt’s\ndictum, ’Voici ce qu’il y a de plus délicieux au monde.’  But our\ndisappointment was the natural reaction of judgment from fancy to\nreality, which often leads to a higher appreciation. At last we learned\nwhy the Elysian [Footnote: In Arabic El-Lizzat, the Delight, or from the\nold Egyptian Aahlu,] Fields, the Fortunate Islands, the Garden of\nthe Hesperides–where the sea is no longer navigable, and where Atlas\nsupports the firmament on a mountain conical as a cylinder; the land of\nevening, of sunset, where Helios sinks into the sea, and where Night\nbore the guardians of the golden apples–were such favourites with the\npoets. And we came to love every feature of the place, from the snowy\nPike of Teyde flushing pink in the morning sun behind his lofty rampart,\nto the Puerto, or lower town, whose three several reef-gates are outlaid\nby creamy surf, and whose every shift of form and hue stands distinct in\nthe transparent and perfumed air. The intermediate slopes are clothed\nwith a vegetation partly African, partly European; and here Humboldt, at\nthe end of the last century, proposed to naturalise the chinchona.",
        "La Villa lies some two miles and a half from and about 1,140 feet above\nthe Puerto; and the streets are paved and precipitous as any part of\nFunchal. The population varied from 7,000 to 8,000 souls, whereas the\nlower town had only 3,500. It contains a few fine houses with huge\nhanging balconies and interior patios (courts) which would\naccommodate a regiment. They date from the ’gente muy caballerosa’\n(knightly folk) of three centuries ago. The feminine population appeared\nexcessive, the reason being that some five per cent. of the youths go to\nHavannah and after a few years return ’Indianos,’ or ’Indios,’ our old\n’nabobs.’",
        "At the Puerto we were most kindly received by the late British\nVice-Consul, Mr. Goodall, who died about the normal age, seventy-seven:\nif this be safely passed man in Tenerife becomes a macrobian. All was\ndone for our comfort by the late Mr. Carpenter, who figures in the\n’Astronomer’s Experiment’ as ’the interpreter.’  Amongst the scanty\npublic diversions was the Opera. The Villa theatre occupied an ancient\nchurch: the length of the building formed pit, boxes, and gallery; and\n’La Sonnambula’ descended exactly where the high altar had been. At the\nPuerto an old monastery was chosen for ’La Traviata:’ the latter was\nrealistic as Crabbe’s poetry; even in bed the unfortunate ’Misled’ one\ncould not do without a certain truncated cylinder of acajou. I sighed\nfor the Iberian ’Zarzuela,’ that most charming opera buffa which\ntakes its name from a ’pleasaunce’ in the Pardo Palace near Madrid.",
        "The hotel diet was peculiarly Spanish; already the stews and ’pilaffs’\n(puláos) of the East begin in embryo. The staple dish was the\npuchero, or cocido, which antiquated travellers still call\n’olla podrida’ (pot-pourri). This lesso or bouilli consists\nof soup, beef, bacon, and garbanzos (chick-peas, or Cicer\narietinium) in one plate, and boiled potatoes and small gourds\n(bubangos) in another. The condiments are mostly garlic\nand saffron, preferred to mustard and chillies. The pastry, they tell\nme, is excellent.",
        "In those days the Great Dragon Tree had not yet lost its upper cone by\nthe dreadful storm of January 3, 1868; thus it had survived by two\ncenturies and a half the Garoe Laurel, or Arbol Santo, the miraculous\ntree of Hierro (Ferro). It stood in the garden of the Marquez de Sauzal,\nwho would willingly have preserved it. But every traveller had his own\ninfallible recipe, and the proprietor contented himself with propping up\nthe lower limbs by poles. It stood upon a raised bank of masonry-work,\nand the north-east side showed a huge cavity which had been stopped with\nstone and lime. About half a century ago one-third came down, and in\n1819 an arm was torn off and sent, I believe, to Kew. When we saw the\nfragment it looked mostly like tinder, or touchwood, ’eld-gamall,’\nstone-old, as the Icelanders say. Near it stood a pair of tall\ncypresses, and at some distance a venerable palm-tree, which ’relates to\nit,’ according to Count Gabriel de Belcastel,",
        "[Footnote: I quote from the Spanish translation, Las Islas Canarias y\nel Valle Orotava, a highly popular work contrasting wonderfully with\nsome of ours. The courteous Frenchman even promised that Morocco would\nbe the Algeria of the Canaries. His observations for temperature,\npressure, variation, hygrometry, and psychrometry of the Orotavan\nclimate, which he chose for health, are valuable. He starts with a\ntheory of the three conditions of salubrity–heat-and-cold, humidity,\nand atmospheric change. The average annual mean of Orotava is 66.34\ndegrees (F.), that of Southern France in September; it never falls below\n54.5 degrees nor rises above 73.88 degrees, nor exceeds 13.88 degrees in\nvariation.]",
        "’in the murmurs of the breeze the legends of races long disappeared.’",
        "Naturalists modestly assigned to the old Dragon 5,000 to 10,000 years,\nthus giving birth to fine reflections about its witnessing revolutions\nwhich our planet underwent prior to the advent of man. So Adamson made\nhis calabash a contemporary of the Noachian Deluge, if that partial\ncataclysm [Footnote: The ancient Egyptians, who ignored the Babylonian\nDeluge, well knew that all cataclysms are local, not general,\ncatastrophes.] ever reached Africa. The Orotava relic certainly was an\nold tree, prophetic withal, [Footnote: It was supposed infallibly to\npredict weather and to regulate sowing-time. Thus if the southern side\nflowered first drought was to be expected, and vice versa. Now the\npeasant refers to San Isidro, patron of Orotava: he has only changed the\nform of his superstition.] when De Lugo and the conquistadores\nentered the valley in 1493 and said mass in its hollow. But that event\nwas only four centuries ago, and dates are ticklish things when derived\nfrom the rings and wrinkles of little-studied vegetation. Already\nMr. Diston, in a letter to Professor Piazzi Smyth, [Footnote:\n’Astronomical Experiment on the Peak of Tenerife,’ Philosoph.\nTrans., part ii. for 1858.]  declared that a young ’dragon,’\nwhich he had planted in 1818, became in 38 years so tall that\na ladder was required to reach the head. And let us observe that Nature,\nthough forbidden such style of progression by her savans,\nsometimes does make a local saltus, especially in the change of\nclimates. Centuries ago, when the fires about Teyde were still alight,\nand the lava-fields about Orotava were still burning, the rate of\ndraconian increase, under the influence of heat and moisture, might have\nbeen treble or quadruple what it would now be.",
        "[Footnote: The patriarch was no ’giant of the forest.’ Its stature did\nnot exceed 60 feet. Humboldt made it only 45 French feet(= 47 ft. ll\nins. English) round the base. Dr. Wilde (Narrative, p. 40) blames\nthe measurer and gives about the same measurement, Professor Piazzi\nSmyth, who in 1856 reproduced it in an abominable photo-stenograph,\nreckons 48.5 feet at the level of the southern foot, 35.6 feet at 6 feet\nabove the ground, and 28.8 feet at 14.5 feet, where branches spring from\nthe rapidly narrowing conical trunk. The same are said to have been its\nproportions in the days of the conquest. In 1866 Mr. Addison made it 60\nfeet tall, 35.5 feet at 6 feet from the ground, and 49.5 in\ncircumference at the base which he cleared. Mr. Barker Webb’s sketch in\n1830 was the best; but the tree afterwards greatly changed.\nMr. J. J. Williams made a neat drawing in boarding-school\nstyle, with a background apparently borrowed from Richmond Hill.]",
        "The Jardin de Aclimatacion, or Botanical Garden, mentioned by Humboldt",
        "[Footnote: Page 59. It is regretable that his forecasts have\nfailed. Neither of the ohinohonas (C. tanoifolia and C.\noblongifolia) has been naturalised in Southern Europe. Nor has\nthe Hill of Duragno yet sent us the ’protea, the psidium, the jambos,\nthe chirimoya of Peru, the sensitive plant, the heliconia, and several\nbeautiful species of glyoine from New Holland.’]",
        "as far back as 1799, still flourishes. It was founded in 1788-95 by an\nable savan, the Marquis de Villanueva del Pardo (D. Alonso de\nNava y Grimon), who to a Government grant of 1,000l. added\n4,000l. of his own, besides 400l. a year for an average\ngeneration. The place is well chosen, for the Happy Valley combines the\nflora of the north and the south, with a Nivaria of snow-land above it\nand a semi-tropical temperature on the shores of the ’Chronian Sea.’",
