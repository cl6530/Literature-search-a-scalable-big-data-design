        "The Fourth of July orator for 1826 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nwas Edward Everett. Although only thirty-two he was already a\ndistinguished speaker. In the course of his oration he\napostrophized John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as venerable\nsurvivors of that momentous day, fifty years earlier, which had\nwitnessed our Declaration of Independence. But even as Everett\nwas speaking, the aged author of the Declaration breathed his\nlast at Monticello, and in the afternoon of that same day Adams\ndied also, murmuring, it is said, with his latest breath, and as\nif with the whimsical obstinacy of an old man who hated to be\nbeaten by his ancient rival, “Thomas Jefferson still lives.” But\nJefferson was already gone.",
        "On the first of August, Everett commemorated the career of the\ntwo Revolutionary leaders, and on the following day a greater\nthan Everett, Daniel Webster, pronounced the famous eulogy in\nFaneuil Hall. Never were the thoughts and emotions of a whole\ncountry more adequately voiced than in this commemorative\noratory. Its pulse was high with national pride over the\naccomplishments of half a century. “I ask,” Everett declared,\n“whether more has not been done to extend the domain of\ncivilization, in fifty years, since the Declaration of\nIndependence, than would have been done in five centuries of\ncontinued colonial subjection?” Webster asserted in his\nperoration: “It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute\nagainst the sun, that with America, and in America, a new era\ncommences in human affairs. This era is distinguished by free\nrepresentative governments, by entire religious liberty, by\nimproved systems of national intercourse, by a newly awakened and\nan unconquerable spirit of free enquiry, and by a diffusion of\nknowledge through the community such as has been before\naltogether unknown and unheard of.”",
        "Was this merely the “tall talk” then so characteristic of\nAmerican oratory and soon to be satirized in “Martin Chuzzlewit”?\nOr was it prompted by a deep and true instinct for the\nsignificance of the vast changes that had come over American life\nsince 1776? The external changes were familiar enough to\nWebster’s auditors: the opening of seemingly illimitable\nterritory through the Louisiana Purchase, the development of\nroads, canals, and manufactures; a rapid increase in wealth and\npopulation; a shifting of political power due to the rise of the\nnew West–in a word, the evidences of irrepressible national\nenergy. But this energy was inadequately expressed by the\nnational literature. The more cultivated Americans were quite\naware of this deficiency. It was confessed by the pessimistic\nFisher Ames and by the ardent young men who in 1815 founded “The\nNorth American Review.” British critics in “The Edinburgh” and\n“The Quarterly,” commenting upon recent works of travel in\nAmerica, pointed out the literary poverty of the American soil.\nSydney Smith, by no means the most offensive of these critics,\ndeclared in 1820: “During the thirty or forty years of their\nindependence they have done absolutely nothing for the sciences,\nfor the arts, for literature . . . . In the four quarters of the\nglobe, who reads an American book? or goes to an American play?\nor looks at an American picture or statue?”",
        "Sydney Smith’s question “Who reads an American book?” has\noutlived all of his own clever volumes. Even while he was asking\nit, London was eagerly reading Irving’s “Sketch Book.” In 1821\ncame Fenimore Cooper’s Spy and Bryant’s “Poems,” and by 1826,\nwhen Webster was announcing in his rolling orotund that Adams and\nJefferson were no more, the London and Paris booksellers were\ncovering their stalls with Cooper’s “The Last of the Mohicans.\"\nIrving, Cooper, and Bryant are thus the pioneers in a new phase\nof American literary activity, often called, for convenience in\nlabeling, the Knickerbocker Group because of the identification\nof these men with New York. And close behind these leaders come a\nyounger company, destined likewise, in the shy boyish words of\nHawthorne, one of the number, “to write books that would be read\nin England.” For by 1826 Hawthorne and Longfellow were out of\ncollege and were trying to learn to write. Ticknor, Prescott, and\nBancroft, somewhat older men, were settling to their great tasks.\nEmerson was entering upon his duties as a minister. Edgar Allan\nPoe, at that University of Virginia which Jefferson had just\nfounded, was doubtless revising “Tamerlane and Other Poems” which\nhe was to publish in Boston in the following year. Holmes was a\nHarvard undergraduate. Garrison had just printed Whittier’s first\npublished poem in the Newburyport “Free Press.” Walt Whitman was\na barefooted boy on Long Island, and Lowell, likewise seven years\nof age, was watching the birds in the treetops of Elmwood. But it\nwas Washington Irving who showed all of these men that nineteenth\ncentury England would be interested in American books.",
        "The very word Knickerbocker is one evidence of the vitality of\nIrving’s happy imaginings. In 1809 he had invented a mythical\nDutch historian of New York named Diedrich Knickerbocker and\nfathered upon him a witty parody of Dr. Mitchill’s grave “Picture\nof New York.” To read Irving’s chapters today is to witness one\nof the rarest and most agreeable of phenomena, namely, the actual\nbeginning of a legend which the world is unwilling to let die.\nThe book made Sir Walter Scott’s sides ache with laughter, and\nreminded him of the humor of Swift and Sterne. But certain New\nYorkers were slow to see the joke.",
        "Irving was himself a New Yorker, born just at the close of the\nRevolution, of a Scotch father and English mother. His youth was\npleasantly idle, with a little random education, much\ntheater-going, and plentiful rambles with a gun along the Hudson\nRiver. In 1804 he went abroad for his health, returned and helped\nto write the light social satire of the “Salmagundi Papers,” and\nbecame, after the publication of the “Knickerbocker History,” a\nlocal celebrity. Sailing for England in 1815 on business, he\nstayed until 1832 as a roving man of letters in England and Spain\nand then as Secretary of the American Legation in London. “The\nSketch Book,” “Bracebridge Hall,” and “Tales of a Traveler” are\nthe best known productions of Irving’s fruitful residence in\nEngland. The “Life of Columbus,” the “Conquest of Granada,” and\n“The Alhambra” represent his first sojourn in Spain. After his\nreturn to America he became fascinated with the Great West, made\nthe travels described in his “Tour of the Prairies,” and told the\nstory of roving trappers and the fur trade in “Captain\nBonneville” and “Astoria.” For four years he returned to Spain as\nAmerican Minister. In his last tranquil years at Sunnyside on the\nHudson, where he died in 1859, he wrote graceful lives of\nGoldsmith and of Washington.",
        "Such a glance at the shelf containing Irving’s books suggests but\nlittle of that personal quality to which he owes his significance\nas an interpreter of America to the Old World. This son of a\nnarrow, hard, Scotch dealer in cutlery, this drifter about town\nwhen New York was only a big slovenly village, this light-hearted\nscribbler of satire and sentiment, was a gentleman born. His\nboyhood and youth were passed in that period of\nPost-Revolutionary reaction which exhibits the United States in\nsome of its most unlovely aspects. Historians like Henry Adams\nand McMaster have painted in detail the low estate of education,\nreligion, and art as the new century began. The bitter feeling of\nthe nascent nation toward Great Britain was intensified by the\nWar of 1812. The Napoleonic Wars had threatened to break the last\nthreads of our friendship for France, and suspicion of the Holy\nAlliance led to an era of national self-assertion of which the\nMonroe Doctrine was only one expression. The raw Jacksonism of\nthe West seemed to be gaining upon the older civilizations\nrepresented by Virginia and Massachusetts. The self-made type of\nman began to pose as the genuine American. And at this moment\ncame forward a man of natural lucidity and serenity of mind, of\nperfect poise and good temper, who knew both Europe and America\nand felt that they ought to know one another better and to like\none another more. That was Irving’s service as an international\nmediator. He diffused sweetness and light in an era marked by\nbitterness and obscuration. It was a triumph of character as well\nas of literary skill.",
        "But the skill was very noticeable also. Irving’s prose is not\nthat of the Defoe-Swift-Franklin-Paine type of plain talk to the\ncrowd. It is rather an inheritance from that other eighteenth\ncentury tradition, the conversation of the select circle. Its\naccents were heard in Steele and Addison and were continued in\nGoldsmith, Sterne, Cowper, and Charles Lamb. Among Irving’s\nsuccessors, George William Curtis and Charles Dudley Warner and\nWilliam Dean Howells have been masters of it likewise. It is\nmellow human talk, delicate, regardful, capable of exquisite\nmodulation. With instinctive artistic taste, Irving used this old\nand sound style upon fresh American material. In “Rip van Winkle\"\nand “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” he portrayed his native valley\nof the Hudson, and for a hundred years connoisseurs of style have\nperceived the exquisite fitness of the language to the images and\nideas which Irving desired to convey. To render the Far West of\nthat epoch this style is perhaps not “big” and broad enough, but\nwhen used as Irving uses it in describing Stratford and\nWestminster Abbey and an Old English Christmas, it becomes again\na perfect medium. Hawthorne adopted it for “Our Old Home,” and\nEnglishmen recognized it at once as a part of their own\ninheritance, enriched, like certain wines, by the voyage across\nthe Atlantic and home again. Irving wrote of England, Mr. Warner\nonce said, as Englishmen would have liked to write about it. When\nhe described the Alhambra and Granada and the Moors, it was the\nstyle, rich both in physical sensation and in dreamlike reverie,\nwhich revealed to the world the quick American appreciation of\nforeign scenes and characters. Its key is sympathy.",
        "Irving’s popularity has endured in England. It suffered during\nthe middle of the century in his own country, for the strongest\nNew England authors taught the public to demand more thought and\npassion than were in Irving’s nature. Possibly the nervous,\njournalistic style of the twentieth century allows too scanty\nleisure of mind for the full enjoyment of the Knickerbocker\nflavor. Yet such changes as these in literary fashion scarcely\naffect the permanent service of Irving to our literature. He\nimmortalized a local type–the New York Dutchman–and local\nlegends, like that of Rip van Winkle; he used the framework of\nthe narrative essay to create something almost like the perfected\nshort story of Poe and Hawthorne; he wrote prose with unfailing\ncharm in an age when charm was lacking; and, if he had no\nmessage, it should be remembered that some of the most useful\nambassadors have had none save to reveal, with delicacy and tact\nand humorous kindness, the truth that foreign persons have\nfeelings precisely like our own.",
        "Readers of Sir Walter Scott’s “Journal” may remember his account\nof an evening party in Paris in 1826 where he met Fenimore\nCooper, then in the height of his European reputation. “So the\nScotch and American lions took the field together,” wrote Sir\nWalter, who loved to be generous. “The Last of the Mohicans,\"\nthen just published, threatened to eclipse the fame of “Ivanhoe.\"\nCooper, born in 1789, was eighteen years younger than the Wizard\nof the North, and was more deeply indebted to him than he knew.\nFor it was Scott who had created the immense nineteenth century\naudience for prose fiction, and who had evolved a kind of formula\nfor the novel, ready for Cooper’s use. Both men were natural\nstory-tellers. Scott had the richer mind and the more fully\ndeveloped historical imagination. Both were out-of-doors men,\nlovers of manly adventure and of natural beauty. But the American\nhad the good fortune to be able to utilize in his books his\npersonal experiences of forest and sea and to reveal to Europe\nthe real romance of the American wilderness.",
        "That Cooper was the first to perceive the artistic possibilities\nof this romance, no one would claim. Brockden Brown, a Quaker\nyouth of Philadelphia, a disciple of the English Godwin, had\ntried his hand at the very end of the eighteenth century upon\nAmerican variations of the Gothic romance then popular in\nEngland. Brown had a keen eye for the values of the American\nlandscape and even of the American Indian. He had a knack for\npassages of ghastly power, as his descriptions of maniacs,\nmurderers, sleep-walkers, and solitaries abundantly prove. But he\nhad read too much and lived too little to rival the masters of\nthe art of fiction. And there was a traveled Frenchman,\nChateaubriand, surely an expert in the art of eloquent prose, who\nhad transferred to the pages of his American Indian stories,\n“Atala” and “Rene,” the mystery and enchantment of our dark\nforests\nand endless rivers. But Chateaubriand, like Brockden Brown, is\nfeverish. A taint of old-world eroticism and despair hovers like\na miasma over his magnificent panorama of the wilderness. Cooper,\nlike Scott, is masculine.",
        "He was a Knickerbocker only by adoption. Born in New Jersey, his\nchildhood was spent in the then remote settlement of Cooperstown\nin Central New York. He had a little schooling at Albany, and a\nbrief and inglorious career at Yale with the class of 1806. He\nwent to sea for two years, and then served for three years in the\nUnited States Navy upon Lakes Ontario and Champlain, the very\nscene of some of his best stories. In 1811 he married, resigned\nfrom the Navy, and settled upon a little estate in Westchester\nCounty, near New York. Until the age of thirty, he was not in the\nleast a bookman, but a healthy, man of action. Then, as the\nwell-known anecdote goes, he exclaims to his wife, after reading\na stupid English novel, “I believe I could write a better story\nmyself.” “Precaution” (1820) was the result, but whether it was\nbetter than the unknown English book, no one can now say. It was\nbad enough. Yet the next year Cooper published “The Spy,” one of\nthe finest of his novels, which was instantly welcomed in England\nand translated in France. Then came, in swift succession, “The\nPioneers,” the first Leather-Stocking tale in order of\ncomposition, and “The Pilot,” to show that Scott’s “Pirate” was\nwritten by a landsman! “Lionel Lincoln” and “The Last of the\nMohicans” followed. The next seven years were spent in Europe,\nmainly in France, where “The Prairie” and “The Red Rover” were\nwritten. Cooper now looked back upon his countrymen with eyes of\ncritical detachment, and made ready to tell them some of their\nfaults. He came home to Cooperstown in 1833, the year after\nIrving’s return to America. He had won, deservedly, a great fame,\nwhich he proceeded to imperil by his combativeness with his\nneighbors and his harsh strictures upon the national character,\ndue mainly to his lofty conception of the ideal America. He\ncontinued to spin yarns of sea and shore, and to write naval\nhistory. The tide of fashion set against him in the\neighteen-forties when Bulwer and Dickens rode into favor, but the\nstouthearted old pioneer could afford to bide his time. He died\nin 1851, just as Mrs. Stowe was writing “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”",
        "Two generations have passed since then, and Cooper’s place in our\nliterature remains secure. To have written our first historical\nnovel, “The Spy,” our first sea-story, “The Pilot,” and to have\ncreated the Leather-Stocking series, is glory enough. In his\nperception of masculine character, Cooper ranks with Fielding.\nHis sailors, his scouts and spies, his good and bad Indians, are\nas veritable human figures as Squire Western. Long Tom Coffin,\nHarvey Birch, Hawk-Eye, and Chingachgook are physically and\nmorally true to life itself. Read the Leather-Stocking books in\nthe order of the events described, beginning with “The\nDeerslayer,” then “The Last of the Mohicans,” “The Pathfinder,\"\n“The Pioneers”, and ending with the vast darkening horizon of\n“The Prairie” and the death of the trapper, and one will feel how\nnatural and inevitable are the fates of the personages and the\nalterations in the life of the frontier. These books vary in\ntheir poetic quality and in the degree of their realism, but to\nwatch the evolution of the leading figure is to see human life in\nits actual texture.",
        "Clever persons and pedantic persons have united to find fault\nwith certain elements of Cooper’s art. Mark Twain, in one of his\nleast inspired moments, selected Cooper’s novels for attack.\nEvery grammar school teacher is ready to point out that his style\nis often prolix and his sentences are sometimes ungrammatical.\nAmateurs even criticize Cooper’s seamanship, although it seemed\nimpeccable to Admiral Mahan. No doubt one must admit the\n“helplessness, propriety, and incapacity” of most of Cooper’s\nwomen, and the dreadfulness of his bores, particularly the\nScotchmen, the doctors, and the naturalists. Like Sir Walter,\nCooper seems to have taken but little pains in the deliberate\nplanning of his plots. Frequently he accepts a ready-made formula\nof villain and hero, predicament and escape, renewed crisis and\nrescue, mystification and explanation, worthy of a third-rate\nnovelist. His salvation lies in his genius for action, the beauty\nand grandeur of his landscapes, the primitive veracity of his\nchildren of nature. Cooper was an elemental man, and he\ncomprehended, by means of something deeper than mere artistic\ninstinct, the feelings of elemental humanity in the presence of\nthe wide ocean or of the deep woods. He is as healthy and sane as\nFielding, and he possesses an additional quality which all of the\npurely English novelists lack. It was the result of his youthful\nsojourn in the wilderness. Let us call it the survival in him of\nan aboriginal imagination. Cooper reminds one somehow of a\nmoose–an ungraceful creature perhaps, but indubitably big, as\nmany a hunter has suddenly realized when he has come unexpectedly\nupon a moose that whirled to face him in the twilight silence of\na northern wood.",
        "Something of this far-off and gigantic primitivism inheres also\nin the poetry of William Cullen Bryant. His portrait, with the\nsweeping white beard and the dark folds of the cloak, suggests\nthe Bard as the Druids might have known him. But in the\neighteen-thirties and forties, Mr. Bryant’s alert, clean-shaven\nface, and energetic gait as he strode down Broadway to the\n“Evening Post” office, suggested little more than a vigorous and\nsomewhat radical editor of an increasingly prosperous Democratic\nnewspaper. There was nothing of the Fringed Gentian or Yellow\nViolet about him. Like so many of the Knickerbockers, Bryant was\nan immigrant to New York; in fact, none of her adopted men of\nletters have represented so perfectly the inherited traits of the\nNew England Puritan. To understand his long, and honorable public\nlife it is necessary to know something of the city of his choice,\nbut to enter into the spirit of his poetry one must go back to\nthe hills of western Massachusetts.",
        "Bryant had a right to his cold-weather mind. He came from\nMayflower stock. His father, Dr. Peter Bryant of Cummington, was\na sound country physician, with liberal preferences in theology,\nFederalist views in politics, and a library of seven hundred\nvolumes, rich in poetry. The poet’s mother records his birth in\nher diary in terse words which have the true Spartan tang: “Nov.\n3, 1794. Stormy, wind N. E. Churned. Seven in the evening a son\nborn.” Two days later the November wind shifted. “Nov. 5, 1794.\nClear, wind N. W. Made Austin a coat. Sat up all day. Went into\nthe kitchen.” The baby, it appears, had an abnormally large head\nand was dipped, day after day, in rude hydropathy, into an icy\nspring. A precocious childhood was followed by a stern, somewhat\nunhappy, but aspiring boyhood. The little fellow, lying prone\nwith his brothers before the firelight of the kitchen, reading\nEnglish poetry from his father’s library, used to pray that he\ntoo might become a poet. At thirteen he produced a satire on\nJefferson, “The Embargo,” which his proud Federalist father\nprinted\nat Boston in 1808. The youth had nearly one year at Williams\nCollege, over the mountain ranges to the west. He wished to\ncontinue his education at Yale, but his father had no money for\nthis greater venture, and the son remained at home. There, in the\nautumn of 1811, on the bleak hills, he composed the first draft\nof “Thanatopsis.” He was seventeen, and he had been reading\nBlair’s “Grave” and the poems of the consumptive Henry Kirke\nWhite.\nHe hid his verses in a drawer, and five years later his father\nfound them, shed tears over them, and sent them to the “North\nAmerican Review,” where they were published in September, 1817.",
        "In the meantime the young man had studied law, though with\ndislike of it, and with the confession that he sometimes read\n“The Lyrical Ballads” when he might have been reading Blackstone.\nOne December afternoon in 1815, he was walking from Cummington to\nPlainfield–aged twenty-one, and looking for a place in which to\nsettle as a lawyer. Across the vivid sunset flew a black duck, as\nsolitary and homeless as himself. The bird seemed an image of his\nown soul, “lone wandering but not lost.” Before he slept that\nnight he had composed the poem “To a Waterfowl.” No more\nauthentic inspiration ever visited a poet, and though Bryant\nwrote verse for more than sixty years after that crimson sky had\npaled into chill December twilight, his lines never again\nvibrated with such communicative passion.",
        "Bryant’s ensuing career revealed the steady purpose, the\nstoicism, the reticence of the Puritan. It was highly successful,\njudged even by material standards. “Thanatopsis” had been\ninstantly regarded in 1817 as the finest poem yet produced in\nAmerica. The author was invited to contribute to the “North\nAmerican Review” an essay on American poetry, and this, like all\nof Bryant’s prose work, was admirably written. He delivered his\nHarvard Phi Beta Kappa poem, “The Ages,” in 1821, the year of\nEmerson’s graduation. After a brief practice of the law in Great\nBarrington, he entered in 1826 into the unpromising field of\njournalism in New York. While other young Knickerbockers wasted\ntheir literary strength on trifles and dissipated their moral\nenergies, Bryant held steadily to his daily task. His life in\ntown was sternly ascetic, but he allowed himself long walks in\nthe country, and he continued to meditate a somewhat thankless\nMuse. In 1832 he visited his brothers on the Illinois prairies,\nand stopped one day to chat with a “tall awkward uncouth lad” of\nracy conversational powers, who was leading his company of\nvolunteers into the Black Hawk War. The two men were destined to\nmeet again in 1860, when Bryant presided at that Cooper Union\naddress of Lincoln’s which revealed to New York and to the\ncountry that the former captain of volunteers was now a king of\nmen. Lincoln was embarrassed on that occasion, it is said, by\nBryant’s fastidious, dignified presence. Not so Nathaniel\nHawthorne, who had seen the poet in Rome, two years before.\n“There was a weary look in his face,” wrote Hawthorne, “as if he\nwere tired of seeing things and doing things. . . .He uttered\nneither passion nor poetry, but excellent good sense, and\naccurate information, on whatever subject transpired; a very\npleasant man to associate with, but rather cold, I should\nimagine, if one should seek to touch his heart with one’s own.\"\nSuch was the impression Bryant made upon less gifted men than\nHawthorne, as he lived out his long and useful life in the\nKnickerbocker city. Toward the close of it he was in great demand\nfor public occasions; and it was after delivering a speech\ndedicating a statue to Mazzini in Central Park in 1878, when\nBryant was eighty-four, that a fit of dizziness caused a fall\nwhich proved fatal to the venerable poet. It was just seventy\nyears since Dr. Peter Bryant had published his boy’s verses on\n“The Embargo.”",
        "Although Bryant’s poetry has never roused any vociferous\nexcitement, it has enduring qualities. The spiritual\npreoccupations of many a voiceless generation of New England\nPuritans found a tongue at last in this late-born son of theirs.\nThe determining mood of his best poems, from boyhood to old age,\nwas precisely that thought of transiency, “the eternal flow of\nthings,” which colored the imaginations of the first colonists.\nThis is the central motive of “Thanatopsis,” “To a Waterfowl,\"\n“The Rivulet,” “A Forest Hymn,” “An Evening Revery,” “The Crowded\nStreet,” “The Flood of Years.” All of these tell the same story\nof endless change and of endless abiding, of varying eddies in\nthe same mighty stream of human existence. Bryant faced the\nthought as calmly, as majestically, at seventeen as when he wrote\n“The Flood of Years” at eighty-two. He is a master of\ndescription, though he has slight gift for narrative or drama,\nand he rarely sounds the clear lyric note. But everywhere in his\nverse there is that cold purity of the winter hills in Western\nMassachusetts, something austere and elemental which reaches\nkindred spirits below the surface on which intellect and passion\nhave their play, something more primitive, indeed, than human\nintellect or passion and belonging to another mode of being,\nsomething “rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun.”",
        "A picture of the Knickerbocker era is not complete without its\nportraits of the minor figures in the literary life of New York\nup to the time of the Civil War. But the scope of the present\nvolume does not permit sketches of Paulding and Verplanck, of\nHalleck and his friend Drake, of N. P. Willis and Morris and\nWoodworth. Some of these are today only “single-poem” men, like\nPayne, the author of “Home Sweet Home,” just as Key, the author\nof “The Star-Spangled Banner,” is today a “single-poem” man of an\nearlier generation. Their names will be found in such limbos of\nthe dead as Griswold’s “Poets and Poetry of America” and Poe’s\n“Literati.” They knew “the town” in their day, and pleased its\nvery easily pleased taste. The short-lived literary magazines of\nthe eighteen-forties gave them their hour of glory. As\nrepresentatives of passing phases of the literary history of New\nYork their careers are not without sentimental interest, but few\nof them spoke to or for the country as a whole. Two figures,\nindeed, stand out in sharp contrast with those habitual strollers\non Broadway and frequenters of literary gatherings, though each\nof them was for a while a part of Knickerbocker New York. To all\nappearances they were only two more Bohemians like the rest, but\nthe curiosity of the twentieth century sets them apart from their\nforgotten contemporaries. They are two of the unluckiest–and yet\nluckiest–authors who ever tried to sell a manuscript along\nBroadway. One of them is Edgar Allan Poe and the other is Walt\nWhitman. They shall have a chapter to themselves.",
        "But before turning to that chapter, we must look back to New\nEngland once more and observe the blossoming-time of its ancient\ncommonwealths. During the thirty years preceding the Civil War\nNew England awoke to a new life of the spirit. So varied and rich\nwas her literary productiveness in this era that it still remains\nher greatest period, and so completely did New England writers of\nthis epoch voice the ideals of the nation that the great majority\nof Americans, even today, regard these New Englanders as the\ntruest literary exponents of the mind and soul of the United\nStates. We must take a look at them.",
