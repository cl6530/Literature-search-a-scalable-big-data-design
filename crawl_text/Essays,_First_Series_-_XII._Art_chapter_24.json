        "Because the soul is progressive, it never quite\nrepeats itself, but in every act attempts the\nproduction of a new and fairer whole.  This appears\nin works both of the useful and the fine arts, if\nwe employ the popular distinction of works according\nto their aim either at use or beauty. Thus in our\nfine arts, not imitation but creation is the aim. In\nlandscapes the painter should give the suggestion of\na fairer creation than we know. The details, the prose\nof nature he should omit and give us only the spirit\nand splendor.  He should know that the landscape has\nbeauty for his eye because it expresses a thought\nwhich is to him good; and this because the same power\nwhich sees through his eyes is seen in that spectacle;\nand he will come to value the expression of nature and\nnot nature itself, and so exalt in his copy the features\nthat please him. He will give the gloom of gloom and the\nsunshine of sunshine. In a portrait he must inscribe the\ncharacter and not the features, and must esteem the man\nwho sits to him as himself only an imperfect picture or\nlikeness of the aspiring original within.",
        "What is that abridgment and selection we observe\nin all spiritual activity, but itself the creative\nimpulse? for it is the inlet of that higher\nillumination which teaches to convey a larger sense\nby simpler symbols. What is a man but nature’s finer\nsuccess in self-explication? What is a man but a finer\nand compacter landscape than the horizon figures,—\nnature’s eclecticism? and what is his speech, his love\nof painting, love of nature, but a still finer success,\n—all the weary miles and tons of space and bulk left\nout, and the spirit or moral of it contracted into a\nmusical word, or the most cunning stroke of the pencil?",
        "But the artist must employ the symbols in use in\nhis day and nation to convey his enlarged sense to\nhis fellow-men. Thus the new in art is always formed\nout of the old. The Genius of the Hour sets his\nineffaceable seal on the work and gives it an\ninexpressible charm for the imagination. As far as\nthe spiritual character of the period overpowers the\nartist and finds expression in his work, so far it\nwill retain a certain grandeur, and will represent\nto future beholders the Unknown, the Inevitable, the\nDivine. No man can quite exclude this element of\nNecessity from his labor. No man can quite emancipate\nhimself from his age and country, or produce a model\nin which the education, the religion, the politics,\nusages and arts of his times shall have no share.\nThough he were never so original, never so wilful\nand fantastic, he cannot wipe out of his work every\ntrace of the thoughts amidst which it grew. The very\navoidance betrays the usage he avoids. Above his will\nand out of his sight he is necessitated by the air he\nbreathes and the idea on which he and his contemporaries\nlive and toil, to share the manner of his times, without\nknowing what that manner is. Now that which is inevitable\nin the work has a higher charm than individual talent can\never give, inasmuch as the artist’s pen or chisel seems\nto have been held and guided by a gigantic hand to inscribe\na line in the history of the human race. This circumstance\ngives a value to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, to the Indian,\nChinese and Mexican idols, however gross and shapeless.\nThey denote the height of the human soul in that hour,\nand were not fantastic, but sprung from a necessity as\ndeep as the world. Shall I now add that the whole extant\nproduct of the plastic arts has herein its highest value,\nas history; as a stroke drawn in the portrait of that fate,\nperfect and beautiful, according to whose ordinations all\nbeings advance to their beatitude?",
        "Thus, historically viewed, it has been the office\nof art to educate the perception of beauty. We are\nimmersed in beauty, but our eyes have no clear vision.\nIt needs, by the exhibition of single traits, to assist\nand lead the dormant taste. We carve and paint, or we\nbehold what is carved and painted, as students of the\nmystery of Form. The virtue of art lies in detachment,\nin sequestering one object from the embarrassing variety.\nUntil one thing comes out from the connection of things,\nthere can be enjoyment, contemplation, but no thought.\nOur happiness and unhappiness are unproductive. The\ninfant lies in a pleasing trance, but his individual\ncharacter and his practical power depend on his daily\nprogress in the separation of things, and dealing with\none at a time. Love and all the passions concentrate\nall existence around a single form. It is the habit of\ncertain minds to give an all-excluding fulness to the\nobject, the thought, the word, they alight upon, and\nto make that for the time the deputy of the world.\nThese are the artists, the orators, the leaders of\nsociety. The power to detach and to magnify by detaching\nis the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and\nthe poet. This rhetoric, or power to fix the momentary\neminency of an object,—so remarkable in Burke, in Byron,\nin Carlyle,—the painter and sculptor exhibit in color\nand in stone. The power depends on the depth of the\nartist’s insight of that object he contemplates. For\nevery object has its roots in central nature, and may of\ncourse be so exhibited to us as to represent the world.\nTherefore each work of genius is the tyrant of the hour\nAnd concentrates attention on itself. For the time, it\nis the only thing worth naming to do that,—be it a\nsonnet, an opera, a landscape, a statue, an oration,\nthe plan of a temple, of a campaign, or of a voyage of\ndiscovery. Presently we pass to some other object, which\nrounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example\na well-laid garden; and nothing seems worth doing but the\nlaying out of gardens. I should think fire the best thing\nin the world, if I were not acquainted with air, and water,\nand earth. For it is the right and property of all natural\nobjects, of all genuine talents, of all native properties\nwhatsoever, to be for their moment the top of the world.\nA squirrel leaping from bough to bough and making the\nWood but one wide tree for his pleasure, fills the eye\nnot less than a lion,—is beautiful, self-sufficing, and\nstands then and there for nature. A good ballad draws my\near and heart whilst I listen, as much as an epic has\ndone before. A dog, drawn by a master, or a litter of\npigs, satisfies and is a reality not less than the\nfrescoes of Angelo. From this succession of excellent\nobjects we learn at last the immensity of the world,\nthe opulence of human nature, which can run out to\ninfinitude in any direction. But I also learn that what\nastonished and fascinated me in the first work astonished\nme in the second work also; that excellence of all things\nis one.",
        "The office of painting and sculpture seems to be\nmerely initial. The best pictures can easily tell\nus their last secret.  The best pictures are rude\ndraughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines\nand dyes which make up the ever-changing “landscape\nwith figures” amidst which we dwell. Painting seems\nto be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs. When\nthat has educated the frame to self-possession, to\nnimbleness, to grace, the steps of the dancing-master\nare better forgotten; so painting teaches me the\nsplendor of color and the expression of form, and as\nI see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I\nsee the boundless opulence of the pencil, the\nindifferency in which the artist stands free to choose\nout of the possible forms. If he can draw every thing,\nwhy draw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the\neternal picture which nature paints in the street, with\nmoving men and children, beggars and fine ladies, draped\nin red and green and blue and gray; long-haired, grizzled,\nwhite-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf, expanded,\nelfish,—capped and based by heaven, earth and sea.",
        "A gallery of sculpture teaches more austerely the\nsame lesson.  As picture teaches the coloring, so\nsculpture the anatomy of form.  When I have seen\nfine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly,\nI understand well what he meant who said, “When I\nhave been reading Homer, all men look like giants.\"\nI too see that painting and sculpture are gymnastics\nof the eye, its training to the niceties and curiosities\nof its function. There is no statue like this living\nman, with his infinite advantage over all ideal sculpture,\nof perpetual variety. What a gallery of art have I here!\nNo mannerist made these varied groups and diverse original\nsingle figures. Here is the artist himself improvising,\ngrim and glad, at his block. Now one thought strikes him,\nnow another, and with each moment he alters the whole air,\nattitude and expression of his clay. Away with your\nnonsense of oil and easels, of marble and chisels; except\nto open your eyes to the masteries of eternal art, they\nare hypocritical rubbish.",
        "The reference of all production at last to an\naboriginal Power explains the traits common to all\nworks of the highest art,—that they are universally\nintelligible; that they restore to us the simplest\nstates of mind, and are religious. Since what skill\nis therein shown is the reappearance of the original\nsoul, a jet of pure light, it should produce a similar\nimpression to that made by natural objects. In happy\nhours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected,\n—the work of genius. And the individual, in whom simple\ntastes and susceptibility to all the great human\ninfluences overpower the accidents of a local and special\nculture, is the best critic of art. Though we travel the\nworld over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with\nus, or we find it not. The best of beauty is a finer\ncharm than skill in surfaces, in outlines, or rules of\nart can ever teach, namely a radiation from the work of\nart of human character,—a wonderful expression through\nstone, or canvas, or musical sound, of the deepest and\nsimplest attributes of our nature, and therefore most\nintelligible at last to those souls which have these\nattributes.  In the sculptures of the Greeks, in the\nmasonry of the Romans, and in the pictures of the Tuscan\nand Venetian masters, the highest charm is the universal\nlanguage they speak. A confession of moral nature, of\npurity, love, and hope, breathes from them all. That\nwhich we carry to them, the same we bring back more\nfairly illustrated in the memory. The traveller who\nvisits the Vatican, and passes from chamber to chamber\nthrough galleries of statues, vases, sarcophagi and\ncandelabra, through all forms of beauty cut in the\nrichest materials, is in danger of forgetting the\nsimplicity of the principles out of which they all\nsprung, and that they had their origin from thoughts\nand laws in his own breast. He studies the technical\nrules on these wonderful remains, but forgets that\nthese works were not always thus constellated; that\nthey are the contributions of many ages and many\ncountries; that each came out of the solitary workshop\nof one artist, who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the\nexistence of other sculpture, created his work without\nother model save life, household life, and the sweet\nand smart of personal relations, of beating hearts, and\nmeeting eyes; of poverty and necessity and hope and fear.\nThese were his inspirations, and these are the effects\nhe carries home to your heart and mind. In proportion to\nhis force, the artist will find in his work an outlet for\nhis proper character. He must not be in any manner pinched\nor hindered by his material, but through his necessity\nof imparting himself the adamant will be wax in his hands,\nand will allow an adequate communication of himself, in\nhis full stature and proportion. He need not cumber himself\nwith a conventional nature and culture, nor ask what is the\nmode in Rome or in Paris, but that house and weather and\nmanner of living which poverty and the fate of birth have\nmade at once so odious and so dear, in the gray unpainted\nwood cabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in\nthe log-hut of the backwoods, or in the narrow lodging\nwhere he has endured the constraints and seeming of a city\npoverty, will serve as well as any other condition as the\nsymbol of a thought which pours itself indifferently\nthrough all.",
        "I remember when in my younger days I had heard of\nthe wonders of Italian painting, I fancied the great\npictures would be great strangers; some surprising\ncombination of color and form; a foreign wonder,\nbarbaric pearl and gold, like the spontoons and\nstandards of the militia, which play such pranks in\nthe eyes and imaginations of school-boys. I was to\nsee and acquire I knew not what. When I came at last\nto Rome and saw with eyes the pictures, I found that\ngenius left to novices the gay and fantastic and\nostentatious, and itself pierced directly to the\nsimple and true; that it was familiar and sincere;\nthat it was the old, eternal fact I had met already\nin so many forms,—unto which I lived; that it was\nthe plain you and me I knew so well,—had left at home\nin so many conversations. I had the same experience\nalready in a church at Naples. There I saw that nothing\nwas changed with me but the place, and said to myself—\n’Thou foolish child, hast thou come out hither, over\nfour thousand miles of salt water, to find that which\nwas perfect to thee there at home?’  That fact I saw\nagain in the Academmia at Naples, in the chambers of\nsculpture, and yet again when I came to Rome and to\nthe paintings of Raphael, Angelo, Sacchi, Titian, and\nLeonardo da Vinci. “What, old mole! workest thou in\nthe earth so fast?” It had travelled by my side; that\nwhich I fancied I had left in Boston was here in the\nVatican, and again at Milan and at Paris, and made all\ntravelling ridiculous as a treadmill. I now require\nthis of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not\nthat they dazzle me. Pictures must not be too picturesque.\nNothing astonishes men so much as common-sense and\nplain dealing. All great actions have been simple, and\nall great pictures are.",
        "The Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent\nexample of this peculiar merit. A calm benignant\nbeauty shines over all this picture, and goes\ndirectly to the heart. It seems almost to call\nyou by name. The sweet and sublime face of Jesus\nis beyond praise, yet how it disappoints all florid\nexpectations! This familiar, simple, home-speaking\ncountenance is as if one should meet a friend. The\nknowledge of picture-dealers has its value, but\nlisten not to their criticism when your heart is\ntouched by genius. It was not painted for them, it\nwas painted for you; for such as had eyes capable\nof being touched by simplicity and lofty emotions.",
        "Yet when we have said all our fine things about\nthe arts, we must end with a frank confession, that\nthe arts, as we know them, are but initial. Our best\npraise is given to what they aimed and promised, not\nto the actual result. He has conceived meanly of the\nresources of man, who believes that the best age of\nproduction is past. The real value of the Iliad or\nthe Transfiguration is as signs of power; billows or\nripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens of\nthe everlasting effort to produce, which even in its\nworst estate the soul betrays. Art has not yet come\nto its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with\nthe most potent influences of the world, if it is not\npractical and moral, if it do not stand in connection\nwith the conscience, if it do not make the poor and\nuncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice\nof lofty cheer. There is higher work for Art than the\narts. They are abortive births of an imperfect or\nvitiated instinct. Art is the need to create; but in\nits essence, immense and universal, it is impatient of\nworking with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples\nand monsters, such as all pictures and statues are.\nNothing less than the creation of man and nature is its\nend. A man should find in it an outlet for his whole\nenergy. He may paint and carve only as long as he can\ndo that. Art should exhilarate, and throw down the\nwalls of circumstance on every side, awakening in the\nbeholder the same sense of universal relation and power\nwhich the work evinced in the artist, and its highest\neffect is to make new artists.",
        "Already History is old enough to witness the old\nage and disappearance of particular arts. The art\nof sculpture is long ago perished to any real effect.\nIt was originally a useful art, a mode of writing, a\nsavage’s record of gratitude or devotion, and among\na people possessed of a wonderful perception of form\nthis childish carving was refined to the utmost\nsplendor of effect. But it is the game of a rude and\nyouthful people, and not the manly labor of a wise\nand spiritual nation. Under an oak-tree loaded with\nleaves and nuts, under a sky full of eternal eyes, I\nstand in a thoroughfare; but in the works of our\nplastic arts and especially of sculpture, creation\nis driven into a corner. I cannot hide from myself\nthat there is a certain appearance of paltriness, as\nof toys and the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture.\nNature transcends all our moods of thought, and its\nsecret we do not yet find. But the gallery stands at\nthe mercy of our moods, and there is a moment when\nit becomes frivolous.  I do not wonder that Newton,\nwith an attention habitually engaged on the paths of\nplanets and suns, should have wondered what the Earl\nof Pembroke found to admire in “stone dolls.” Sculpture\nmay serve to teach the pupil how deep is the secret of\nform, how purely the spirit can translate its meanings\ninto that eloquent dialect. But the statue will look\ncold and false before that new activity which needs\nto roll through all things, and is impatient of\ncounterfeits and things not alive. Picture and sculpture\nare the celebrations and festivities of form. But true\nart is never fixed, but always flowing. The sweetest music\nis not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it\nspeaks from its instant life tones of tenderness, truth,\nor courage. The oratorio has already lost its relation to\nthe morning, to the sun, and the earth, but that persuading\nvoice is in tune with these. All works of art should not\nbe detached, but extempore performances. A great man is\na new statue in every attitude and action. A beautiful\nwoman is a picture which drives all beholders nobly mad.\nLife may be lyric or epic, as well as a poem or a romance.",
        "A true announcement of the law of creation, if a\nman were found worthy to declare it, would carry\nart up into the kingdom of nature, and destroy its\nseparate and contrasted existence. The fountains\nof invention and beauty in modern society are all\nbut dried up. A popular novel, a theatre, or a\nball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers in\nthe alms-house of this world, without dignity,\nwithout skill or industry. Art is as poor and low.\nThe old tragic Necessity, which lowers on the brows\neven of the Venuses and the Cupids of the antique,\nand furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of\nsuch anomalous figures into nature,—namely, that\nthey were inevitable; that the artist was drunk with\na passion for form which he could not resist, and\nwhich vented itself in these fine extravagances,—no\nlonger dignifies the chisel or the pencil. But the\nartist and the connoisseur now seek in art the\nexhibition of their talent, or an asylum from the\nevils of life. Men are not well pleased with the\nfigure they make in their own imaginations, and they\nflee to art, and convey their better sense in an\noratorio, a statue, or a picture. Art makes the same\neffort which a sensual prosperity makes; namely to\ndetach the beautiful from the useful, to do up the\nwork as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on to\nenjoyment. These solaces and compensations, this\ndivision of beauty from use, the laws of nature do\nnot permit. As soon as beauty is sought, not from\nreligion and love but for pleasure, it degrades the\nseeker. High beauty is no longer attainable by him in\ncanvas or in stone, in sound, or in lyrical construction;\nan effeminate, prudent, sickly beauty, which is not\nbeauty, is all that can be formed; for the hand can\nnever execute any thing higher than the character can\ninspire.",
        "The art that thus separates is itself first separated.\nArt must not be a superficial talent, but must begin\nfarther back in man.  Now men do not see nature to be\nbeautiful, and they go to make a statue which shall\nbe. They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible,\nand console themselves with color-bags and blocks of\nmarble. They reject life as prosaic, and create a death\nwhich they call poetic. They despatch the day’s weary\nchores, and fly to voluptuous reveries. They eat and\ndrink, that they may afterwards execute the ideal. Thus\nis art vilified; the name conveys to the mind its\nsecondary and bad senses; it stands in the imagination\nas somewhat contrary to nature, and struck with death\nfrom the first.  Would it not be better to begin higher\nup,—to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to\nserve the ideal in eating and drinking, in drawing the\nbreath, and in the functions of life? Beauty must come\nback to the useful arts, and the distinction between\nthe fine and the useful arts be forgotten. If history\nwere truly told, if life were nobly spent, it would be\nno longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from\nthe other. In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful.\nIt is therefore beautiful because it is alive, moving,\nreproductive; it is therefore useful because it is\nsymmetrical and fair. Beauty will not come at the call\nof a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or\nAmerica its history in Greece. It will come, as always,\nunannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave\nand earnest men. It is in vain that we look for genius\nto reiterate its miracles in the old arts; it is its\ninstinct to find beauty and holiness in new and necessary\nfacts, in the field and road-side, in the shop and mill.\nProceeding from a religious heart it will raise to a\ndivine use the railroad, the insurance office, the joint-\nstock company; our law, our primary assemblies, our\ncommerce, the galvanic battery, the electric jar, the\nprism, and the chemist’s retort; in which we seek now\nonly an economical use. Is not the selfish and even cruel\naspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to\nmills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary\nimpulses which these works obey? When its errands are noble\nand adequate, a steamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old\nand New England and arriving at its ports with the\npunctuality of a planet, is a step of man into harmony with\nnature. The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies along the\nLena by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime. When\nscience is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by\nlove, they will appear the supplements and continuations\nof the material creation.",
