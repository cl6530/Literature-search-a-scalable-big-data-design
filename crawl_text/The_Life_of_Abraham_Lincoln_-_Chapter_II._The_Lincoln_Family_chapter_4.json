        "When one becomes interested in a boy, one is almost certain to ask,\nWhose son is he? And when we study the character of a great man, it is\nnatural and right that we should be interested in his family. Where did\nhe come from? who were his parents? where did they come from? These\nquestions will engage our attention in this chapter.",
        "But it is well to be on our guard at the outset against the\nfascinations of any theory of heredity. Every thoughtful observer knows\nsomething of the seductions of this subject either from experience or\nfrom observation. In every subject of research there is danger of\nclaiming too much in order to magnify the theory. This is emphatically\ntrue of this theory. Its devotees note the hits but not the misses. “It\ntook five generations of cultured clergymen to produce an Emerson.\"\nUndoubtedly; but what of the sixth and seventh generations? “Darwin’s\ngreatness came from his father and grandfather.” Very true; but are\nthere no more Darwins?",
        "If Abraham Lincoln got his remarkable character from parents or\ngrandparents, from whom did he get his physical stature? His father was\na little above medium height, being five feet ten and one-half inches.\nHis mother was a little less than medium height, being five feet five\ninches. Their son was a giant, being no less than six feet four inches.\nIt is not safe to account too closely for his physical, mental, or\nmoral greatness by his descent. The fact is that there are too many\nunexplored remainders in the factors of heredity to make it possible to\napply the laws definitely.",
        "The writer will therefore give a brief account of the Lincoln family\nsimply as a matter of interest, and not as a means of proving or\nexplaining any natural law.",
        "The future president was descended from people of the middle class.\nThere was nothing either in his family or his surroundings to attract\nthe attention even of the closest observer, or to indicate any material\ndifference between him and scores of other boys in the same general\nlocality.",
        "Lincoln is an old English name, and in 1638 a family of the name\nsettled in Hingham, Mass., near Boston. Many years later we find the\nancestors of the president living in Berks County, Pa. It is possible\nthat this family came direct from England; but it is probable that they\ncame from Hingham. Both in Hingham and in Berks County there is a\nfrequent recurrence of certain scriptural names, such as Abraham,\nMordecai, and Thomas, which seems to be more than a coincidence.",
        "From Berks County certain of the family, who, by the way, were Quakers,\nmoved to Rockingham County, Va. In 1769 Daniel Boone, the adventurous\npioneer, opened up what is now the state of Kentucky, but was then a\npart of Virginia.",
        "About twelve years later, in 1781, Abraham Lincoln, great-grandfather\nof the president, emigrated from Virginia into Kentucky. People have\nasked, in a puzzled manner, why did he leave the beautiful Shenandoah\nvalley? One answer may be given: The Ohio valley also is beautiful.\nDuring the major portion of the year, from the budding of the leaves in\nApril until they pass away in the blaze of their autumn glory, the\nentire region is simply bewitching. No hills curve more gracefully, no\natmosphere is more soft, no watercourses are more enticing. Into this\nregion came the Virginian family, consisting, besides the parents, of\nthree sons and two daughters.",
        "A year or two later the head of the family was murdered by a skulking\nIndian, who proceeded to kidnap the youngest son, Thomas. The oldest\nson, Mordecai, quickly obtained a gun and killed the Indian, thus\navenging his father and rescuing his little brother.",
        "This boy Thomas was father of the president. He has been called by some\nwriters shiftless and densely ignorant. But he seems to have been more\na creature of circumstances. There were no schools, and he,\nconsequently, did not go to school. There was no steady employment, and\nconsequently he had no steady employment. It is difficult to see how he\ncould have done better. He could shoot and keep the family supplied\nwith wild game. He did odd jobs as opportunity opened and “just\ngrowed.”",
        "But he had force enough to learn to read and write after his marriage.\nHe had the roving disposition which is, and always has been, a trait of\npioneers. But this must be interpreted by the fact that he was\noptimistic rather than pessimistic. He removed to Indiana because, to\nhim, Indiana was the most glorious place in the whole world. He later\nremoved to Illinois because that was more glorious yet.",
        "He certainly showed good taste in the selection of his wives, and what\nis equally to the purpose, was able to persuade them to share his\nhumble lot. He had an unfailing stock of good nature, was expert in\ntelling a humorous story, was perfectly at home in the woods, a fair\ncarpenter and a good farmer; and in short was as agreeable a companion\nas one would find in a day’s journey. He would not have been at home in\na library, but he was at home in the forest.",
        "In 1806 he married Nancy Hanks, a young woman from Virginia, who became\nthe mother of the president. Doubtless there are many women among the\nobscure who are as true and loyal as she was, but whose life is not\nbrought into publicity. Still, without either comparing or contrasting\nher with others, we may attest our admiration of this one as a “woman\nnobly planned.” In the midst of her household cares, which were neither\nfew nor light, she had the courage to undertake to teach her husband to\nread and write. She also gave her children a start in learning. Of her\nthe president, nearly half a century after her death, said to Seward,\nwith tears,–\"All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother–\nblessings on her memory.”",
        "Mr. Lincoln himself never manifested much interest in his genealogy. At\none time he did give out a brief statement concerning his ancestors\nbecause it seemed to be demanded by the exegencies of the campaign. But\nat another time, when questioned by Mr. J. L. Scripps, editor of the\nChicago Tribune, he answered: “Why, Scripps, it is a great piece of\nfolly to attempt to make anything out of me or my early life. It can\nall be condensed into a single sentence, and that sentence you will\nfind in Gray’s Elegy:",
        "That’s my life, and that’s all you or any one else can make out of it.”",
        "In all this he was neither proud nor depreciative of his people. He was\nsimply modest. Nor did he ever outgrow his sympathy with the common\npeople.",
