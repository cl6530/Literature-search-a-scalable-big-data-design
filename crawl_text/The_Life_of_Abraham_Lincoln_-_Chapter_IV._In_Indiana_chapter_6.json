        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "The death of his wife had left Thomas Lincoln with the care of three\nyoung children: namely, Sarah, about eleven years old, Abe, ten years\nold, and the foster brother, Dennis (Friend) Hanks, a year or two\nyounger. The father was not able to do woman’s work as well as his wife\nhad been able to do man’s work, and the condition of the home was\npitiable indeed. To the three motherless children and the bereaved\nfather it was a long and dreary winter. When spring came they had the\nbenefits of life in the woods and fields, and so lived through the\nseason until the edge of the following winter. It is not to be wondered\nat that the father was unwilling to repeat the loneliness of the\npreceding year.",
        "Early in December, 1819, he returned to Elizabethtown, Ky., and\nproposed marriage to a widow, Mrs. Sally Bush Johnston. The proposal\nmust have been direct, with few preliminaries or none, for the couple\nwere married next morning. The new wife brought him a fortune, in\naddition to three children of various ages, of sundry articles of\nhousehold furniture. Parents, children, and goods were shortly after\nloaded into a wagon drawn by a four-horse team, and in all the style of\nthis frontier four-in-hand, were driven over indescribable roads,\nthrough woods and fields, to their Indiana home.",
        "The accession of Sally Bush’s furniture made an important improvement\nin the home. What was more important, she had her husband finish the\nlog cabin by providing window, door, and floor. What was most important\nof all, she brought the sweet spirit of an almost ideal motherhood into\nthe home, giving to all the children alike a generous portion of\nmother-love.",
        "The children now numbered six, and not only were they company for one\nanother, but the craving for womanly affection, which is the most\npersistent hunger of the heart of child or man, was beautifully met.\nShe did not humor them to the point of idleness, but wisely ruled with\nstrictness without imperiousness. She kept them from bad habits and\nretained their affection to the last. The influence upon the growing\nlad of two such women as Nancy Hanks and Sally Bush was worth more than\nthat of the best appointed college in all the land.",
        "The boy grew into youth, and he grew very fast. While still in his\nteens he reached the full stature of his manhood, six feet and four\ninches. His strength was astonishing, and many stories were told of\nthis and subsequent periods to illustrate his physical prowess, such\nas: he once lifted up a hencoop weighing six hundred pounds and carried\nit off bodily; he could lift a full barrel of cider to his mouth and\ndrink from the bung-hole; he could sink an ax-halve deeper into a log\nthan any man in the country.",
        "During the period of his growth into youth he spent much of his time in\nreading, talking, and, after a fashion, making speeches. He also wrote\nsome. His political writings won great admiration from his neighbors.\nHe occasionally wrote satires which, while not refined, were very\nstinging. This would not be worth mentioning were it not for the fact\nthat it shows that from boyhood he knew the force of this formidable\nweapon which later he used with so much skill. The country store\nfurnished the frontier substitute for the club, and there the men were\nwont to congregate. It is needless to say that young Lincoln was the\nlife of the gatherings, being an expert in the telling of a humorous\nstory and having always a plentiful supply. His speech-making proved so\nattractive that his father was forced to forbid him to practise it\nduring working hours because the men would always leave their work to\nlisten to him.",
        "During these years he had no regular employment, but did odd jobs\nwherever he got a chance. At one time, for example, he worked on a\nferryboat for the munificent wages of thirty-seven and one half cents a\nday.",
        "When sixteen years old, Lincoln had his first lesson in oratory. He\nattended court at Boonville, county seat of Warwick County and heard a\ncase in which one of the aristocratic Breckenridges of Kentucky was\nattorney for the defense. The power of his oratory was a revelation to\nthe lad. At its conclusion the awkward, ill-dressed, bashful but\nenthusiastic young Lincoln pressed forward to offer his congratulations\nand thanks to the eloquent lawyer, who haughtily brushed by him without\naccepting the proffered hand. In later years the men met again, this\ntime in Washington City, in the white house. The president reminded\nBreckenridge of the incident which the latter had no desire to recall.",
        "When about nineteen years old, he made his first voyage down the Ohio\nand Mississippi rivers. Two incidents are worth recording of this trip.\nThe purpose was to find, in New Orleans, a market for produce, which\nwas simply floated down stream on a flat-boat. There was, of course, a\nrow-boat for tender. The crew consisted of himself and young Gentry,\nson of his employer.",
        "Near Baton Rouge they had tied up for the night in accordance with the\ncustom of flat-boat navigation. During the night they were awakened by\na gang of seven ruffian negroes who had come aboard to loot the stuff.\nLincoln shouted “Who’s there?” Receiving no reply he seized a handspike\nand knocked over the first, second, third, and fourth in turn, when the\nremaining three took to the woods. The two northerners pursued them a\nshort distance, then returned, loosed their craft and floated safely to\ntheir destination.",
        "It was on this trip that Lincoln earned his first dollar, as he in\nafter years related to William H. Seward:",
        "”... A steamer was going down the river. We have, you know, no wharves\non the western streams, and the custom was, if passengers were at any\nof the landings, they were to go out in a boat, the steamer stopping\nand taking them on board.... Two men with trunks came down to the shore\nin carriages, and looking at the different boats, singled out mine, and\nasked, ’Who owns this?’ I modestly answered, ’I do.’ ’Will you take us\nand our trunks out to the steamer?’ ’Certainly.’... The trunks were put\nin my boat, the passengers seated themselves on them, and I sculled\nthem out to the steamer. They got on board, and I lifted the trunks and\nput them on the deck. The steamer was about to put on steam again, when\nI called out: ’You have forgotten to pay me.’ Each of them took from\nhis pocket a silver half dollar and threw it on the bottom of my boat.\nI could scarcely believe my eyes as I picked up the money. You may\nthink it was a very little thing, and in these days it seems to me like\na trifle, but it was a most important incident in my life. I could\nscarcely credit that I, a poor boy, had earned a dollar in less than a\nday; that by honest work I had earned a dollar. I was a more hopeful\nand thoughtful boy from that time.”",
        "The goods were sold profitably at New Orleans and the return trip was\nmade by steamboat. This was about twenty years after Fulton’s first\nvoyage from New York to Albany, which required seven days. Steamboats\nhad been put on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, but these crafts were\nof primitive construction–awkward as to shape and slow as to speed.\nThe frequency of boiler explosions was proverbial for many years. The\nlads, Gentry and Lincoln, returned home duly and the employer was well\nsatisfied with the results of the expedition.",
        "In 1830 the epidemic “milk sick” reappeared in Indiana, and Thomas\nLincoln had a pardonable desire to get out of the country. Illinois was\nat that time settling up rapidly and there were glowing accounts of its\ndesirableness. Thomas Lincoln’s decision to move on to the new land of\npromise was reasonable. He sold out and started with his family and\nhousehold goods to his new destination. The time of year was March,\njust when the frost is coming out of the ground so that the mud is\napparently bottomless. The author will not attempt to describe it, for\nhe has in boyhood seen it many times and knows it to be indescribable.\nIt was Abe’s duty to drive the four yoke of oxen, a task which must\nhave strained even his patience.",
        "They settled in Macon County, near Decatur. There the son faithfully\nworked with his father until the family was fairly settled, then\nstarted out in life for himself. For he had now reached the age of\ntwenty-one. As he had passed through the periods of childhood and\nyouth, and was on the threshold of manhood, it is right and fitting to\nreceive at this point the testimony of Sally Bush, his stepmother:",
        "“Abe was a good boy, and I can say what scarcely one woman–a mother–\ncan say in a thousand: Abe never gave me a cross word or look, and\nnever refused, in fact or appearance, to do anything I requested him. I\nnever gave him a cross word in all my life.... He was a dutiful son to\nme always. I think he loved me truly. I had a son John who was raised\nwith Abe. Both were good boys; but I must say, both being now dead,\nthat Abe was the best boy I ever saw, or expect to see.”",
        "These words of praise redound to the honor of the speaker equally with\nthat of her illustrious stepson.",
        "Lincoln came into the estate of manhood morally clean. He had formed no\nhabits that would cause years of struggle to overcome, he had committed\nno deed that would bring the blush of shame to his cheek, he was as\nfree from vice as from crime. He was not profane, he had never tasted\nliquor, he was no brawler, he never gambled, he was honest and\ntruthful. On the other hand, he had a genius for making friends, he was\nthe center of every social circle, he was a good talker and a close\nreasoner. Without a thought of the great responsibilities awaiting him,\nhe had thus far fitted himself well by his faithfulness in such duties\nas fell to him.",
