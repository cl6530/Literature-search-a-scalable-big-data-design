        "Bivouac, near Santiago, Cuba,\nJuly 23, 1898.\nThe Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.",
        "Sir,–In compliance with orders I have the honor to submit the\nfollowing report of my command, the Gatling Gun Detachment, 5th Army\nCorps, covering its operations down to the present date:",
        "1. Organization.–Pursuant to instructions from Gen. Shafter I was\ngiven a detail of two sergeants and ten men on the 26th of May, 1898,\nfrom the 13th Infantry, then in camp near Tampa, Fla., and directed to\nreport to 1st Lieut. John T. Thompson, O. D., ordinance officer,\nTampa, “for duty with Gatling guns.” I was placed in charge of four\nguns, model 1895, cal. 30, and at once began the instruction of the\ndetachment. On June 1st I received verbal instruction to assist Lieut.\nThompson in his work at the ordinance depot, and performed this duty\nin addition to my duties with the guns until June 6, 1898,\nsuperintending issues to the expedition (5th Corps) then fitting out\nfor Cuba.",
        "On June 6th I took my men and guns aboard the transport Cherokee, and\non June 11th, per special orders No. 16 of that date, my detail was\nincreased to thirty-seven men, all told, of whom one was left sick in\nhospital at Tampa. About twelve of these did not join me, however,\nuntil after debarkation at Baiquiri, Cuba. On June 25th I received\nverbal instructions from Gen. Shafter to disembark at once, select the\nnecessary number of mules (two per gun), and get to the front as soon\nas possible, reporting on my arrival there to Gen. Wheeler, then in\ncommand of all the troops at the front. I was unable to obtain any\ntentage for myself, and had only shelter-tents for my men.",
        "I was joined on June 25th by Capt. Henry Marcotte, 17th Infantry,\nretired, regularly authorized correspondent of the Army and Navy\nJournal, who has been with me ever since, enduring all the\nvicissitudes of the season with Spartan fortitude, although equally\ndestitute of cover as myself and 60 years of age. I desire to express\nhere officially and fully, my sincere gratitude for the kindness which\npermitted him to accompany my command, and the great appreciation of\nthe valuable advice and assistance which he has given continually. His\nlarge experience of war, his clear head and good judgment have always\nbeen at hand to aid, and his cool example to myself and my men under\nfire did much to steady us and keep us up to our work when we were\nfirst called on to face that ordeal.",
        "All of the detachments, who had not previously joined me, did so on\nJune 26th, on which day I reached the extreme front and reported to\nGen. Wheeler. The guns were posted in a position to sweep the\nneighboring hills toward the enemy, and I went into camp, remaining\nthere until the morning of July 1st.",
        "Summing up the organization, it should be stated here that the\ndetachment was organized at the first, and has ever since remained an\nindependent command, receiving its orders directly from the corps\ncommander. It has had its own records, returns, rolls, etc., and has\nbeen rationed separately all the time, and is composed of men selected\nby myself from various regiments.",
        "2. The Battery in Action.–On the morning of July 1st, I broke camp at\n4:30 a.m., and pursuant to instructions from Gen. Shafter, proceeded\nto El Poso, placing my battery, as I shall henceforth call it, in\nsupport behind the position taken by a battery of artillery. I took\nthis position about 6 a.m., and soon after the artillery arrived, went\non to battery and opened fire at Santiago, the range being 2,600\nyards. After some time the enemy replied with a well-directed fire,\nthe second shell bursting directly over my battery in rear of\nartillery. Neither my men nor mules showed any signs of disturbance,\nand we remained in our perilous position nearly twenty minutes, the\nenemy’s shells bursting all around us, until ordered to the rear by\nthe chief-of-staff. The battery went to the rear under fire quietly\nuntil out of range, and remained there until the artillery fire\nceased, at about 9 a.m. Private Hoft, Company D, 13th Infantry, a\nmember of the detachment who had been detailed to guard the camp\nequipage at El Poso, remained at his post during the whole of the\nartillery fight, and deserves great credit therefor, his battery\nhaving been ordered to the rear. At 9 a.m. I returned to El Poso, and\nthere received the following instructions from Col. McClernand, A. A.\nG., 5th Corps: “Find the 71st N. Y. V. and go on with them, if you\ncan. If this is not practical, find the best position you can, and use\nyour guns to the best advantage.” Pursuant to these instructions, I\nwent forward about a half-mile and found the 71st N. Y. V. halting to\nlearn what their instructions were. I could get no clear idea of what\nthey were going to do, but waited about fifteen minutes in their rear\nto find out. Meantime troops continually passed us toward the front.\nThen, about 10:15, firing began in front. I rode forward alone along\nthe rode, which was a narrow defile through the jungle, and found that\nabout a half-mile in front was a creek, upon the crossing of which the\nenemy’s fire seemed concentrated. In front of this crossing seemed to\nbe a level plain of about 400 to 800 yards, beyond which was a\nsemi-circular ridge crowned with Spanish trenches from which the\nSpanish fire seemed to come. Men were being hit continually at this\nplace (the ford), but it seemed to me to be a good place to work my\nbattery effectively.",
        "I rode back, finding the Seventy-first still lying beside the road\nwithout any apparent intention of moving. I determined to leave them\nand go into action. Taking a gallop I moved the battery forward nearly\nto the ford (about 150 yards), where I met Col. Derby of Gen.\nShafter’s staff, who informed me that the troops were not yet\nsufficiently deployed to take advantage of my fire, and advised me to\nwait. The bullets were cutting through all around, and, as we learned\nafterward, the enemy’s sharpshooters were actually in the woods near\nus, up in tall trees, picking off officers and men. It should be\nstated here that the sudden increase of the enemy’s fire at this time\nwas caused by a wild cheering set up by the 71st N. Y. V., as the\nbattery passed them on its way to the front. The cheering located our\nposition for the enemy and drew his fire. Many a brave soldier who had\ngone to the front was put forever beyond the possibility of cheering\nby this outburst of ignorant enthusiasm.",
        "I acted on Col. Derby’s advice, and he promised to send me word when\nthe moment for proper action came. This was necessary, as I knew only\npart of the plan of battle and might have jeopardized other parts of\nprematurely exposing our strength at this point. The gun crews lay\ndown under their guns and steadily remained at this posts. The fire\nfinally grew so hot that I moved about 100 yards back. This was about\n12, noon. At 1 p. m., or about that time, I received a message sent by\nCol. Derby, I think, as follows: “Gen. Shafter directs that you give\none of your guns to Lieut. Miley, take the others forward beyond the\nford where the dynamite gun is, and go into action at the best point\nyou can find.” I obeyed the order, giving Lieut. Miley Sergeant\nWeigle’s gun and crew and moving the rest forward at a gallop to the\npoint beyond the ford, which I had already selected as a good place.\nThe battery opened with three guns simultaneously at ranges of 600 to\n800 yards at 1:15 p. m. The enemy at first concentrated his fire upon\nus, but soon weakened and in five minutes was clambering from his\ntrenches and running to the rear. We fired as rapidly as possible upon\nthe groups thus presented until I saw a white handkerchief waved by\nsome one of my own regiment, the 13th Infantry, and at the same moment\nCapt. Landis, 1st Cavalry, who had voluntarily assisted me throughout,\nsaid: “Better stop; our own men are climbing up the ridge.” I ordered\nthe fire to cease at 1:23 1/2 p.m., and a moment later saw our own\ntroops occupy the crest of the hill. The firing had been, continued by\nthe battery until our own troops were within 150 yards of the enemy’s\ntrench, a fact made possible by the steep slope of the hill upon which\nthe enemy had been.",
        "At the time when my battery went into action I had no support, and the\nposition I took was at least 100 yards in front of any of our troops\nalong this part of the line. About the time I ceased firing\nLieut.-Col. Baldwin, 10th Cavalry, put two troops in support of my\nbattery.",
        "I have advanced in a letter to the Adjutant General from Fort\nLeavenworth, dated January 1st, 1898, the theory that such guns as\nthese can be used offensively. The conditions of this assault were\nfavorable, the morale of my men superb, and the use made of the guns\nfollowed the theory therein set forth with the exactness of a\nmathematical demonstration. The infantry and cavalry had been pounding\naway for two hours on these positions; in eight and one-half minutes\nafter the Gatlings opened the works were ours. Inspired by the\nfriendly rattle of the machine guns, our own troops rose to the\ncharge; while the enemy amazed by our sudden and tremendous increase\nof fire, first diverted his fire to my battery, and then, unable to\nwithstand the hail of bullets, augmented by the moral effect of our\nbattery fire and the charging line, broke madly from his safe trenches\nand was mercilessly cut by fire from these guns during his flight.",
        "I at once limbered up and took stock of my losses. One man was killed,\none badly wounded, one mule hit twice, but not much injured, and\nseveral men were missing.",
        "Suddenly the fire was resumed at the front. I moved my three pieces\nforward again at a gallop, and went into action on the skirmish line\non top of the captured position, with two pieces to the right and one\nto the left of the main road from El Poso to Santiago. I was compelled\nto make the skirmishers give way to the right and left in order to get\nroom for my guns on the firing-line, and to impress stragglers to\ncarry ammunition. Capt. Ayres, 10th Cavalry, gave me a detail of one\nsergeant and two privates, all of whom did fine service. It seemed to\nme that the enemy was trying to retake the position. About 4 to 4:14\np. m. I saw a body, apparently about 400, of the enemy to the right\nfront of my position, apparently in front of the position occupied by\nLieut.-Col. Roosevelt with the 1st Volunteer Cavalry. I turned a\nGatling gun on them, using 600-yard range, and they disappeared. Soon\nafter the firing sensibly slackened.",
        "In the rapid fire on this last body of the enemy I had overheated one\npiece, and it went temporarily out of action. I went over to Col.\nRoosevelt’s position, about a quarter of a mile to the right of a\nsalient, and reconnoitered. While there Sergeant Weigle reported to me\nwith his piece, informing me that Lieut. Miley had not put it into\naction, and asked for instructions. This was about the hour of 5 p.\nm., and the fire became warmer at that moment. I directed Sergeant\nWeigle to run his piece up on the firing-line and to report to the\nofficer in charge thereof. He did so and went into action at once.\nCol. Roosevelt, who was and remained present, informs me that the gun\nwas very effectively used. I rejoined my other two guns and put both\nof them on the line at the left of the El Poso road. At sundown the\nenemy made a sharp attack, and all three of my guns were effectively\nused. During the fight a battery in the city opened on my two guns,\nfiring 16 cm. shells. I at once turned my guns on it and kept up so\nwarm a fire that the cannoneers left their battery and did not return.\nIn all they had fired three shells at us, all of which broke just over\nor beyond the battery. I secured the fuse of one, still warm, and\nafter the surrender visited the battery which had fired at us and\nexamined the gun. It is a 16 cm. (6.2992 inches) bronze rifle gun in\nbarbette on a pintle. This is probably the first time in land fighting\nthat such a piece was ever silenced by machine-gun fire. The range I\nused was 2,000 yards (estimated).",
        "The guns were used during the remainder of the fighting in the\ntrenches. I took off the wheels and put the guns on the carriages in\nemplacements, erecting a sandbag parapet in front as cover during the\nnight of July 4th. The disabled gun was brought up and repaired,\nsubsequently participating in the fighting. The dynamite gun, under\nSergeant Borrowe, 1st Volunteer Cavalry, cooperated with the battery\nthus formed, and the whole battery, including the two Colt automatic\nrapid-fire guns under Lieut. Tiffany, 1st United States Volunteer\nCavalry, did good work in all the subsequent fighting. I supplied\nabout eight thousand rounds of captured Mauser cartridges to Tiffany,\nwhich had been captured by my battery, and which he used effectively\nin his Colt’s guns. I had a strong fire directed upon a battery of\nseven pieces of the enemy’s artillery at a distance of 1,500 yards in\nfront every time any attempt was made to use this battery. The result\nwas that only three shots were fired from these guns after July 4th. I\nvisited this battery after the surrender and found every gun in\nworking order, the 16 cm. gun being actually loaded. As no\norganization, except my battery, of which I had general direction, had\nsuch orders, so far as I can learn, the conclusion is that this\nbattery of machine guns kept out of action seven pieces of the enemy’s\nartillery by making it too warm for his gunners to stay in their\nbatteries.",
        "I have made certain recommendations in hasty reports for gallantry,\nwhich I personally witnessed. They were as follows:",
        "Capt. J. R. F. Landis, 1st Cavalry, medal of honor. Volunteered to\nassist observation of fire July 1st, and rendered great service at\nimminent peril of his life made necessary in order to render such\nservice.",
        "Sergeant John N. Weigle, 9th Infantry, 2d Lieutenant U. S. Army\n(regulars). For conspicuous daring, intelligence, and coolness in\naction, July 1st.",
        "Corporal Charles C. Steigenwald, 13th Infantry, 2d Lieutenant U. S.\nArmy (regulars). For coolness and judgment in keeping his gun in\naction with only one man to help on July 1st.",
        "Private Fred C. Elkins, 17th Infantry, 2d Lieutenant United States\nVolunteers. For conspicuous daring and courage in action. Although\nwounded, he remained at his post until he fell from exhaustion, July\n1st.",
        "Corporal Matthew Doyle, 13th Infantry, medal of honor. Conspicuous\ngallantry and coolness in action. When, two men had been shot down by\nhis side he continued to work his gun effectively alone until\nassistance arrived, July 1st.",
        "Sergt. Green, Company H, 13th Infantry, medal of honor. Conspicuous\ncoolness and steadiness in handling his piece under hot fire, July\n1st.",
        "Sergt. John Graham, 10th Cavalry, medal of honor. Conspicuous coolness\nand steadiness under fire, July 1st.",
        "Sergt. Weischaar, Company A, 13th Infantry, certificate of merit.\nParticularly meritorious steadiness, night of July 6th. Being put on\noutpost duty with a Gatling gun in time of truce, and having been\nalarmed by a sentinel, whose duty it was to warn him of the enemy’s\napproach, he coolly reserved his fire for personal investigation and\nprevented a violation of the truce.",
        "Sergt. Ryder, Company G, 13th Infantry, certificate of merit.\nParticularly meritorious steadiness, night of July 6th. Being on\noutpost duty with a Gatling gun in time of truce, and having been\nalarmed by a sentinel, whose duty it was to warn him of the enemy’s\napproach, he coolly held his fire for personal investigation and\nprevented a violation of the truce.",
        "In making these recommendations, I have limited myself to those which\nI personally observed. If I recommended for every deserving act, there\nis not a man in my whole detachment who has not deserved a certificate\nof merit. They were selected in the beginning from an army corps for\nwhat I knew of them, and they have abundantly justified my confidence\nin them. With a less efficient personnel it would have been absolutely\nimpossible to organize, equip and instruct the first battery of\nGatling guns ever used in the history of war, in the short space of\ntime allotted me, and put it in efficient fighting shape. They fought\ntheir guns on the skirmish line and in advance of it, standing boldly\nup to do it when the skirmishers themselves lay down close for cover.\nMy loss, as footed up on the night of July 1st, was 33 1-3 per cent,\nkilled, wounded, and missing. The efficiency of the work of my guns\nwas attested to me by numerous Spanish officers and prisoners. Their\nfavorite expression was: “It was terrible when your guns opened,\nalways. They went b-r-r-r-r, like a lawn mower cutting the grass over\nour trenches. We could not stick a finger up when you fired without\ngetting it cut off–so!”",
        "The work of this experimental battery proves that in this weapon we\nhave a new arm supplementary to infantry and cavalry, independent of\nboth as one arm is of another, and more nearly capable of independent\naction than any other arm of the service. It is equally demonstrated\nthat this new arm is entirely different from artillery in its\nfunctions, and can live where the latter is compelled to retire.",
        "It should, therefore, be organized as a separate arm. I have, at the\nrequest of General Wheeler, drawn up a scheme of such an organization\nand submitted it to him.",
        "Experience shows me that the carriage is too heavy. I can only renew\nthe representations contained in my letter of January 1, 1898, to the\nAdjutant General, accompanying drawing, etc., of my proposed carriage\nfor machine guns. I would now, based on experience, modify my theory\nof organization as then proposed, and would make several changes in\nthe model of carriage then proposed without departing from the general\nprinciples.",
        "If any expression of such views is desired, I shall be very glad to\nsubmit them when called upon by the War Department to do so.",
        "Very respectfully,",
        "John H. Parker,\n2d Lieut., 13th Infantry,\nCommanding Gatling Gun Detachment, 5th Corps.",
