        "In the present reprint the text of the original edition of this work has\nbeen reproduced without change, even the curious transliterations of the\nvernacular words and phrases having been preserved. The correct forms of\nthese, so far as they have been ascertained, have been given in the Notes\nand in the Index-Glossary. I have added an Introduction containing an\naccount of the authoress based on the scanty information available, and I\nhave compiled some notes illustrating questions connected with Islam\nand Musalman usages. I have not thought it necessary to give detailed\nreferences in the notes, but a list of the works which have been used will\nbe found at the end of the text. As in other volumes of this series, the\ndiacritical marks indicating the varieties of the sound of certain letters\nin the Arabic and Devanagari alphabets have not been given: they are\nunnecessary for the scholar and serve only to embarrass the general reader.",
        "I have to acknowledge help from several friends in the preparation of this\nedition. Mr. W. Foster, C.I.E., has supplied valuable notes from the India\nOffice records on Mir Hasan ’Ali and his family; Dr. W. Hoey, late\nI.C.S., and Mr. L.N. Jopling, I.C.S., Deputy-Commissioner, Lucknow, have\nmade inquiries on the same subject. Mr. H.C. Irwin, late I.C.S., has\nfurnished much information on Oudh affairs in the time of the Nawabi.\nSir C.J. Lyall, K.C.S.I, C.I.E., and Professor E.G. Browne, M.A., have\npermitted me to consult them on certain obscure words in the text.",
