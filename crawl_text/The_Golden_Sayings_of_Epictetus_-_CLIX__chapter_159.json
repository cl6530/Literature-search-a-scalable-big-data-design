        "Remember that in life thou shouldst order thy conduct as at\na banquet. Has any dish that is being served reached thee?\nStretch forth thy hand and help thyself modestly. Doth it pass\nthee by? Seek not to detain it. Has it not yet come? Send not\nforth thy desire to meet it, but wait until it reaches thee. Deal\nthus with children, thus with wife; thus with office, thus with\nwealthâ€”and one day thou wilt be meet to share the Banquets of\nthe Gods. But if thou dost not so much as touch that which is\nplaced before thee, but despisest it, then shalt thou not only\nshare the Banquets of the Gods, but their Empire also.",
