        "AN INTERRUPTION",
        "When Hamdi Bey had taken Aimée back to her apartments he pulled\nsharply upon a bellcord. In a few moments the slave woman, Fatima,\nmade her appearance, no kindly-eyed old crone like Miriam, but a\nsallow, furtive-faced creature, with an old disfiguring scar across\na cheek.",
        "The general pointed to the wet and fainting girl huddling weakly\nupon the divan.",
        "“Your new mistress has met with an accident, out boating–a curse\nupon me for gratifying forbidden caprice!” he said crisply. “Be\nsilent of this and array her quickly in garments of rest. I will\nreturn.”",
        "Very hurriedly he took himself and his own wet condition away. He\nwas furious, through and through. What a night–what a wedding\nnight! Scandal and frustration... a bride with a desperate lover...\na bride who, herself, drew revolvers and threatened.",
        "It was beyond any old tale of the palace. For less, girls had had\nhis father’s dagger driven through their hearts–his grandfather, at\na mere whisper from a eunuch, had given his favorite to the lion.\nThe whisper was found incorrect at a later–too late–date, and the\neunuch had furnished the lion another meal.",
        "His modern leniency in this case would have outraged his ancestors.",
        "But it was not in the bey’s nature to deal the finishing stroke to\nanything so soft and lovely as Aimée. He had no intention of\ndepriving himself of her. If she were red with guilt he would feign\nbelief in her, to save his face until his infatuation was gratified.",
        "But actually he did not believe in any great guilt of hers. Tewfick\nPasha, for all his indulgent modernity, would keep too strict a\nharem for that. What he rather believed, had happened was that the\nyoung American–now so happily immured in his masonry–had become\naware of the girl through the story of her French father, and in\nthat connection had struck up the clandestine and romantic\ncorrespondence which had led to their mutual infatuation and his\ndesperate venture there that afternoon.",
        "The young man had been dealt with–and the thought of the very\nsummary and competent way he had been dealt with drew the fangs from\nthe bite of that night’s invasion.",
        "His fury felt soothingly glutted.",
        "He had been a match for them both. He recalled his own subtlety and\nagility with a genuine smile as he exchanged his dripping uniform\nfor more informal trousers and a house coat. He had taught that\nyoung man a lesson–a final and ultimate lesson. And he was\nbeginning to teach one to that girl. Before he was done with\nher ...",
        "He felt for her a mingled passion for her beauty and a lust for\nconquest of her resistant spirit that fed every base and cruel\ninstinct of his nature.",
        "A find–a rare find–even with her circumvented lover! He would have\nhis sport with her.... But though he promised this to himself with\nfeline relish, apprehension and chagrin were still working.",
        "The fond fatuity with which he had welcomed that starry-eyed little\ncreature had been rudely overthrown. And his pride smarted at the\nidea of the whispers that might echo and re-echo through his palace.\nHe was too wise an old hand to flatter himself that it would\npreserve its bland and silent unawareness of this night.",
        "So far, he believed, he had been unobserved. In Yussuf’s silence he\nhad absolute confidence.... But of course there were a hundred other\nchances–some spying, back-stairs eye, some curious, straining\near....",
        "And for this matter of the boating mishap–he cursed himself now, as\nhe combed up his fair mustaches and settled a scarlet fez upon his\nthinned thatch of graying hair, cursed himself roundly for his\nmalicious resort to that old oubliette. Anything else would have\ndone to frighten and overwhelm her and yet he had gratified his\ndramatic itch–and now had paid for it with that idiotic story of\nthe boating expedition.",
        "He had reason to trust Fatima–there was history behind the old\nsword scar upon her cheek, and he had a hold over her through her\nambition for a son. But Fatima was a woman. And she–or some other\nwho would see that drenched satin would be curious of that boating\nstory....",
        "And of course they could find out from the boatman.",
        "It occurred to him to go and see the boatman and order him away so\nthat afterward the man could say he had been sent off duty, and the\nstory of a nocturnal river trip would not appear too incredible. It\nwas a small concession to stop gossip’s mouth.",
        "So drawing on a swinging military cloak, the general stole down\nthrough the stair of the water entrance into the lower hall, where\nthe pale light gleamed through the cross-barred iron of the gate and\nthe gatekeeper slept like a log in his muffling cloak.",
        "The soundness of that slumber–loudly attested by the fumes of\nwine–afforded the general a profound pleasure. He took the man’s\nkeys softly, and went to the gate; it afforded him less pleasure to\nobserve that the gate was unlocked, but he put this down to the\nkeeper’s muddleheadedness.",
        "Carefully he turned the lock and pocketed the keys–for a lesson to\nthe man’s overdeep sleep in the morning and to attest his own\npresence there that night; then he went back and brought out an oar,\nwhich he placed conspicuously beside the smallest boat, drawn up\njust within the gates.",
        "He was afraid to alter the boat’s position lest the noise should\nprove too wakening, but he considered he had laid an artistic\nfoundation for his story and with a gratifying sense of triumph he\nmounted the stairs.",
        "He was not conscious of fatigue. He had always been a wiry,\nindefatigable person, and the alarms and emotions of this night had\ncleared his head of its wines and drowsiness. He felt the sense of\ntense, highstrung power which came to him in war, in fighting, in\nany element of danger.",
        "Youth! He snapped his fingers at it. Youth was buried in\nhis masonry–and helpless in its shuttered room. Power was\nmaster–power, craft, subtlety.",
        "But his elation ebbed as he crossed again that long drawing room\nwith its faded flowers about the marriage throne, and its abandoned\ntable with its cloth askew, its crystal disarrayed, its candles\ngutted and spent.",
        "The memory of that insolent moment when a man’s hand had gripped\nhim, had whirled him from Aimée–when a man’s voice and gun had\nthreatened him–that memory was too overpowering for even his\ntriumph over the invader to lay wholly its smart of outrage.",
        "He felt again the tightening of his nerves, like quivering wires, as\nhe crossed the violated reception room and entered the boudoir. It\nwas empty, but on the divan the flickering candle light revealed the\ndamp, spreading stain where Aimée’s drenched satins had been.",
        "He thrust aside a hanging and pushed open the door into the room\nbeyond.",
        "It was a small bedroom evidently very recently furnished in new and\nwhite shining lacquer of French design, elaborately inlaid with\npainted porcelains and draped with a profusion of rosy taffeta.\nAmong this elegance, surprisingly unrelated to the ancient paneled\nwalls, stood the hastily opened trunk and bags of the bride, their\nraised lids and disarranged trays heaped with the confusion of\nunaccustomed, swiftly searching hands.",
        "Aimée herself, in a gay little French boudoir robe of jade and\ncitron, sat huddled in a chair, like a mute, terrified child, in the\nhand of her dresser, who was shaking out the long, damp hair and\nfanning it with a peacock fan.",
        "At the bey’s entrance Fatima suspended the fanning, but with easy\nfamiliarity exhibited the long ringlets.",
        "Curtly the bey nodded, and gestured in dismissal; the woman laid\ndown her fan, and with a last slant-eyed look at that strangely\nstill new mistress she went noiselessly out a small service door.",
        "With an air of negligent assurance Hamdi Bey gazed about the room\nand yawned. “Truly a fatiguing evening,” he remarked in his dry,\nsardonic voice. “But you look so untouched! What a thing is radiant\nyouth.”",
        "He sauntered over to her, who drew a little closer together at his\napproach, and lifted one of the long dark curls that the serving\nwoman had exhibited.",
        "“The ringlets of loveliness,” he murmured. “You know the old saying\nof the Sadi? ’The ringlets of the lovely are a chain on the feet of\nreason and a snare for the bird of wisdom.’... How long ago he said\nit–and how true to-day ... Yet such a charming chain! Suppose,\nthen, I forgive you, little one, since sages have forgiven beauty\nbefore?”",
        "She was silent, her eyes fixed on him with the silent terror with\nwhich a trapped bird sees its captor, in their bright darkness the\nsame mute apprehension, the same filming of helpless despair.",
        "Ryder was dead, she thought. This cruel, incensed old madman had\nkilled him, for all his oaths. Somewhere beneath those ancient\nstones he was lying drowned and dead, a strange, pitiable addition\nto the dark secrets of those grim walls.",
        "He had died for her sake, and all that she asked now of life, she\nthought in the utter agony of her youth, was death. And very\nquickly.",
        "“I am so soft hearted,” he sighed, still with that ringlet in his\nlifted hand, his hand which wanted palpably to settle upon her and\nyet was withheld by some strange inhibition of those fixed, helpless\neyes. “Who knows–perhaps I may forgive you yet? You might persuade\nme–”",
        "“He is dead,” she said shiveringly.",
        "“Dead? He?... Ah, the invader, the intruder, the young man who\nwanted you for a family in France!” The bey laughed gratingly. “No,\nI assure you he is not dead–I have not harmed a hair of his head.\nHe is alive–only not with quite the widest range of liberty–”",
        "He broke off to laugh again. “Ah, you disbelieve?” he said politely.\n“Shall I send, then, for some proof–an ear, perhaps, or a little\nfinger, still very warm and bleeding, to convince you?... In five\nminutes it will be here.”",
        "Then terror stirred again in her frozen heart. If Ryder were alive\nand still in this man’s power–",
        "“You are horrible,” she said to him in a voice that was suddenly\nclear and unshaken. “What is it you want of me–fear and hate–and\nutter loathing?”",
        "Her unexpected spirit was briefly disconcerting. The Turk looked\ndown upon her in arrested irony and then he smiled beneath his\nmustaches and bent nearer with kindling gaze.",
        "“Not at all–nothing at all like that, little dove with talons. I\nwant sweetness and repentance–and submission. And–”",
        "“You have a strange way to win them,” she said desperately.",
        "“You have taken a strange way with me, my love! Little did I\nforesee, when I escorted you up the stairs this morning–” He broke\noff. “There are men,” he reminded her, “who would not consider a\ncold bath as a complete recompense for your bridal plans.”",
        "She was silent.",
        "“But I,” he murmured, “I am soft hearted.” He dropped on one knee\nbefore her and tried to smile into her averted face. “I can never\nresist a charming penitent.... I assure you I am pliability itself\nin delicate fingers–although iron and steel to a threatening\nhand.... If you should woo me very sweetly, little one–”",
        "She could not overcome and she could not hide from his mocking eyes\nthe sick shrinking that drew her back from his least touch. But she\ndid fight down the wild hysteria of her repugnance so that her voice\nwas not the trembling gasp it wanted to be.",
        "“How can I know what you are?” she told him. “You mock me–you\nthreaten to torture that man–it would be folly not to think that\nyou are deceiving me. If you would only prove to me so that I could\nbelieve–”",
        "“If you would but prove to me so that I could believe–! Prove\nthat you are mine–and not that infidel’s. Prove that you bring me a\nwife’s devotion–not a wanton’s indifference.” He caught her cold\nhands, trying to draw her forward to him. “Prove that you only pity\nhim,” he whispered, “but that your love will be mine–”",
        "She felt as if a serpent clasped her. And yet, if that were the only\nway to win Ryder’s safety–if it were possible for her sickened\nsenses to allay this madman’s suspicions and undermine his revenge–",
        "Quiveringly she thought that to save Ryder she would go through\nfire.",
        "But the hideous, mocking uncertainties! Her utter helplessness–her\nlost deference....",
        "It was not a sudden sound that broke in upon them but rather the\nperception of many sounds, muffled, half heard, but gaining upon\ntheir consciousness. Running feet–a stifled voice–something faint\nand shrill–",
        "Aimée sprang to her feet; the general rose with her and turned his\nhead inquiringly in the direction. Then he jerked open the door\nthrough which Fatima had disappeared; it led to a dark service\ncorridor and small anteroom, from whose bed the attendant was\nabsent. An outer door was ajar.",
        "No need to question the sounds now. Faint, but piercingly shrill\nshrieks were sounding from above, while the footsteps were racing,\nsome down, some up–",
        "The bey flung shut the door behind him and hurried towards the\nconfusion.",
