        "Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to\ndo all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the\ngirl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang\nout of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of\nher misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after\ngiving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ’As you have let the\nspindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’",
        "The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.",
        "She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers\nblooming in every direction.",
        "She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ’Take us out, take us\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through\nlong ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.",
        "She went on a little farther, till she came to a free full of apples.\n’Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ’my apples, one and all,\nare ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down\nupon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a\nsingle apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples\ntogether in a heap and walked on again.",
        "The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an\nold woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified,\nand turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ’What are\nyou afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my\nhouse properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very\ncareful, however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you\nalways to shake it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then\nthey say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother\nHolle.’ The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up\ncourage and agreed to enter into her service.",
        "She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding\nand every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so\nthat the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman\nwas as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her\nroast and boiled meats every day.",
        "So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew\nshe was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with\nMother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile,\nshe went to Mother Holle and said, ’I am so homesick, that I cannot\nstay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must\nreturn to my own people.’",
        "Then Mother Holle said, ’I am pleased that you should want to go back\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully,\nI will take you home myself.’",
        "Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\nhead to foot.",
        "’That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.",
        "The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\nworld close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:",
        " ’Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’",
        "Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by\nher great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter\nto go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the\nwell and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand\ninto a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the\nspindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.",
        "Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\ntill she came to the oven. ’Take us out, take us out, or alas! we\nshall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the\nloaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, ’Do you think I am going\nto dirty my hands for you?’ and walked on.",
        "Presently she came to the apple-tree. ’Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\napples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ’A\nnice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’\nand passed on.",
        "At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all\nabout the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and\nengaged herself without delay to the old woman.",
        "The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted\nherself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should\nget in return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her\nwork, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie\nin bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she\nneglected to make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it\nso that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got\ntired of her, and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted\nat this, and thought to herself, ’The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother\nHolle led her, as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as\nshe was passing through, instead of the shower of gold, a great\nbucketful of pitch came pouring over her.",
        "’That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she\nshut the gate.",
        "So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on\nthe well called out as she saw her:",
        " ’Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’",
        "But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck\nto her as long as she lived.",
