        "Laramie has a seal brown goat, with iron gray chin whiskers and a breath\nlike new mown hay.",
        "He has not had as hard a winter as the majority of stock on the Rocky\nmountains, because he is of a domestic turn of mind and tries to make man\nhis friend. Though social in his nature, he never intrudes himself on\npeople after they have intimated with a shotgun that they are weary of\nhim.",
        "When the world seems cold and dark to him, and everybody turns coldly away\nfrom him, he does not steal away by himself and die of corroding grief; he\njust lies down on the sidewalk in the sun and fills the air with the\nseductive fragrance of which he is the sole proprietor.",
        "One day, just as he had eaten his midday meal of boot heels and cold\nsliced atmosphere and kerosene barrel staves, he saw a man going along the\nstreet with a large looking glass under his arm.",
        "The goat watched the man, and saw him set the mirror down by a gate and go\ninside the house after some more things that he was moving. Then the goat\nstammered with his tail a few times and went up to see if he could eat the\nmirror.",
        "When he got pretty close to it, he saw a hungry-looking goat apparently\ncoming toward him, so he backed off a few yards and went for him. There\nwas a loud crash, and when the man came out he saw a full length portrait\nof a goat with a heavy, black walnut frame around it, going down the\nstreet with a great deal of apparent relish.",
        "Then the man said something derogatory about the goat, and seemed offended\nabout something.",
        "Goats are not timid in their nature and are easily domesticated.",
        "There are two kinds of goatâ€“the cashmere goat and the plain goat. The\nformer is worked up into cashmere shawls and cashmere bouquet. The latter\nis not.",
        "The cashmere bouquet of commerce is not made of the common goat. It is a\ngood thing that it is not.",
        "A goat that has always been treated with uniform kindness and never\nbetrayed, may be taught to eat out of the hand. Also out of the flour\nbarrel or the ice-cream freezer.",
