        "BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT QUARRELS\nWERE FORGOTTEN WHEN THE TURKS\nTOOK THE HOLY LAND, DESECRATED THE\nHOLY PLACES AND INTERFERED SERIOUSLY\nWITH THE TRADE FROM EAST TO\nWEST. EUROPE WENT CRUSADING",
        "DURING three centuries there had been peace between Christians\nand Moslems except in Spain and in the eastern Roman\nEmpire, the two states defending the gateways of Europe.\nThe Mohammedans having conquered Syria in the seventh\ncentury were in possession of the Holy Land. But they regarded\nJesus as a great prophet (though not quite as great\nas Mohammed), and they did not interfere with the pilgrims\nwho wished to pray in the church which Saint Helena, the\nmother of the Emperor Constantine, had built on the spot of\nthe Holy Grave. But early in the eleventh century, a Tartar\ntribe from the wilds of Asia, called the Seljuks or Turks,\nbecame masters of the Mohammedan state in western Asia and\nthen the period of tolerance came to an end. The Turks took\nall of Asia Minor away from the eastern Roman Emperors\nand they made an end to the trade between east and west.",
        "Alexis, the Emperor, who rarely saw anything of his Christian\nneighbours of the west, appealed for help and pointed to\nthe danger which threatened Europe should the Turks take\nConstantinople.",
        "The Italian cities which had established colonies along the\ncoast of Asia Minor and Palestine, in fear for their possessions,\nreported terrible stories of Turkish atrocities and Christian\nsuffering. All Europe got excited.",
        "Pope Urban II, a Frenchman from Reims, who had been\neducated at the same famous cloister of Cluny which had\ntrained Gregory VII, thought that the time had come for\naction. The general state of Europe was far from satisfactory.\nThe primitive agricultural methods of that day (unchanged\nsince Roman times) caused a constant scarcity of food. There\nwas unemployment and hunger and these are apt to lead to\ndiscontent and riots. Western Asia in older days had fed millions.\nIt was an excellent field for the purpose of immigration.",
        "Therefore at the council of Clermont in France in the year\n1095 the Pope arose, described the terrible horrors which the\ninfidels had inflicted upon the Holy Land, gave a glowing\ndescription of this country which ever since the days of Moses\nhad been overflowing with milk and honey, and exhorted the\nknights of France and the people of Europe in general to\nleave wife and child and deliver Palestine from the Turks.",
        "A wave of religious hysteria swept across the continent.\nAll reason stopped. Men would drop their hammer and saw,\nwalk out of their shop and take the nearest road to the east\nto go and kill Turks. Children would leave their homes to “go\nto Palestine” and bring the terrible Turks to their knees by\nthe mere appeal of their youthful zeal and Christian piety.\nFully ninety percent of those enthusiasts never got within\nsight of the Holy Land. They had no money. They were\nforced to beg or steal to keep alive. They became a danger\nto the safety of the highroads and they were killed by the\nangry country people.",
        "The first Crusade, a wild mob of honest Christians, defaulting\nbankrupts, penniless noblemen and fugitives from justice,\nfollowing the lead of half-crazy Peter the Hermit and Walter-\nwithout-a-Cent, began their campaign against the Infidels by\nmurdering all the Jews whom they met by the way. They\ngot as far as Hungary and then they were all killed.",
        "This experience taught the Church a lesson. Enthusiasm\nalone would not set the Holy Land free. Organisation was\nas necessary as good-will and courage. A year was spent in\ntraining and equipping an army of 200,000 men. They were\nplaced under command of Godfrey of Bouillon, Robert, duke\nof Normandy, Robert, count of Flanders, and a number of\nother noblemen, all experienced in the art of war.",
        "In the year 1096 this second crusade started upon its long\nvoyage. At Constantinople the knights did homage to the\nEmperor. (For as I have told you, traditions die hard, and\na Roman Emperor, however poor and powerless, was still held\nin great respect). Then they crossed into Asia, killed all the\nMoslems who fell into their hands, stormed Jerusalem, massacred\nthe Mohammedan population, and marched to the Holy\nSepulchre to give praise and thanks amidst tears of piety and\ngratitude. But soon the Turks were strengthened by the arrival\nof fresh troops. Then they retook Jerusalem and in turn\nkilled the faithful followers of the Cross.",
        "During the next two centuries, seven other crusades took\nplace. Gradually the Crusaders learned the technique of the\ntrip. The land voyage was too tedious and too dangerous.\nThey preferred to cross the Alps and go to Genoa or Venice\nwhere they took ship for the east. The Genoese and the Venetians\nmade this trans-Mediterranean passenger service a very\nprofitable business. They charged exorbitant rates, and when\nthe Crusaders (most of whom had very little money) could not\npay the price, these Italian “profiteers” kindly allowed them\nto “work their way across.” In return for a fare from Venice\nto Acre, the Crusader undertook to do a stated amount of\nfighting for the owners of his vessel. In this way Venice greatly\nincreased her territory along the coast of the Adriatic and in\nGreece, where Athens became a Venetian colony, and in the\nislands of Cyprus and Crete and Rhodes.",
        "All this, however, helped little in settling the question\nof the Holy Land. After the first enthusiasm had\nworn off, a short crusading trip became part of the liberal\neducation of every well-bred young man, and there\nnever was any lack of candidates for service in Palestine.\nBut the old zeal was gone. The Crusaders, who\nhad begun their warfare with deep hatred for the\nMohammedans and great love for the Christian people\nof the eastern Roman Empire and Armenia, suffered\na complete change of heart. They came to despise the\nGreeks of Byzantium, who cheated them and frequently betrayed\nthe cause of the Cross, and the Armenians and all the\nother Levantine races, and they began to appreciate the vir-\ntues of their enemies who proved to be generous and fair\nopponents.",
        "Of course, it would never do to say this openly. But when\nthe Crusader returned home, he was likely to imitate the manners\nwhich he had learned from his heathenish foe, compared\nto whom the average western knight was still a good deal of a\ncountry bumpkin. He also brought with him several new\nfood-stuffs, such as peaches and spinach which he planted in his\ngarden and grew for his own benefit. He gave up the barbarous\ncustom of wearing a load of heavy armour and appeared\nin the flowing robes of silk or cotton which were the traditional\nhabit of the followers of the Prophet and were originally worn\nby the Turks. Indeed the Crusades, which had begun as a\npunitive expedition against the Heathen, became a course of\ngeneral instruction in civilisation for millions of young Europeans.",
        "From a military and political point of view the Crusades\nwere a failure. Jerusalem and a number of cities were taken\nand lost. A dozen little kingdoms were established in Syria\nand Palestine and Asia Minor, but they were re-conquered by\nthe Turks and after the year 1244 (when Jerusalem became\ndefinitely Turkish) the status of the Holy Land was the same\nas it had been before 1095.",
        "But Europe had undergone a great change. The people of\nthe west had been allowed a glimpse of the light and the sunshine\nand the beauty of the east. Their dreary castles no\nlonger satisfied them. They wanted a broader life. Neither\nChurch nor State could give this to them.",
        "They found it in the cities.",
