        "Labour problems have always existed, but the development of\nindustrialism as we know it to-day is comparatively modern. It dates\nfrom the introduction of machinery and mechanical transport, and\ncoincided in its beginnings with the vogue of the so-called\n“Manchester School” in political and economic theory. The modern world\nof industry has been built up by the enterprise of capitalists working\nupon the basis of unrestricted competition. Joint-stock companies and\n“trusts” are simply capitalistic combinations for the exploitation of\nindustrial opportunities upon a larger scale.",
        "The economic theorists of the Manchester School regarded wages as\nnecessarily governed by the working of the “iron law” of supply and\ndemand. It was the “interest” of the employer to buy such labour as\nwas required at as cheap a rate as possible. It was assumed that in\nthis, as in other matters of “business,” his procedure must be\ndetermined wholly by self-interest, to the exclusion of “sentimental\"\nconsiderations. Individual employers might be better than their creed,\nand in the smaller “concerns” the relations between employer and\nemployed were often humanized by personal knowledge and intercourse.\nWith the advent of the joint-stock company this no longer held good.\n“A corporation has no bowels.” Directors were not personally in\ncontact with their workpeople, and their main consideration was for\ntheir shareholders. The whole tendency of the industrial order of\nsociety as it developed was in the direction of the exploitation of\nthe workman in the interests of “capital.”",
        "It was not that members of the employing class were consciously\ninhuman. It was simply that they were blinded to the human problems\nwhich were involved. They had become accustomed to regard as natural\nand inevitable a wage-slavery of the many to the few. Labour was a\ncommodity in the market. The workman was a unit of labour. Regarded\nfrom the point of view of Capital he represented simply the\npotentiality of so many foot-pounds of more or less intelligently-\ndirected energy per diem. His life as a human being, apart from the\neconomic value of his labour, was from the “business” point of view\nirrelevant.",
        "The system was based upon a lie. “Treat human beings as machines as\nmuch as you will, the fact remains that they are incurably personal.\"\nThe wage-slaves of the modern world asserted their personality, and\nthe modern Socialist-Labour Movement is the result. The forces of\norganized labour have won some notable victories. They are a\nrecognized power in the land. There are those who hope, and those who\nfear, that they will in the end become socially and politically\nomnipotent. It is now generally recognized that society prior to the\nwar was on the brink of a struggle between the classes of great\nbitterness, and that the social condition of the country after the war\nis likely to be fraught with formidable possibilities. There are many\nobservers who regard a social revolution, in one form or another, as\ninevitable.",
        "Much, no doubt, will depend upon the temper of the returning troops,\nboth officers and men. That men and officers have learnt to know and\nto respect one another upon the battlefield is acknowledged, but those\nwho imagine that herein is contained a solution of social and labour\nproblems are likely to prove grievously disappointed. A great deal of\nnonsense is being talked about the effects of “discipline” upon the\nmen. Military discipline has its admirers: but men of mature years and\ncivilian traditions who in the present conflict have served in the\nranks of His Majesty’s Army are not included among their number. They\nhave submitted to discipline for the period of their military service.\nThey are quite able to recognize that it is essential to the\nefficiency of the army as a fighting machine. But they conceive\nthemselves to have been fighting for freedom: and their own freedom\nand that of their children and of their class is included in their\neyes among the objects for which they fight. They will be more than\never jealous, after the war, of their recovered liberties, and\ndetermined to assert them. It is probable that one result of\ndemobilization will be an enormous accession of strength to the ranks\nof the Socialist and Labour parties. The “class war” with which\nsociety was threatened before the European War broke out is not likely\nto be a less present danger when “that which now restraineth “is\nremoved by the conclusion of peace.",
        "What in relation to these problems is the message of the Christian\nChurch? The distinctively Christian ethic is based not upon self-\nassertion but upon self-sacrifice, not upon class distinctions but\nupon brotherhood. “Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbour’s\ngood.” The principle is of corporate as well as of individual\napplication. In an ideally Christian society, the interests of\n“Labour” would be the sole concern of “Capital,” the interests of\n“Capital” the sole concern of “Labour”: and the message of the Church\nto the contending parties should be, now as always, “Sirs, ye are\nbrethren.”",
        "Neither party, however, is likely at present to pay much heed to such\na message, which is apt to sound like an abstract and theoretical\ntruism remote from the actualities of life. In point of fact, the\nlarge sections of the population who live permanently near or below\nthe poverty line are largely precluded by lack of leisure from\nentering into the Christian heritage of the spiritual life, and are\ntoo much obsessed by the daily struggle for material existence to have\npatience with exhortations to regard with sympathy either the\ntemptations or the good intentions of the well-to-do. The latter in\nturn are apt to resent any attempt to stir in them a social conscience\nwith regard to the problems of poverty or the fundamental causes of\nlabour “unrest,” to regard the security of dividends as conveniently\nguaranteed by the laws of GOD, and to hold, in a general way, that\neverything has hitherto been ordered for the best in the best of all\npossible worlds. The Church–and more particularly the Church of\nEngland–is commonly regarded both by “Labour” and by “Capital” as\ntraditionally identified with the Conservative Party in politics. The\nChurch-going classes love to have it so, and the world of Labour not\nunnaturally holds aloof.",
        "It is nevertheless sufficiently obvious that the future of\ncivilization after the war will be largely in the hands (or at the\nmercy) of organized Labour. And it is worth remembering that our\nSaviour died not for the rich only, but for the poor, having moreover\nHimself lived and worked as a labouring Man. There are those who\nregard the spirit of idealism and world-wide brotherhood by which the\nLabour Movement is inspired as the most profoundly Christian element\nin the life of the modern world, and the existing cleavage between\nLabour and the Church as a tragedy comparable only to the tragedy of\nthe war. It is the plain duty of a Christian man to do what in him\nlies to remedy this cleavage, to think hard and honestly about social\nproblems from a Christian point of view, and to make it his business\nto have an adequate understanding and sympathy with the real character\nand motives of Labour aspirations and ideals.",
