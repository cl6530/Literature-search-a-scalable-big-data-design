        "THE FORTY DOORS",
        "When Ryder had despatched from the jeweler’s who had polished the\nlocket for him, that package with its secret note, and its warning\nplaid, he had no real assurance that the message would fall into\nAimée’s hands. But he could think of nothing better, and he argued\nvery favorably for his stratagem.",
        "That miniature should have some effect, and given the miniature, and\nthe bit of plaid cloth, Aimée’s quick wit ought to divine a message.",
        "She had always the key, he remembered, and the power of egress from\nher prison. And surely it ought not to be difficult for her to\ndevise some way of getting a letter into the post.",
        "So his hope fluctuated between the garden gate and the daily mail at\nthe Bank, and he rather surprised McLean by the frequency and\nbrevity of his visits, and by the duration of his stay in Cairo.",
        "For that he had an excuse, both to McLean and to the deserted\nThatcher, at the excavation camp, two excuses in fact–some belated\nidentification work to be done at the Museum and a cracked wisdom\ntooth.",
        "Chiefly he spoke of the necessity for dentistry and accounted for\nhis moods with his molar.",
        "Of moods he had many. Moods when he contemplated his behavior\nlightly and brightly or darkly, in unrelieved disgust, moods when he\nrefused to contemplate it at all. But he stayed. That was the\nconspicuous and enduring thing. He stayed.",
        "Jinny Jeffries returned from the Nile by express to find him\nensconced at her hotel, and her bright confidence suffered no\ndiminution of its self respect. And it was through Jinny that chance\nset another straw of circumstance dancing his way.",
        "Jinny had a frock she wished repaired. Mrs. Heath-Brown, whom she\nhad met upon the Nile, recommended to her a Mrs. Hendricks, wife of\na British soldier and a most clever little needle woman. Jinny\nlooked up Mrs. Hendricks and found it impossible to secure her for\nsome days as she was busy refitting for a fashionable wedding in the\nMohammedan world.",
        "A night later, and two nights before the wedding, Jinny made a\nnarrative of the circumstances for Jack Ryder’s benefit.",
        "“Such frocks h’as h’I ’ave to do–and the young lady no more\ncaring!” had been a saying of the Hendricks that Jinny passed\ninterestedly on to Jack. She had no memory of the young lady’s name,\nbut distinctly she recalled that she was young and beautiful and to\nmarry a general.",
        "It was enough to launch Jinny’s eager interest in Mohammedan\nmarriages and foster the wish that she might attend one. She\nregretted Mrs. Heath-Brown’s absence and her lack of acquaintance,\nand suggested that Jack ought to know some one–",
        "“Better than that, I’ll take you,” said Jack with a promptness\nthat brought a light to Miss Jeffries’ eyes.",
        "There was also a light in Jack Ryder’s eyes, a swift burning of\nexcitement and adventure.",
        "Why not? The thing was possible. Muffled in a tcharchaf and veiled\nwith a heavy yashmak, armed with enough Arabic for the briefest of\nencounters, he might dare the danger. Who in the world would\ndiscover him? Who would ever know?",
        "The thing was unthinkable. It was a desperate desecration,\ncomparable only, in his vague analogies, to the Mecca pilgrimage and\nprofanation of a Holy Tomb. But its very improbability would prevent\ndetection.",
        "Only Jinny had to keep her mouth extremely shut–before and\nafterwards.",
        "He impressed this upon her so thoroughly, as they did their shopping\nfor the costume together the next morning, that she had compunctious\nmoments of solicitude when she said he really ought not to.... She\nwould feel responsible....",
        "Thereupon he laughed, and dared her to be game, and she grew all\nmirthful confidence again.",
        "But that night, sitting alone in a native café over his Turkish\ncoffee, Ryder was grimly serious.",
        "He knew that it was a mad thing to do. He felt, not so much the\ndanger he ran from discovery, but the danger to his already\nshattered peace of mind from another glimpse of that strange girl\n... that young unknown, on whom he had spent such time and thought,\nof late, that she seemed a very part of his existence.",
        "What was the good of going to her wedding reception? Feebly he told\nhimself that it was his only chance to inform her upon the history\nof the Delcassés. There might have been reasons for her\nnon-appearance at the gate, for her not writing.... He could have no\nglimmering of what went on behind those barred windows. This was his\nonly chance–he meant to say, to tell her–but his eager senses\nmurmured, to see her again.",
        "That was it–to see her again. He owned the lure, at last, with a\nbitter ruefulness. But–he brightened up at that–it was partly his\nduty to himself. Now he had all sorts of fool imaginings about this\ngirl. He was remembering her as something lovelier than a Houri,\nmore enchanting than fairy magic, more sweet than spring. He owed it\nto himself to rout these imbecile prepossessions and prove clearly\nand dispassionately that the girl was just a very nice little girl,\na pretty bride, marrying into a very distinct life from his own–and\na girl with whom he would not have an idea in common. A girl, in\nfact, far inferior to any American. A girl not to be compared to\nJinny Jeffries.",
        "Besides, there was fun in the thing. It tempted him tremendously.\nIt was adventurous, romantic forbidden.",
        "He heard the word echoed in Turkish behind him.",
        "So engrossed in his thoughts had he been that he had been\ninattentive to the rhythm of old Khazib, the tale teller’s voice, as\nhe held forth, from the divan, beside his long-stemmed pipe, to his\nnightly audience, of men and boys, camel drivers, small merchants,\ndesert men from the long caravans who were the frequenters of this\ncafé.",
        "To-night there were few about the old man, and Ryder had small\ndifficulty in drawing nearer the circle. A green-turbaned Arab, with\nthe profile of a Washington and the naïve eyes of youth, whispered\nto him courteously that it was the tale of the Third Kaland, and the\nPrince Azib was in the palace of the forty damsels who were\nfarewelling him, as they were to depart, according to custom, for\nforty days.",
        "Khazib, with a faint salutation of his turban towards the newcomer,\nwent slowly, sonorously on with his tale.",
        "“We fear,” said the damsel unto Azib, “lest thou contraire our\ncharge and disobey our injunctions. Here now we commit to thee the\nkeys of the palace which containeth forty chambers and thou mayest\nopen of these thirty and nine, but beware (and we conjure thee by\nAllah and by the lives of us!) lest thou open the fortieth door, for\ntherein is that which shall separate us forever.”",
        "For a moment the café faded from Ryder’s eyes. He was in the gloom\nof a garden, a shadowy darkness just touched by a crescent moon, and\nbeside him in the shrubbery a dark-shrouded form, shaking its\nshawled head at him in denial, and whispering, lightly but\ntremblingly. “It is a forbidden door ... forbidden as that\nfortieth.... There are thirty and nine doors in your life, monsieur,\nthat you may open, but this is the forbidden....”",
        "He had meant to look up that tale. And now chance was reminding him\nof it again. A superstitious man–Ryder’s great grandfather,\nperhaps, would have felt it an omen of warning, and a devout\nman–Ryder’s grandfather, perhaps–would have taken it for a sign\nfrom Heaven to divert his steps. Ryder reflected upon coincidence.",
        "“When I saw her weeping,” Khazib was intoning, and now Ryder\nattended, his scanty knowledge of the vernacular straining and\noverleaping the blanks, “Prince Azib said to himself, ’By Allah, I\nwill never open that fortieth door, never, and in no wise!’”",
        "“A wise bird,” thought Ryder to himself, drawing on his cigarette.",
        "“And I bade her farewell,” continued the voice slipping into the\nfirst person. “Thereupon all departed, flying like birds, leaving me\nalone in the palace. When evening drew near, I opened the door of\nthe first chamber and found myself in a place like one of the\npleasances of Paradise. It was a garden with trees of freshest\ngreen and ripe fruits of yellow sheen. And I walked among the trees\nand I smelt the breath of the flowers and heard the birds sing their\npraise to Allah, the One, the Almighty.”",
        "“_Allhamdollillah,” murmured Ryder’s neighbors reverently.",
        "“And I looked upon the apple, whose hue is parcel red and parcel\nyellow ... and I looked upon the quince whose fragrance putteth to\nshame musk and ambergris ... and upon the pear whose taste\nsurpasseth sherbet and sugar, and the apricot, whose beauty striketh\nthe eye as she were a polished ruby....",
        "“On the morrow I opened the second door and found myself in a\nspacious plain set with tall date palms and watered by a running\nstream whose banks were shrubbed with rose and jasmine, while privet\nand eglantine, oxe-eye, violet and lily, narcissus, origane and the\nwinter gilliflower carpeted the borders; and the breath of the\nbreeze swept over those sweet-smelling growths....”",
        "How inadequate, Ryder realized, had been the description given by\nthe Book of Genesis to the Garden of Eden.",
        "“And the third door,” droned on the rhythmic voice, “into an open\nhall, hung with cages of sandal-wood and eagle-wood; full of birds\nwhich made sweet music, such as the mocking bird, and the cusha, the\nmerle, the turtle dove–and the Nubian ring-dove.”",
        "A trifle restively Ryder stirred. He liked birds but he wanted to\nbe getting on to that fortieth door and this was slow progress. Not\na sign of impatience marred the bright, absorbed content of the\nother listeners, intent now upon the wonders behind that the fourth\nchamber revealed, stores of “pearls and jacinths and beryls, and\nemeralds and corals and carbuncles and all manner of precious gems\nand jewels such as the tongue of man could not describe.”",
        "The story teller proceeded, “Then, quoth Prince Azib, now verily am\nI the monarch of the age, since by Allah’s grace this enormous\nwealth is mine; and I have forty damsels under my hand nor is there\nany to claim them save myself.”",
        "The handsome Arab beside Ryder inhaled his pipe luxuriously. “By the\ngrace of Allah!” he said reverently.",
        "“Then I gave not over opening place after place until nine and\nthirty days were passed and in that time I had entered every chamber\nexcept that one whose door I was charged not to open. But my\nthoughts ever ran upon that forbidden fortieth and Satan urged me to\nopen it for my own undoing....”",
        "“I see his finish,” said Ryder interestedly to himself–and he\nthought of the analogy.",
        "“So I stood before the chamber, and after a few moments’ hesitation,\nopened the door which was plated with red gold and entered. I was\nmet by a perfume whose like I had never before smelt; and so sharp\nand subtle was the odor that it made my senses drunken as with\nstrong wine, and I fell to the ground in a fainting fit which lasted\na full hour. When I came to myself I strengthened my heart, and\nentering found myself in a chamber bespread with saffron and blazing\nwith light.... Presently, I spied a noble steed, black as the murks\nof night when murkiest, standing ready saddled and bridled (and his\nsaddle was of red gold) before two mangers one of clear crystal\nwherein was husked sesame, and the other, also of crystal containing\nwater of the rose scented with musk. When I saw this I marveled and\nsaid to myself, ’Doubtless in this animal must be some wondrous\nmystery, and Satan–’”",
        "“Satan the Stoned!” murmured Ryder’s neighbor religiously.",
        "“Satan cozened me, so I led him without and mounted him ... and\nstruck him withal. When he felt the blow he neighed a neigh with a\nsound like deafening thunder and opening a pair of wings flew up\nwith me in the firmament of heaven far beyond the eyesight of man.\nAfter a full hour of flight he descended and shaking me off his back\nlashed me on the face with his tail, and gouged out my left eye,\ncausing it to roll along my cheek. Then he flew away.”",
        "On rolled the voice, narrating the prince’s descent to the table of\nthe other one-eyed youths, but Ryder was unheeding. And at the close\nhe inclined his head with the other listeners, murmuring “May Allah\nincrease thy prosperity,” as he felt in his pockets for the silver\nwhich the others were drawing from turban and sleeves and sash to\nlay in the patriarch’s lap, and then raised his head to question\ndiffidently, “Would you interpret, O Khazib, the meaning of that\ndoor? For I hear that it hath now become a saying of a forbidden\nthing.”",
        "The sage hesitated, sucking at his pipe. Then he said slowly, “To\nevery man, O Youth, is there a forbidden door, beyond which waits\nthe steed of high adventure ... with wings beyond man’s riding. And\nso the rider is lost and his vision is gone.”",
        "“But for him who could ride?” Ryder suggested.",
        "“Inshallah! Who can say till he has tried his destiny–and better\nare the nine and thirty chambers of safe pleasance than the lonely\nsightlessness of the outcast one.... It is a tale which if it were\nwritten upon the eye-corners with needle-gravers, were a warning to\nthose who would be warned.”",
        "For a moment their eyes held each other, smiling but grave. Ryder’s\nthoughts were of the morrow, of that forbidden entry he was planning\nto make, of the risks, the wild uncertainties....",
        "Wisdom and counsel looked significantly out at him out of those\npatriarchal eyes. Prudence and sanity clamored within him for a\nhearing.",
        "And then he smiled, the whimsical, boyish smile of young\nadventuring.",
        "“But whoever, O, my father, had opened that forbidden door\nthe veriest crack, and breathed its scent and glimpsed its\ndazzlement–then for him there is no turning back,” he confided.",
        "He rose and Khazib’s eyes followed him.",
        "“Luck go with you, my son,” he said clearly, “in Allah’s name,” and\nsmiling in faint ruefulness, “May Allah heed thee!” Ryder murmured\npiously.",
