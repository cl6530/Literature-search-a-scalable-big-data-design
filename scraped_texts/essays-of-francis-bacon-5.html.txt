Francis Bacon (1561-1626)




REVENGE is a kind of wild justice; which the
more man’ s nature runs to, the more ought
law to weed it out.  For as for the first wrong, it
doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that
wrong, putteth the law out of office.  Certainly, in
taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy;
but in passing it over, he is superior; for it is a
prince’s part to pardon.  And Solomon, I am sure,
saith, It is the glory of a man, to pass by an offence.
That which is past is gone, and irrevocable; and
wise men have enough to do, with things present
and to come; therefore they do but trifle with
themselves, that labor in past matters.  There is no
man doth a wrong, for the wrong’s sake; but
thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or
honor, or the like.  Therefore why should I be
angry with a man, for loving himself better than
me? And if any man should do wrong, merely out
of ill-nature, why, yet it is but like the thorn or
briar, which prick and scratch, because they can
do no other.  The most tolerable sort of revenge, is
for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy;
but then let a man take heed, the revenge be such
as there is no law to punish; else a man’s enemy is
still before hand, and it is two for one.  Some, when
they take revenge, are desirous, the party should
know, whence it cometh.  This is the more generous.  For the delight seemeth to be, not so much in
doing the hurt, as in making the party repent.  But
base and crafty cowards, are like the arrow that
flieth in the dark.  Cosmus, duke of Florence, had a
desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting
friends, as if those wrongs were unpardonable;
You shall read (saith he) that we are commanded
to forgive our enemies; but you never read, that we
are commanded to forgive our friends.  But yet the
spirit of Job was in a better tune: Shall we (saith
he) take good at God’s hands, and not be content to
take evil also? And so of friends in a proportion.
This is certain, that a man that studieth revenge,
keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise
would heal, and do well.  Public revenges are for
the most part fortunate; as that for the death of
Caesar; for the death of Pertinax; for the death of
Henry the Third of France; and many more.  But
in private revenges, it is not so.  Nay rather, vindictive persons live the life of witches; who, as they
are mischievous, so end they infortunate.
