Jack Valenti has been the president of the Motion Picture Association of America 
since 1966. He first came to Washington, D.C., with Lyndon Johnson’s 
administrationliterally. The famous picture of Johnson’s swearing-in on Air 
Force One after the assassination of President Kennedy has Valenti in the 
background. In his almost forty years of running the MPAA, Valenti has 
established himself as perhaps the most prominent and effective lobbyist in 
Washington.
The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion Picture Association. 
It was formed in 1922 as a trade association whose goal was to defend American 
movies against increasing domestic criticism. The organization now represents 
not only filmmakers but producers and distributors of entertainment for 
television, video, and cable. Its board is made up of the chairmen and 
presidents of the seven major producers and distributors of motion picture and 
television programs in the United States: Walt Disney, Sony Pictures 
Entertainment, MGM, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal 
Studios, and Warner Brothers.
Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president before him has had 
as much influence over that organization, or over Washington. As a Texan, 
Valenti has mastered the single most important political skill of a Southerner
the ability to appear simple and slow while hiding a lightning-fast intellect. 
To this day, Valenti plays the simple, humble man. But this Harvard MBA, and 
author of four books, who finished high school at the age of fifteen and flew 
more than fifty combat missions in World War II, is no Mr. Smith. When Valenti 
went to Washington, he mastered the city in a quintessentially Washingtonian 
way.
In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our culture depends 
upon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting the MPAA rating system, it 
has probably avoided a great deal of speech-regulating harm. But there is an 
aspect to the organization’s mission that is both the most radical and the most 
important. This is the organization’s effort, epitomized in Valenti’s every act, 
to redefine the meaning of creative property.
In 1982, Valenti’s testimony to Congress captured the strategy perfectly:
No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges and the counter-
charges, no matter the tumult and the shouting, reasonable men and women will 
keep returning to the fundamental issue, the central theme which animates this 
entire debate: Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and 
protection resident in all other property owners in the nation. That is the 
issue. That is the question. And that is the rostrum on which this entire 
hearing and the debates to follow must rest. [1]
The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of Valenti’s rhetoric, 
is brilliant and simple and brilliant because simple. The central theme to 
which reasonable men and women will return is this: Creative property owners 
must be accorded the same rights and protections resident in all other property 
owners in the nation. There are no second-class citizens, Valenti might have 
continued. There should be no second-class property owners.
This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is stated with such 
clarity as to make the idea as obvious as the notion that we use elections to 
pick presidents. But in fact, there is no more extreme a claim made by anyone 
who is serious in this debate than this claim of Valenti’s. Jack Valenti, 
however sweet and however brilliant, is perhaps the nation’s foremost extremist 
when it comes to the nature and scope of creative property. His views have 
/no reasonable connection to our actual legal tradition, even if the subtle 
pull of his Texan charm has slowly redefined that tradition, at least in 
Washington.
While creative property is certainly property in a nerdy and precise sense 
that lawyers are trained to understand, [2] it has never been the case, nor 
should it be, that creative property owners have been ac- corded the same 
rights and protection resident in all other property owners. Indeed, if 
creative property owners were given the same rights as all other property 
owners, that would effect a radical, and radically undesirable, change in our 
tradition.
Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares squat for our 
tradition and the values it represents. He speaks for an industry that is 
instead fighting to restore the tradition that the British overturned in 1710. 
In the world that Valenti’s changes would create, a powerful few would exercise 
powerful control over how our creative culture would develop.
I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince you that, 
historically, Valenti’s claim is absolutely wrong. The second is to convince you 
that it would be terribly wrong for us to reject our history. We have always 
treated rights in creative property differently from the rights resident in all 
other property owners. They have never been the same. And they should never be 
the same, because, however counterintuitive this may seem, to make them the same 
would be to fundamentally weaken the opportunity for new creators to create. 
Creativity depends upon the owners of creativity having less than perfect 
control.
Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most powerful of the 
old guard, have little interest, their rhetoric notwithstanding, in assuring 
that the new can displace them. No organization does. No person does. (Ask me 
about tenure, for example.) But what’s good for the MPAA is not necessarily good 
for America. A society that defends the ideals of free culture must preserve 
precisely the opportunity for new creativity to threaten the old.
To get just a hint that there is something fundamentally wrong in Valenti’s 
argument, we need look no further than the United States Constitution itself.
The framers of our Constitution loved property. Indeed, so strongly did they 
love property that they built into the Constitution an important requirement. If 
the government takes your propertyif it condemns your house, or acquires a 
slice of land from your farmit is required, under the Fifth Amendment’s 
Takings Clause, to pay you just compensation for that taking. The 
Constitution thus guarantees that property is, in a certain sense, sacred. It 
cannot ever be taken from the property owner unless the government pays for 
the privilege.
Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about what Valenti calls 
creative property. In the clause granting Congress the power to create 
creative property, the Constitution requires that after a limited time, 
Congress take back the rights that it has granted and set the creative 
property free to the public domain. Yet when Congress does this, when the 
expiration of a copyright term takes your copyright and turns it over to the 
public domain, Congress does not have any obligation to pay just compensation 
for this taking. Instead, the same Constitution that requires compensation for 
your land requires that you lose your creative property right without any 
compensation at all.
The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of property are 
not to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly to be treated differently. 
Valenti is therefore not just asking for a change in our tradition when he 
argues that creative-property owners should be accorded the same rights as every 
other property-right owner. He is effectively arguing for a change in our 
Constitution itself.
Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily wrong. There was 
much in our original Constitution that was plainly wrong. The Constitution of 
1789 entrenched slavery; it left senators to be appointed rather than elected; 
it made it possible for the electoral college to produce a tie between the 
president and his own vice president (as it did in 1800). The framers were no 
doubt extraordinary, but I would be the first to admit that they made big 
mistakes. We have since rejected some of those mistakes; no doubt there could be 
others that we should reject as well. So my argument is not simply that because 
Jefferson did it, we should, too.
Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should at least try to 
understand why. Why did the framers, fanatical property types that they were, 
reject the claim that creative property be given the same rights as all other 
property? Why did they require that for creative property there must be a public 
domain?
To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the history of these 
creative property rights, and the control that they enabled. Once we see 
clearly how differently these rights have been defined, we will be in a better 
position to ask the question that should be at the core of this war: Not 
/whether creative property should be protected, but how. Not whether we will 
enforce the rights the law gives to creative-property owners, but what the 
particular mix of rights ought to be. Not whether artists should be paid, but 
whether institutions designed to assure that artists get paid need also control 
how culture develops.
To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk about how property 
is protected. More precisely, we need a more general way than the narrow 
language of the law allows. In Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, I used a 
simple model to capture this more general perspective. For any particular right 
or regulation, this model asks how four different modalities of regulation 
interact to support or weaken the right or regulation. I represented it with 
this diagram:
[Image: alt text]
At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual or group that 
is the target of regulation, or the holder of a right. (In each case throughout, 
we can describe this either as regulation or as a right. For simplicity’s sake, 
I will speak only of regulations.) The ovals represent four ways in which the 
individual or group might be regulatedeither constrained or, alternatively, 
enabled. Law is the most obvious constraint (to lawyers, at least). It 
constrains by threatening punishments after the fact if the rules set in advance 
are violated. So if, for example, you willfully infringe Madonna’s copyright by 
copying a song from her latest CD and posting it on the Web, you can be punished 
with a $150,000 fine. The fine is an ex post punishment for violating an ex ante 
rule. It is imposed by the state.
Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an individual for 
violating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is imposed by a community, not 
(or not only) by the state. There may be no law against spitting, but that 
doesn’t mean you won’t be punished if you spit on the ground while standing in 
line at a movie. The punishment might not be harsh, though depending upon the 
community, it could easily be more harsh than many of the punishments imposed by 
the state. The mark of the difference is not the severity of the rule, but the 
source of the enforcement.
The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is effected through 
conditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you’ll be paid M if you do N. These 
constraints are obviously not independent of law or normsit is property law 
that defines what must be bought if it is to be taken legally; it is norms that 
say what is appropriately sold. But given a set of norms, and a background of 
property and contract law, the market imposes a simultaneous constraint upon how 
an individual or group might behave.
Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously, architecturethe 
physical world as one finds itis a constraint on behavior. A fallen bridge 
might constrain your ability to get across a river. Railroad tracks might 
constrain the ability of a community to integrate its social life. As with the 
market, architecture does not effect its constraint through ex post punishments. 
Instead, also as with the market, architecture effects its constraint through 
simultaneous conditions. These conditions are imposed not by courts enforcing 
contracts, or by police punishing theft, but by nature, by architecture. If a 
500-pound boulder blocks your way, it is the law of gravity that enforces this 
constraint. If a $500 airplane ticket stands between you and a flight to New 
York, it is the market that enforces this constraint.
So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is obvious: They 
interact. Restrictions imposed by one might be reinforced by another. Or 
restrictions imposed by one might be undermined by another.
The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the effective 
freedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any particular thing, we have to 
consider how these four modalities interact. Whether or not there are other 
constraints (there may well be; my claim is not about comprehensiveness), these 
four are among the most significant, and any regulator (whether controlling or 
freeing) must consider how these four in particular interact.
So, for example, consider the freedom to drive a car at a high speed. That 
freedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits that say how fast you can 
drive in particular places at particular times. It is in part restricted by 
architecture: speed bumps, for example, slow most rational drivers; governors in 
buses, as another example, set the maximum rate at which the driver can drive. 
The freedom is in part restricted by the market: Fuel efficiency drops as speed 
increases, thus the price of gasoline indirectly constrains speed. And finally, 
the norms of a community may or may not constrain the freedom to speed. Drive at 
50 mph by a school in your own neighborhood and you’re likely to be punished by 
the neighbors. The same norm wouldn’t be as effective in a different town, or at 
night.
The final point about this simple model should also be fairly clear: While these 
four modalities are analytically independent, law has a special role in 
affecting the three. [3] The law, in other words, sometimes operates to increase 
or decrease the constraint of a particular modality. Thus, the law might be used 
to increase taxes on gasoline, so as to increase the incentives to drive more 
slowly. The law might be used to mandate more speed bumps, so as to increase the 
difficulty of driving rapidly. The law might be used to fund ads that stigmatize 
reckless driving. Or the law might be used to require that other laws be more 
stricta federal requirement that states decrease the speed limit, for example
so as to decrease the attractiveness of fast driving.
[Image: alt text.]
These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To understand the 
effective protection of liberty or protection of property at any particular 
moment, we must track these changes over time. A restriction imposed by one 
modality might be erased by another. A freedom enabled by one modality might be 
displaced by another. [4] 
Why Hollywood Is Right
The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or just how, 
Hollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied Congress and the courts 
to defend copyright. This model helps us see why that rallying makes sense.
Let’s say this is the picture of copyright’s regulation before the Internet:
[Image: alt text.]
There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture. The law limits 
the ability to copy and share content, by imposing penalties on those who copy 
and share content. Those penalties are reinforced by technologies that make it 
hard to copy and share content (architecture) and expensive to copy and share 
content (market). Finally, those penalties are mitigated by norms we all 
recognizekids, for example, taping other kids’ records. These uses of 
copyrighted material may well be infringement, but the norms of our society 
(before the Internet, at least) had no problem with this form of infringement.
Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as MP3s and p2p 
sharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes dramatically, as does the 
constraint of the market. And as both the market and architecture relax the 
regulation of copyright, norms pile on. The happy balance (for the warriors, at 
least) of life before the Internet becomes an effective state of anarchy after 
the Internet.
Thus the sense of, and justification for, the warriors’ response. Technology has 
changed, the warriors say, and the effect of this change, when ramified through 
the market and norms, is that a balance of protection for the copyright owners’ 
rights has been lost. This is Iraq after the fall of Saddam, but this time no 
government is justifying the looting that results.
[Image: alt text.]
Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to the warriors. 
Indeed, in a White Paper prepared by the Commerce Department (one heavily 
influenced by the copyright warriors) in 1995, this mix of regulatory modalities 
had already been identified and the strategy to respond already mapped. In 
response to the changes the Internet had effected, the White Paper argued (1) 
Congress should strengthen intellectual property law, (2) businesses should 
adopt innovative marketing techniques, (3) technologists should push to develop 
code to protect copyrighted material, and (4) educators should educate kids to 
better protect copyright.
This mixed strategy is just what copyright neededif it was to preserve the 
particular balance that existed before the change induced by the Internet. And 
it’s just what we should expect the content industry to push for. It is as 
American as apple pie to consider the happy life you have as an entitlement, and 
to look to the law to protect it if something comes along to change that happy 
life. Homeowners living in a flood plain have no hesitation appealing to the 
government to rebuild (and rebuild again) when a flood (architecture) wipes away 
their property (law). Farmers have no hesitation appealing to the government to 
bail them out when a virus (architecture) devastates their crop. Unions have no 
hesitation appealing to the government to bail them out when imports (market) 
wipe out the U.S. steel industry.
Thus, there’s nothing wrong or surprising in the content industry’s campaign to 
protect itself from the harmful consequences of a technological innovation. And 
I would be the last person to argue that the changing technology of the Internet 
has not had a profound effect on the content industry’s way of doing business, 
or as John Seely Brown describes it, its architecture of revenue.
But just because a particular interest asks for government support, it doesn’t 
follow that support should be granted. And just because technology has weakened 
a particular way of doing business, it doesn’t follow that the government should 
intervene to support that old way of doing business. Kodak, for example, has 
lost perhaps as much as 20 percent of their traditional film market to the 
emerging technologies of digital cameras. [5] Does anyone believe the government 
should ban digital cameras just to support Kodak? Highways have weakened the 
freight business for railroads. Does anyone think we should ban trucks from 
roads for the purpose of protecting the railroads? Closer to the subject of 
this book, remote channel changers have weakened the stickiness of television 
advertising (if a boring commercial comes on the TV, the remote makes it easy to 
surf ), and it may well be that this change has weakened the television 
advertising market. But does anyone believe we should regulate remotes to 
reinforce commercial television? (Maybe by limiting them to function only once a 
second, or to switch to only ten channels within an hour?)
The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is no. In a free 
society, with a free market, supported by free enterprise and free trade, the 
government’s role is not to support one way of doing business against others. 
Its role is not to pick winners and protect them against loss. If the government 
did this generally, then we would never have any progress. As Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates wrote in 1991, in a memo criticizing software patents, established 
companies have an interest in excluding future competitors. [6] And relative to 
a startup, established companies also have the means. (Think RCA and FM radio.) 
A world in which competitors with new ideas must fight not only the market but 
also the government is a world in which competitors with new ideas will not 
succeed. It is a world of stasis and increasingly concentrated stagnation. It is 
the Soviet Union under Brezhnev.
Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with new technologies 
that change the way they do business to look to the government for protection, 
it is the special duty of policy makers to guarantee that that protection not 
become a deterrent to progress. It is the duty of policy makers, in other words, 
to assure that the changes they create, in response to the request of those hurt 
by changing technology, are changes that preserve the incentives and 
opportunities for innovation and change.
In the context of laws regulating speechwhich include, obviously, copyright 
lawthat duty is even stronger. When the industry complaining about changing 
technologies is asking Congress to respond in a way that burdens speech and 
creativity, policy makers should be especially wary of the request. It is always 
a bad deal for the government to get into the business of regulating speech 
markets. The risks and dangers of that game are precisely why our framers 
created the First Amendment to our Constitution: Congress shall make no law ... 
abridging the freedom of speech. So when Congress is being asked to pass laws 
that would abridge the freedom of speech, it should ask carefullywhether 
such regulation is justified.
My argument just now, however, has nothing to do with whether the changes that 
are being pushed by the copyright warriors are justified. My argument is about 
their effect. For before we get to the question of justification, a hard 
question that depends a great deal upon your values, we should first ask whether 
we understand the effect of the changes the content industry wants.
Here’s the metaphor that will capture the argument to follow.
In 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss chemist Paul 
Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize for his work demonstrating the insecticidal 
properties of DDT. By the 1950s, the insecticide was widely used around the 
world to kill disease-carrying pests. It was also used to increase farm 
production.
No one doubts that killing disease-carrying pests or increasing crop production 
is a good thing. No one doubts that the work of Müller was important and 
valuable and probably saved lives, possibly millions.
But in 1962, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, which argued that DDT, 
whatever its primary benefits, was also having unintended environmental 
consequences. Birds were losing the ability to reproduce. Whole chains of the 
ecology were being destroyed.
No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul Müller certainly did not aim to 
harm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of problems produced another set 
which, in the view of some, was far worse than the problems that were originally 
attacked. Or more accurately, the problems DDT caused were worse than the 
problems it solved, at least when considering the other, more environmentally 
friendly ways to solve the problems that DDT was meant to solve.
It is to this image precisely that Duke University law professor James Boyle 
appeals when he argues that we need an environmentalism” for culture. [7] His 
point, and the point I want to develop in the balance of this chapter, is not 
that the aims of copyright are flawed. Or that authors should not be paid for 
their work. Or that music should be given away for free. The point is that 
some of the ways in which we might protect authors will have unintended 
consequences for the cultural environment, much like DDT had for the natural 
environment. And just as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement of malaria or an 
attack on farmers, so, too, is criticism of one particular set of regulations 
protecting copyright not an endorsement of anarchy or an attack on authors. It 
is an environment of creativity that we seek, and we should be aware of our 
actions’ effects on the environment.
My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map exactly this effect. 
No doubt the technology of the Internet has had a dramatic effect on the ability 
of copyright owners to protect their content. But there should also be little 
doubt that when you add together the changes in copyright law over time, plus 
the change in technology that the Internet is undergoing just now, the net 
effect of these changes will not be only that copyrighted work is effectively 
protected. Also, and generally missed, the net effect of this massive increase 
in protection will be devastating to the environment for creativity.
In a line: To kill a gnat, we are spraying DDT with consequences for free 
culture that will be far more devastating than that this gnat will be lost.
Beginnings
America copied English copyright law. Actually, we copied and improved English 
copyright law. Our Constitution makes the purpose of creative property rights 
clear; its express limitations reinforce the English aim to avoid overly 
powerful publishers.
The power to establish creative property rights is granted to Congress in a 
way that, for our Constitution, at least, is very odd. Article I, section 8, 
clause 8 of our Constitution states that:
Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by 
securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their 
respective Writings and Discoveries.
We can call this the Progress Clause, for notice what this clause does not 
say. It does not say Congress has the power to grant creative property rights. 
It says that Congress has the power to promote progress. The grant of power is 
its purpose, and its purpose is a public one, not the purpose of enriching 
publishers, nor even primarily the purpose of rewarding authors.
The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As we saw in 
chapter 6, the English limited the term of copyright so as to assure that a few 
would not exercise disproportionate control over culture by exercising 
disproportionate control over publishing. We can assume the framers followed the 
English for a similar purpose. Indeed, unlike the English, the framers 
reinforced that objective, by requiring that copyrights extend to Authors 
only.
The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the Constitution’s 
design in general. To avoid a problem, the framers built structure. To prevent 
the concentrated power of publishers, they built a structure that kept 
copyrights away from publishers and kept them short. To prevent the concentrated 
power of a church, they banned the federal government from establishing a 
church. To prevent concentrating power in the federal government, they built 
structures to reinforce the power of the statesincluding the Senate, whose 
members were at the time selected by the states, and an electoral college, also 
selected by the states, to select the president. In each case, a structure 
built checks and balances into the constitutional frame, structured to prevent 
otherwise inevitable concentrations of power.
I doubt the framers would recognize the regulation we call copyright today. 
The scope of that regulation is far beyond anything they ever considered. To 
begin to understand what they did, we need to put our copyright in context: We 
need to see how it has changed in the 210 years since they first struck its 
design.
Some of these changes come from the law: some in light of changes in technology, 
and some in light of changes in technology given a particular concentration of 
market power. In terms of our model, we started here:
[Image: alt text.]
We will end here:
[Image: alt text.]
Let me explain how.
When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative property, it faced the 
same uncertainty about the status of creative property that the English had 
confronted in 1774. Many states had passed laws protecting creative property, 
and some believed that these laws simply supplemented common law rights that 
already protected creative authorship. [8] This meant that there was no 
guaranteed public domain in the United States in 1790. If copyrights were 
protected by the common law, then there was no simple way to know whether a work 
published in the United States was controlled or free. Just as in England, this 
lingering uncertainty would make it hard for publishers to rely upon a public 
domain to reprint and distribute works.
That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation granting copyrights. 
Because federal law overrides any contrary state law, federal protections for 
copyrighted works displaced any state law protections. Just as in England the 
Statute of Anne eventually meant that the copyrights for all English works 
expired, a federal statute meant that any state copyrights expired as well.
In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a federal 
copyright and secured that copyright for fourteen years. If the author was alive 
at the end of that fourteen years, then he could opt to renew the copyright for 
another fourteen years. If he did not renew the copyright, his work passed into 
the public domain.
While there were many works created in the United States in the first ten years 
of the Republic, only 5 percent of the works were actually registered under the 
federal copyright regime. Of all the work created in the United States both 
before 1790 and from 1790 through 1800, 95 percent immediately passed into the 
public domain; the balance would pass into the pubic domain within twenty-eight 
years at most, and more likely within fourteen years. [9]
This system of renewal was a crucial part of the American system of copyright. 
It assured that the maximum terms of copyright would be granted only for works 
where they were wanted. After the initial term of fourteen years, if it wasn’t 
worth it to an author to renew his copyright, then it wasn’t worth it to society 
to insist on the copyright, either.
Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast majority of copyright 
owners at that time, it was long enough: Only a small minority of them renewed 
their copyright after fourteen years; the balance allowed their work to pass 
into the public domain. [10]
Even today, this structure would make sense. Most creative work has an actual 
commercial life of just a couple of years. Most books fall out of print after 
one year. [11] When that happens, the used books are traded free of copyright 
regulation. Thus the books are no longer effectively controlled by copyright. 
The only practical commercial use of the books at that time is to sell the books 
as used books; that usebecause it does not involve publicationis effectively 
free.
In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of copyright was changed 
once. In 1831, the term was increased from a maximum of 28 years to a maximum of 
42 by increasing the initial term of copyright from 14 years to 28 years. In the 
next fifty years of the Republic, the term increased once again. In 1909, 
Congress extended the renewal term of 14 years to 28 years, setting a maximum 
term of 56 years.
Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has defined copyright 
law since. Eleven times in the last forty years, Congress has extended the terms 
of existing copyrights; twice in those forty years, Congress extended the term 
of future copyrights. Initially, the extensions of existing copyrights were 
short, a mere one to two years. In 1976, Congress extended all existing 
copyrights by nineteen years. And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term 
Extension Act, Congress extended the term of existing and future copyrights by 
twenty years.
The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the passing of works 
into the public domain. This latest extension means that the public domain will 
have been tolled for thirty-nine out of fifty-five years, or 70 percent of the 
time since 1962. Thus, in the twenty years after the Sonny Bono Act, while one 
million patents will pass into the public domain, zero copyrights will pass into 
the public domain by virtue of the expiration of a copyright term.
The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another, little-noticed 
change in the copyright law. Remember I said that the framers established a two-
part copyright regime, requiring a copyright owner to renew his copyright after 
an initial term. The requirement of renewal meant that works that no longer 
needed copyright protection would pass more quickly into the public domain. The 
works remaining under protection would be those that had some continuing 
commercial value.
The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For all works created 
after 1978, there was only one copyright termthe maximum term. For natural 
authors, that term was life plus fifty years. For corporations, the term was 
seventy-five years. Then, in 1992, Congress abandoned the renewal requirement 
for all works created before 1978. All works still under copyright would be 
accorded the maximum term then available. After the Sonny Bono Act, that term 
was ninety-five years.
This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic way to assure 
that works that were no longer exploited passed into the public domain. And 
indeed, after these changes, it is unclear whether it is even possible to put 
works into the public domain. The public domain is orphaned by these changes in 
copyright law. Despite the requirement that terms be limited, we have no 
evidence that anything will limit them.
The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright is dramatic. In 
1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners failed to renew their copyright. 
That meant that the average term of copyright in 1973 was just 32.2 years. 
Because of the elimination of the renewal requirement, the average term of 
copyright is now the maximum term. In thirty years, then, the average term has 
tripled, from 32.2 years to 95 years. [12]
Law: Scope
The scope of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the law. The scope 
of American copyright has changed dramatically. Those changes are not 
necessarily bad. But we should understand the extent of the changes if we’re to 
keep this debate in context.
In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only maps, charts, and 
books. That means it didn’t cover, for example, music or architecture. More 
significantly, the right granted by a copyright gave the author the exclusive 
right to publish copyrighted works. That means someone else violated the 
copyright only if he republished the work without the copyright owner’s 
permission. Finally, the right granted by a copyright was an exclusive right to 
that particular book. The right did not extend to what lawyers call derivative 
works. It would not, therefore, interfere with the right of someone other than 
the author to translate a copyrighted book, or to adapt the story to a different 
form (such as a drama based on a published book).
This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of copyright today are 
extremely hard to describe simply, in general terms, the right covers 
practically any creative work that is reduced to a tangible form. It covers 
music as well as architecture, drama as well as computer programs. It gives the 
copyright owner of that creative work not only the exclusive right to publish 
the work, but also the exclusive right of control over any copies of that 
work. And most significant for our purposes here, the right gives the copyright 
owner control over not only his or her particular work, but also any derivative 
work that might grow out of the original work. In this way, the right covers 
more creative work, protects the creative work more broadly, and protects works 
that are based in a significant way on the initial creative work.
At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded, procedural 
limitations on the right have been relaxed. I’ve already described the complete 
removal of the renewal requirement in 1992. In addition to the renewal 
requirement, for most of the history of American copyright law, there was a 
requirement that a work be registered before it could receive the protection of 
a copyright. There was also a requirement that any copyrighted work be marked 
either with that famous © or the word copyright. And for most of the history 
of American copyright law, there was a requirement that works be deposited with 
the government before a copyright could be secured.
The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible understanding that 
for most works, no copyright was required. Again, in the first ten years of the 
Republic, 95 percent of works eligible for copyright were never copyrighted. 
Thus, the rule reflected the norm: Most works apparently didn’t need copyright, 
so registration narrowed the regulation of the law to the few that did. The same 
reasoning justified the requirement that a work be marked as copyrightedthat 
way it was easy to know whether a copyright was being claimed. The requirement 
that works be deposited was to assure that after the copyright expired, there 
would be a copy of the work somewhere so that it could be copied by others 
without locating the original author.
All of these formalities were abolished in the American system when we decided 
to follow European copyright law. There is no requirement that you register a 
work to get a copyright; the copyright now is automatic; the copyright exists 
whether or not you mark your work with a ©; and the copyright exists whether or 
not you actually make a copy available for others to copy.
Consider a practical example to understand the scope of these differences.
If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent who actually 
copyrighted that book, then the copyright law protected you against another 
publisher’s taking your book and republishing it without your permission. The 
aim of the act was to regulate publishers so as to prevent that kind of unfair 
competition. In 1790, there were 174 publishers in the United States. [13] The 
Copyright Act was thus a tiny regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of 
the creative market in the United Statespublishers.
The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied your poem by hand, 
over and over again, as a way to learn it by heart, my act was totally 
unregulated by the 1790 act. If I took your novel and made a play based upon it, 
or if I translated it or abridged it, none of those activities were regulated by 
the original copyright act. These creative activities remained free, while the 
activities of publishers were restrained.
Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your book is 
automatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every e-mail, every note to 
your spouse, every doodle, every creative act that’s reduced to a tangible 
formall of this is automatically copyrighted. There is no need to register or 
mark your work. The protection follows the creation, not the steps you take to 
protect it.
That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range of fair use 
exceptions) to control how others copy the work, whether they copy it to 
republish it or to share an excerpt.
That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would control competing 
publishing. But there’s a second part to the copyright of today that is not at 
all obvious. This is the protection of derivative rights. If you write a book, 
no one can make a movie out of your book without permission. No one can 
translate it without permission. CliffsNotes can’t make an abridgment unless 
permission is granted. All of these derivative uses of your original work are 
controlled by the copyright holder. The copyright, in other words, is now not 
just an exclusive right to your writings, but an exclusive right to your 
writings and a large proportion of the writings inspired by them.
It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our framers, though 
it has become second nature to us. Initially, this expansion was created to deal 
with obvious evasions of a narrower copyright. If I write a book, can you change 
one word and then claim a copyright in a new and different book? Obviously that 
would make a joke of the copyright, so the law was properly expanded to include 
those slight modifications as well as the verbatim original work.
In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power within a free 
cultureat least, it’s astonishing when you understand that the law applies not 
just to the commercial publisher but to anyone with a computer. I understand the 
wrong in duplicating and selling someone else’s work. But whatever that wrong 
is, transforming someone else’s work is a different wrong. Some view 
transformation as no wrong at allthey believe that our law, as the framers 
penned it, should not protect derivative rights at all. [14] Whether or not you 
go that far, it seems plain that whatever wrong is involved is fundamentally 
different from the wrong of direct piracy.
Yet copyright law treats these two different wrongs in the same way. I can go to 
court and get an injunction against your pirating my book. I can go to court and 
get an injunction against your transformative use of my book. [15] These two 
different uses of my creative work are treated the same.
This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why should you be able 
to write a movie that takes my story and makes money from it without paying me 
or crediting me? Or if Disney creates a creature called Mickey Mouse, why 
should you be able to make Mickey Mouse toys and be the one to trade on the 
value that Disney originally created?
These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that the derivative 
right is unjustified. My aim just now is much narrower: simply to make clear 
that this expansion is a significant change from the rights originally granted.
Law and Architecture: Reach
Whereas originally the law regulated only publishers, the change in copyright’s 
scope means that the law today regulates publishers, users, and authors. It 
regulates them because all three are capable of making copies, and the core of 
the regulation of copyright law is copies. [16]
Copies. That certainly sounds like the obvious thing for copy/right law to 
regulate. But as with Jack Valenti’s argument at the start of this chapter, that 
creative property deserves the same rights as all other property, it is the 
/obvious that we need to be most careful about. For while it may be obvious 
that in the world before the Internet, copies were the obvious trigger for 
copyright law, upon reflection, it should be obvious that in the world with the 
Internet, copies should not be the trigger for copyright law. More precisely, 
they should not always be the trigger for copyright law.
This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take this very slowly 
so that the point is not easily missed. My claim is that the Internet should at 
least force us to rethink the conditions under which the law of copyright 
automatically applies, [17] because it is clear that the current reach of 
copyright was never contemplated, much less chosen, by the legislators who 
enacted copyright law.
We can see this point abstractly by beginning with this largely empty circle.
[Image: large circle containing the word uses’.]
Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to represent all its 
potential uses. Most of these uses are unregulated by copyright law, because 
the uses don’t create a copy. If you read a book, that act is not regulated by 
copyright law. If you give someone the book, that act is not regulated by 
copyright law. If you resell a book, that act is not regulated (copyright law 
expressly states that after the first sale of a book, the copyright owner can 
impose no further conditions on the disposition of the book). If you sleep on 
the book or use it to hold up a lamp or let your puppy chew it up, those acts 
are not regulated by copyright law, because those acts do not make a copy.
[Image: alt text.]
Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are regulated by copyright 
law. Republishing the book, for example, makes a copy. It is therefore regulated 
by copyright law. Indeed, this particular use stands at the core of this circle 
of possible uses of a copyrighted work. It is the paradigmatic use properly 
regulated by copyright regulation (see first diagram on next page).
[Image: alt text.]
Finally, there is a tiny sliver of otherwise regulated copying uses that remain 
unregulated because the law considers these fair uses.  These are uses that 
themselves involve copying, but which the law treats as unregulated because 
public policy demands that they remain unregulated. You are free to quote from 
this book, even in a review that is quite negative, without my permission, even 
though that quoting makes a copy. That copy would ordinarily give the copyright 
owner the exclusive right to say whether the copy is allowed or not, but the law 
denies the owner any exclusive right over such fair uses for public policy 
(and possibly First Amendment) reasons.
[image: alt text.]
[image: alt text.]
In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided into three sorts: 
(1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3) regulated uses that are 
nonetheless deemed fair regardless of the copyright owner’s views.
Enter the Interneta distributed, digital network where every use of a 
copyrighted work produces a copy. [18] And because of this single, arbitrary 
feature of the design of a digital network, the scope of category 1 changes 
dramatically. Uses that before were presumptively unregulated are now 
presumptively regulated. No longer is there a set of presumptively unregulated 
uses that define a freedom associated with a copyrighted work. Instead, each use 
is now subject to the copyright, because each use also makes a copycategory 1 
gets sucked into category 2. And those who would defend the unregulated uses of 
copyrighted work must look exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to bear the 
burden of this shift.
So let’s be very specific to make this general point clear. Before the Internet, 
if you purchased a book and read it ten times, there would be no plausible 
/copyright/-related argument that the copyright owner could make to control that 
use of her book. Copyright law would have nothing to say about whether you read 
the book once, ten times, or every night before you went to bed. None of those 
instances of usereadingcould be regulated by copyright law because none of 
those uses produced a copy.
But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a different set of 
rules. Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book only once or only 
once a month, then copyright law would aid the copyright owner in exercising 
this degree of control, because of the accidental feature of copyright law that 
triggers its application upon there being a copy. Now if you read the book ten 
times and the license says you may read it only five times, then whenever you 
read the book (or any portion of it) beyond the fifth time, you are making a 
copy of the book contrary to the copyright owner’s wish.
There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim just now is not 
to argue about whether it makes sense or not. My aim is only to make clear the 
change. Once you see this point, a few other points also become clear:
First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker ever 
intended. Congress did not think through the collapse of the presumptively 
unregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is no evidence at all that policy 
makers had this idea in mind when they allowed our policy here to shift. 
Unregulated uses were an important part of free culture before the Internet.
Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of transformative uses 
of creative content. Again, we can all understand the wrong in commercial 
piracy. But the law now purports to regulate any transformation you make of 
creative work using a machine. Copy and paste and cut and paste become 
crimes. Tinkering with a story and releasing it to others exposes the tinkerer 
to at least a requirement of justification. However troubling the expansion with 
respect to copying a particular work, it is extraordinarily troubling with 
respect to transformative uses of creative work.
Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary burden on 
category 3 (fair use”) that fair use never before had to bear. If a copyright 
owner now tried to control how many times I could read a book on-line, the 
natural response would be to argue that this is a violation of my fair use 
rights. But there has never been any litigation about whether I have a fair use 
right to read, because before the Internet, reading did not trigger the 
application of copyright law and hence the need for a fair use defense. The 
right to read was effectively protected before because reading was not 
regulated.
This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates for free 
culture. We have been cornered into arguing that our rights depend upon fair 
usenever even addressing the earlier question about the expansion in effective 
regulation. A thin protection grounded in fair use makes sense when the vast 
majority of uses are unregulated. But when everything becomes presumptively 
regulated, then the protections of fair use are not enough.
The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was in the business 
of making trailer advertisements for movies available to video stores. The 
video stores displayed the trailers as a way to sell videos. Video Pipeline got 
the trailers from the film distributors, put the trailers on tape, and sold the 
tapes to the retail stores.
The company did this for about fifteen years. Then, in 1997, it began to think 
about the Internet as another way to distribute these previews. The idea was to 
expand their selling by sampling technique by giving on-line stores the same 
ability to enable browsing. Just as in a bookstore you can read a few pages of 
a book before you buy the book, so, too, you would be able to sample a bit from 
the movie on-line before you bought it.
In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film distributors that it 
intended to distribute the trailers through the Internet (rather than sending 
the tapes) to distributors of their videos. Two years later, Disney told Video 
Pipeline to stop. The owner of Video Pipeline asked Disney to talk about the 
matterhe had built a business on distributing this content as a way to help 
sell Disney films; he had customers who depended upon his delivering this 
content. Disney would agree to talk only if Video Pipeline stopped the 
distribution immediately. Video Pipeline thought it was within their fair use” 
rights to distribute the clips as they had. So they filed a lawsuit to ask the 
court to declare that these rights were in fact their rights.
Disney countersuedfor $100 million in damages. Those damages were predicated 
upon a claim that Video Pipeline had willfully infringed” on Disney’s 
copyright. When a court makes a finding of willful infringement, it can award 
damages not on the basis of the actual harm to the copyright owner, but on the 
basis of an amount set in the statute. Because Video Pipeline had distributed 
seven hundred clips of Disney movies to enable video stores to sell copies of 
those movies, Disney was now suing Video Pipeline for $100 million.
Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the video stores 
that were selling Disney’s films also had some sort of right to be able to sell 
the films that they had bought from Disney. Disney’s claim in court was that the 
stores were allowed to sell the films and they were permitted to list the titles 
of the films they were selling, but they were not allowed to show clips of the 
films as a way of selling them without Disney’s permission.
Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the courts would consider 
it a close case. My point here is to map the change that gives Disney this 
power. Before the Internet, Disney couldn’t really control how people got access 
to their content. Once a video was in the marketplace, the first-sale doctrine 
would free the seller to use the video as he wished, including showing portions 
of it in order to engender sales of the entire movie video. But with the 
Internet, it becomes possible for Disney to centralize control over access to 
this content. Because each use of the Internet produces a copy, use on the 
Internet becomes subject to the copyright owner’s control. The technology 
expands the scope of effective control, because the technology builds a copy 
into every transaction.
No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential for control is 
not yet the abuse of control. Barnes & Noble has the right to say you can’t 
touch a book in their store; property law gives them that right. But the market 
effectively protects against that abuse. If Barnes & Noble banned browsing, then 
consumers would choose other bookstores. Competition protects against the 
extremes. And it may well be (my argument so far does not even question this) 
that competition would prevent any similar danger when it comes to copyright. 
Sure, publishers exercising the rights that authors have assigned to them might 
try to regulate how many times you read a book, or try to stop you from sharing 
the book with anyone. But in a competitive market such as the book market, the 
dangers of this happening are quite slight.
Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this changed architecture 
enables. Enabling technology to enforce the control of copyright means that the 
control of copyright is no longer defined by balanced policy. The control of 
copyright is simply what private owners choose. In some contexts, at least, that 
fact is harmless. But in some contexts it is a recipe for disaster.
Architecture and Law: Force
The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough, but a second 
important change brought about by the Internet magnifies its significance. This 
second change does not affect the reach of copyright regulation; it affects how 
such regulation is enforced.
In the world before digital technology, it was generally the law that controlled 
whether and how someone was regulated by copyright law. The law, meaning a 
court, meaning a judge: In the end, it was a human, trained in the tradition of 
the law and cognizant of the balances that tradition embraced, who said whether 
and how the law would restrict your freedom.
There’s a famous story about a battle between the Marx Brothers and Warner 
Brothers. The Marxes intended to make a parody of Casablanca. Warner Brothers 
objected. They wrote a nasty letter to the Marxes, warning them that there would 
be serious legal consequences if they went forward with their plan. [19]
This led the Marx Brothers to respond in kind. They warned Warner Brothers that 
the Marx Brothers were brothers long before you were. [20] The Marx Brothers 
therefore owned the word brothers, and if Warner Brothers insisted on trying 
to control Casablanca, then the Marx Brothers would insist on control over 
/brothers.
An absurd and hollow threat, of course, because Warner Brothers, like the Marx 
Brothers, knew that no court would ever enforce such a silly claim. This 
extremism was irrelevant to the real freedoms anyone (including Warner Brothers) 
enjoyed.
On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules, because on the 
Internet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a human but by a machine: 
Increasingly, the rules of copyright law, as interpreted by the copyright owner, 
get built into the technology that delivers copyrighted content. It is code, 
rather than law, that rules. And the problem with code regulations is that, 
unlike law, code has no shame. Code would not get the humor of the Marx 
Brothers. The consequence of that is not at all funny.
Consider the life of my Adobe eBook Reader.
An e-book is a book delivered in electronic form. An Adobe eBook is not a book 
that Adobe has published; Adobe simply produces the software that publishers use 
to deliver e-books. It provides the technology, and the publisher delivers the 
content by using the technology.
On the next page is a picture of an old version of my Adobe eBook Reader.
As you can see, I have a small collection of e-books within this e-book library. 
Some of these books reproduce content that is in the public domain: 
/Middlemarch, for example, is in the public domain. Some of them reproduce 
content that is not in the public domain: My own book The Future of Ideas is 
not yet within the public domain.
[image: alt text.]
Consider Middlemarch first. If you click on my e-book copy of Middlemarch, 
you’ll see a fancy cover, and then a button at the bottom called Permissions.
If you click on the Permissions button, you’ll see a list of the permissions 
that the publisher purports to grant with this book.
[image]
According to my eBook Reader, I have the permission to copy to the clipboard of 
the computer ten text selections every ten days. (So far, I’ve copied no text to 
the clipboard.) I also have the permission to print ten pages from the book 
every ten days. Lastly, I have the permission to use the Read Aloud button to 
hear Middlemarch read aloud through the computer.
[image]
Here’s the e-book for another work in the public domain (including the 
translation): Aristotle’s Politics.
According to its permissions, no printing or copying is permitted at all. But 
fortunately, you can use the Read Aloud button to hear the book.
[image]
Finally (and most embarrassingly), here are the permissions for the original e-
book version of my last book, The Future of Ideas:
[image]
No copying, no printing, and don’t you dare try to listen to this book!
Now, the Adobe eBook Reader calls these controls permissionsas if the 
publisher has the power to control how you use these works. For works under 
copyright, the copyright owner certainly does have the powerup to the limits of 
the copyright law. But for work not under copyright, there is no such copyright 
power. [21] When my e-book of Middlemarch says I have the permission to copy 
only ten text selections into the memory every ten days, what that really means 
is that the eBook Reader has enabled the publisher to control how I use the book 
on my computer, far beyond the control that the law would enable.
The control comes instead from the codefrom the technology within which the e-
book lives. Though the e-book says that these are permissions, they are not 
the sort of permissions that most of us deal with. When a teenager gets 
permission to stay out till midnight, she knows (unless she’s Cinderella) that 
she can stay out till 2 A.M., but will suffer a punishment if she’s caught. But 
when the Adobe eBook Reader says I have the permission to make ten copies of the 
text into the computer’s memory, that means that after I’ve made ten copies, the 
computer will not make any more. The same with the printing restrictions: After 
ten pages, the eBook Reader will not print any more pages. It’s the same with 
the silly restriction that says that you can’t use the Read Aloud button to read 
my book aloudit’s not that the company will sue you if you do; instead, if you 
push the Read Aloud button with my book, the machine simply won’t read aloud.
These are controls, not permissions. Imagine a world where the Marx Brothers 
sold word processing software that, when you tried to type Warner Brothers, 
erased Brothers from the sentence.
This is the future of copyright law: not so much copyright law as copyright 
code. The controls over access to content will not be controls that are 
ratified by courts; the controls over access to content will be controls that 
are coded by programmers. And whereas the controls that are built into the law 
are always to be checked by a judge, the controls that are built into the 
technology have no similar built-in check.
How significant is this? Isn’t it always possible to get around the controls 
built into the technology? Software used to be sold with technologies that 
limited the ability of users to copy the software, but those were trivial 
protections to defeat. Why won’t it be trivial to defeat these protections as 
well?
We’ve only scratched the surface of this story. Return to the Adobe eBook 
Reader.
Early in the life of the Adobe eBook Reader, Adobe suffered a public relations 
nightmare. Among the books that you could download for free on the Adobe site 
was a copy of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. This wonderful book is in the 
public domain. Yet when you clicked on Permissions for that book, you got the 
following report:
[image]
Here was a public domain children’s book that you were not allowed to copy, not 
allowed to lend, not allowed to give, and, as the permissions indicated, not 
allowed to read aloud!
The public relations nightmare attached to that final permission. For the text 
did not say that you were not permitted to use the Read Aloud button; it said 
you did not have the permission to read the book aloud. That led some people to 
think that Adobe was restricting the right of parents, for example, to read the 
book to their children, which seemed, to say the least, absurd.
Adobe responded quickly that it was absurd to think that it was trying to 
restrict the right to read a book aloud. Obviously it was only restricting the 
ability to use the Read Aloud button to have the book read aloud. But the 
question Adobe never did answer is this: Would Adobe thus agree that a consumer 
was free to use software to hack around the restrictions built into the eBook 
Reader? If some company (call it Elcomsoft) developed a program to disable the 
technological protection built into an Adobe eBook so that a blind person, say, 
could use a computer to read the book aloud, would Adobe agree that such a use 
of an eBook Reader was fair? Adobe didn’t answer because the answer, however 
absurd it might seem, is no.
The point is not to blame Adobe. Indeed, Adobe is among the most innovative 
companies developing strategies to balance open access to content with 
incentives for companies to innovate. But Adobe’s technology enables control, 
and Adobe has an incentive to defend this control. That incentive is 
understandable, yet what it creates is often crazy.
To see the point in a particularly absurd context, consider a favorite story of 
mine that makes the same point.
Consider the robotic dog made by Sony named Aibo. The Aibo learns tricks, 
cuddles, and follows you around. It eats only electricity and that doesn’t leave 
that much of a mess (at least in your house).
The Aibo is expensive and popular. Fans from around the world have set up clubs 
to trade stories. One fan in particular set up a Web site to enable information 
about the Aibo dog to be shared. This fan set up aibopet.com (and aibohack.com, 
but that resolves to the same site), and on that site he provided information 
about how to teach an Aibo to do tricks in addition to the ones Sony had taught 
it.
Teach here has a special meaning. Aibos are just cute computers. You teach a 
computer how to do something by programming it differently. So to say that 
aibopet.com was giving information about how to teach the dog to do new tricks 
is just to say that aibopet.com was giving information to users of the Aibo pet 
about how to hack their computer dog to make it do new tricks (thus, 
aibohack.com).
If you’re not a programmer or don’t know many programmers, the word hack has a 
particularly unfriendly connotation. Nonprogrammers hack bushes or weeds. 
Nonprogrammers in horror movies do even worse. But to programmers, or coders, as 
I call them, hack is a much more positive term. Hack just means code that 
enables the program to do something it wasn’t originally intended or enabled to 
do. If you buy a new printer for an old computer, you might find the old 
computer doesn’t run, or drive, the printer. If you discovered that, you’d 
later be happy to discover a hack on the Net by someone who has written a driver 
to enable the computer to drive the printer you just bought.
Some hacks are easy. Some are unbelievably hard. Hackers as a community like to 
challenge themselves and others with increasingly difficult tasks. There’s a 
certain respect that goes with the talent to hack well. There’s a well-deserved 
respect that goes with the talent to hack ethically.
The Aibo fan was displaying a bit of both when he hacked the program and offered 
to the world a bit of code that would enable the Aibo to dance jazz. The dog 
wasn’t programmed to dance jazz. It was a clever bit of tinkering that turned 
the dog into a more talented creature than Sony had built.
I’ve told this story in many contexts, both inside and outside the United 
States. Once I was asked by a puzzled member of the audience, is it permissible 
for a dog to dance jazz in the United States? We forget that stories about the 
backcountry still flow across much of the world. So let’s just be clear before 
we continue: It’s not a crime anywhere (anymore) to dance jazz. Nor is it a 
crime to teach your dog to dance jazz. Nor should it be a crime (though we don’t 
have a lot to go on here) to teach your robot dog to dance jazz. Dancing jazz is 
a completely legal activity. One imagines that the owner of aibopet.com thought, 
/What possible problem could there be with teaching a robot dog to dance?/
Let’s put the dog to sleep for a minute, and turn to a pony show not literally 
a pony show, but rather a paper that a Princeton academic named Ed Felten 
prepared for a conference. This Princeton academic is well known and respected. 
He was hired by the government in the Microsoft case to test Microsoft’s claims 
about what could and could not be done with its own code. In that trial, he 
demonstrated both his brilliance and his coolness. Under heavy badgering by 
Microsoft lawyers, Ed Felten stood his ground. He was not about to be bullied 
into being silent about something he knew very well.
But Felten’s bravery was really tested in April 2001. [22] He and a group of 
colleagues were working on a paper to be submitted at conference. The paper was 
intended to describe the weakness in an encryption system being developed by the 
Secure Digital Music Initiative as a technique to control the distribution of 
music.
The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable content owners to 
exercise much better control over their content than the Internet, as it 
originally stood, granted them. Using encryption, SDMI hoped to develop a 
standard that would allow the content owner to say this music cannot be 
copied, and have a computer respect that command. The technology was to be part 
of a trusted system of control that would get content owners to trust the 
system of the Internet much more.
When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a competition. In 
exchange for providing contestants with the code to an SDMI-encrypted bit of 
content, contestants were to try to crack it and, if they did, report the 
problems to the consortium.
Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly. He and the team 
saw the weakness of this system as a type: Many encryption systems would suffer 
the same weakness, and Felten and his team thought it worthwhile to point this 
out to those who study encryption.
Let’s review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the United States. We 
have a principle of free speech. We have this principle not just because it is 
the law, but also because it is a really great idea. A strongly protected 
tradition of free speech is likely to encourage a wide range of criticism. That 
criticism is likely, in turn, to improve the systems or people or ideas 
criticized.
What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper describing the 
weakness in a technology. They were not spreading free music, or building and 
deploying this technology. The paper was an academic essay, unintelligible to 
most people. But it clearly showed the weakness in the SDMI system, and why SDMI 
would not, as presently constituted, succeed.
What links these two, aibopet.com and Felten, is the letters they then received. 
Aibopet.com received a letter from Sony about the aibopet.com hack. Though a 
jazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal, Sony wrote:
Your site contains information providing the means to circumvent AIBO-ware’s 
copy protection protocol constituting a violation of the anti-circumvention 
provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system of encryption 
should also be perfectly legal, Felten received a letter from an RIAA lawyer 
that read:
Any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public Challenge 
would be outside the scope of activities permitted by the Agreement and could 
subject you and your research team to actions under the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act (DMCA”).
In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control the spread of 
information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act made spreading such 
information an offense.
The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners’ first fear about 
cyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was effectively dead; the 
response was to find technologies that might compensate. These new technologies 
would be copyright protection technologies technologies to control the 
replication and distribution of copyrighted material. They were designed as 
/code to modify the original code of the Internet, to reestablish some 
protection for copyright owners.
The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of this code 
designed to protect copyrighted material. It was, we could say, legal code 
intended to buttress software code which itself was intended to support the 
/legal code of copyright.
But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted works to the extent 
copyright law protected them. Its protection, that is, did not end at the line 
that copyright law drew. The DMCA regulated devices that were designed to 
circumvent copyright protection measures. It was designed to ban those devices, 
whether or not the use of the copyrighted material made possible by that 
circumvention would have been a copyright violation.
Aibopet.com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack circumvented a copyright 
protection system for the purpose of enabling the dog to dance jazz. That 
enablement no doubt involved the use of copyrighted material. But as 
aibopet.com’s site was noncommercial, and the use did not enable subsequent 
copyright infringements, there’s no doubt that aibopet.com’s hack was fair use 
of Sony’s copyrighted material. Yet fair use is not a defense to the DMCA. The 
question is not whether the use of the copyrighted material was a copyright 
violation. The question is whether a copyright protection system was 
circumvented.
The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed the same line of 
reasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a copyright protection system 
could be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer suggested, Felten himself was 
distributing a circumvention technology. Thus, even though he was not himself 
infringing anyone’s copyright, his academic paper was enabling others to 
infringe others’ copyright.
The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon drawn in 1981 by 
Paul Conrad. At that time, a court in California had held that the VCR could be 
banned because it was a copyright-infringing technology: It enabled consumers to 
copy films without the permission of the copyright owner. No doubt there were 
uses of the technology that were legal: Fred Rogers, aka Mr. Rogers, for 
example, had testified in that case that he wanted people to feel free to tape 
/Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.
Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the 
Neighborhood at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it’s a 
real service to families to be able to record such programs and show them at 
appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new 
technology that allows people to tape the Neighborhood off-the-air, and I’m 
speaking for the Neighborhood” because that’s what I produce, that they then 
become much more active in the programming of their family’s television life. 
Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole 
approach in broadcasting has always been You are an important person just the 
way you are. You can make healthy decisions. Maybe I’m going on too long, but I 
just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of 
his or her life, in a healthy way, is important. [23] 
Even though there were uses that were legal, because there were some uses that 
were illegal, the court held the companies producing the VCR responsible.
This led Conrad to draw the cartoon below, which we can adopt to the DMCA.
No argument I have can top this picture, but let me try to get close.
The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright circumvention 
technologies. Circumvention technologies can be used for different ends. They 
can be used, for example, to enable massive pirating of copyrighted materiala 
bad end. Or they can be used to enable the use of particular copyrighted 
materials in ways that would be considered fair usea good end.
[image]
A handgun can be used to shoot a police officer or a child. Most would agree 
such a use is bad. Or a handgun can be used for target practice or to protect 
against an intruder. At least some would say that such a use would be good. It, 
too, is a technology that has both good and bad uses.
The obvious point of Conrad’s cartoon is the weirdness of a world where guns are 
legal, despite the harm they can do, while VCRs (and circumvention technologies) 
are illegal. Flash: No one ever died from copyright circumvention. Yet the law 
bans circumvention technologies absolutely, despite the potential that they 
might do some good, but permits guns, despite the obvious and tragic harm they 
do.
The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners are changing the 
balance that copyright law grants. Using code, copyright owners restrict fair 
use; using the DMCA, they punish those who would attempt to evade the 
restrictions on fair use that they impose through code. Technology becomes a 
means by which fair use can be erased; the law of the DMCA backs up that 
erasing.
This is how code becomes law. The controls built into the technology of copy 
and access protection become rules the violation of which is also a violation of 
the law. In this way, the code extends the lawincreasing its regulation, even 
if the subject it regulates (activities that would otherwise plainly constitute 
fair use) is beyond the reach of the law. Code becomes law; code extends the 
law; code thus extends the control that copyright owners effectat least for 
those copyright holders with the lawyers who can write the nasty letters that 
Felten and aibopet.com received.
There is one final aspect of the interaction between architecture and law that 
contributes to the force of copyright’s regulation. This is the ease with which 
infringements of the law can be detected. For contrary to the rhetoric common at 
the birth of cyberspace that on the Internet, no one knows you’re a dog, 
increasingly, given changing technologies deployed on the Internet, it is easy 
to find the dog who committed a legal wrong. The technologies of the Internet 
are open to snoops as well as sharers, and the snoops are increasingly good at 
tracking down the identity of those who violate the rules.
For example, imagine you were part of a Star Trek fan club. You gathered every 
month to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of fan fiction about the show. 
One person would play Spock, another, Captain Kirk. The characters would begin 
with a plot from a real story, then simply continue it. [24]
Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated activity. No 
matter what happened inside your club room, you would never be interfered with 
by the copyright police. You were free in that space to do as you wished with 
this part of our culture. You were allowed to build on it as you wished without 
fear of legal control.
But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it generally available 
for others to join, the story would be very different. Bots scouring the Net for 
trademark and copyright infringement would quickly find your site. Your posting 
of fan fiction, depending upon the ownership of the series that you’re 
depicting, could well inspire a lawyer’s threat. And ignoring the lawyer’s 
threat would be extremely costly indeed. The law of copyright is extremely 
efficient. The penalties are severe, and the process is quick.
This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a change in the ease 
with which the law can be enforced. That change too shifts the law’s balance 
radically. It is as if your car transmitted the speed at which you traveled at 
every moment that you drove; that would be just one step before the state 
started issuing tickets based upon the data you transmitted. That is, in effect, 
what is happening here.
So copyright’s duration has increased dramaticallytripled in the past thirty 
years. And copyright’s scope has increased as wellfrom regulating only 
publishers to now regulating just about everyone. And copyright’s reach has 
changed, as every action becomes a copy and hence presumptively regulated. And 
as technologists find better ways to control the use of content, and as 
copyright is increasingly enforced through technology, copyright’s force 
changes, too. Misuse is easier to find and easier to control. This regulation of 
the creative process, which began as a tiny regulation governing a tiny part of 
the market for creative work, has become the single most important regulator of 
creativity there is. It is a massive expansion in the scope of the government’s 
control over innovation and creativity; it would be totally unrecognizable to 
those who gave birth to copyright’s control.
Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if it weren’t for 
one more change that we must also consider. This is a change that is in some 
sense the most familiar, though its significance and scope are not well 
understood. It is the one that creates precisely the reason to be concerned 
about all the other changes I have described.
This is the change in the concentration and integration of the media. In the 
past twenty years, the nature of media ownership has undergone a radical 
alteration, caused by changes in legal rules governing the media. Before this 
change happened, the different forms of media were owned by separate media 
companies. Now, the media is increasingly owned by only a few companies. Indeed, 
after the changes that the FCC announced in June 2003, most expect that within a 
few years, we will live in a world where just three companies control more than 
85 percent of the media.
These changes are of two sorts: the scope of concentration, and its nature.
Changes in scope are the easier ones to describe. As Senator John McCain 
summarized the data produced in the FCC’s review of media ownership, five 
companies control 85 percent of our media sources. [25] The five recording 
labels of Universal Music Group, BMG, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music 
Group, and EMI control 84.8 percent of the U.S. music market. [26] The five 
largest cable companies pipe programming to 74 percent of the cable subscribers 
nationwide. [27]
The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation, the nation’s 
largest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer than seventy-five stations. 
Today one company owns more than 1,200 stations. During that period of 
consolidation, the total number of radio owners dropped by 34 percent. Today, in 
most markets, the two largest broadcasters control 74 percent of that market’s 
revenues. Overall, just four companies control 90 percent of the nation’s radio 
advertising revenues.
Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well. Today, there are six 
hundred fewer daily newspapers in the United States than there were eighty years 
ago, and ten companies control half of the nation’s circulation. There are 
twenty major newspaper publishers in the United States. The top ten film studios 
receive 99 percent of all film revenue. The ten largest cable companies account 
for 85 percent of all cable revenue. This is a market far from the free press 
the framers sought to protect. Indeed, it is a market that is quite well 
protectedby the market.
Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious change is in the 
nature of that concentration. As author James Fallows put it in a recent article 
about Rupert Murdoch,
Murdoch’s companies now constitute a production system unmatched in its 
integration. They supply contentFox movies ... Fox TV shows ... Fox-controlled 
sports broadcasts, plus newspapers and books. They sell the content to the 
public and to advertisersin newspapers, on the broadcast network, on the cable 
channels. And they operate the physical distribution system through which the 
content reaches the customers. Murdoch’s satellite systems now distribute News 
Corp. content in Europe and Asia; if Murdoch becomes DirecTV’s largest single 
owner, that system will serve the same function in the United States. [28]
The pattern with Murdoch is the pattern of modern media. Not just large 
companies owning many radio stations, but a few companies owning as many outlets 
of media as possible. A picture describes this pattern better than a thousand 
words could do:
[image]
Does this concentration matter? Will it affect what is made, or what is 
distributed? Or is it merely a more efficient way to produce and distribute 
content?
My view was that concentration wouldn’t matter. I thought it was nothing more 
than a more efficient financial structure. But now, after reading and listening 
to a barrage of creators try to convince me to the contrary, I am beginning to 
change my mind.
Here’s a representative story that begins to suggest how this integration may 
matter.
In 1969, Norman Lear created a pilot for All in the Family. He took the pilot 
to ABC. The network didn’t like it. It was too edgy, they told Lear. Make it 
again. Lear made a second pilot, more edgy than the first. ABC was exasperated. 
You’re missing the point, they told Lear. We wanted less edgy, not more.
Rather than comply, Lear simply took the show elsewhere. CBS was happy to have 
the series; ABC could not stop Lear from walking. The copyrights that Lear held 
assured an independence from network control. [29]
The network did not control those copyrights because the law forbade the 
networks from controlling the content they syndicated. The law required a 
separation between the networks and the content producers; that separation would 
guarantee Lear freedom. And as late as 1992, because of these rules, the vast 
majority of prime time television75 percent of itwas independent of the 
networks.
In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this independence. After that 
change, the networks quickly changed the balance. In 1985, there were twenty-
five independent television production studios; in 2002, only five independent 
television studios remained. In 1992, only 15 percent of new series were 
produced for a network by a company it controlled. Last year, the percentage of 
shows produced by controlled companies more than quintupled to 77 percent. In 
1992, 16 new series were produced independently of conglomerate control, last 
year there was one. [30] In 2002, 75 percent of prime time television was owned 
by the networks that ran it. In the ten-year period between 1992 and 2002, the 
number of prime time television hours per week produced by network studios 
increased over 200%, whereas the number of prime time television hours per week 
produced by independent studios decreased 63%. [31]
Today, another Norman Lear with another All in the Family would find that he 
had the choice either to make the show less edgy or to be fired: The content of 
any show developed for a network is increasingly owned by the network.
While the number of channels has increased dramatically, the ownership of those 
channels has narrowed to an ever smaller and smaller few. As Barry Diller said 
to Bill Moyers,
Well, if you have companies that produce, that finance, that air on their 
channel and then distribute worldwide everything that goes through their 
controlled distribution system, then what you get is fewer and fewer actual 
voices participating in the process. [We u]sed to have dozens and dozens of 
thriving independent production companies producing television programs. Now you 
have less than a handful. [32]
This narrowing has an effect on what is produced. The product of such large and 
concentrated networks is increasingly homogenous. Increasingly safe. 
Increasingly sterile. The product of news shows from networks like this is 
increasingly tailored to the message the network wants to convey. This is not 
the communist party, though from the inside, it must feel a bit like the 
communist party. No one can question without risk of consequencenot necessarily 
banishment to Siberia, but punishment nonetheless. Independent, critical, 
different views are quashed. This is not the environment for a democracy.
Economics itself offers a parallel that explains why this integration affects 
creativity. Clay Christensen has written about the Innovator’s Dilemma: the 
fact that large traditional firms find it rational to ignore new, breakthrough 
technologies that compete with their core business. The same analysis could help 
explain why large, traditional media companies would find it rational to ignore 
new cultural trends. [33] Lumbering giants not only don’t, but should not, 
sprint. Yet if the field is only open to the giants, there will be far too 
little sprinting.
I don’t think we know enough about the economics of the media market to say with 
certainty what concentration and integration will do. The efficiencies are 
important, and the effect on culture is hard to measure.
But there is a quintessentially obvious example that does strongly suggest the 
concern.
In addition to the copyright wars, we’re in the middle of the drug wars. 
Government policy is strongly directed against the drug cartels; criminal and 
civil courts are filled with the consequences of this battle.
Let me hereby disqualify myself from any possible appointment to any position in 
government by saying I believe this war is a profound mistake. I am not pro 
drugs. Indeed, I come from a family once wrecked by drugsthough the drugs that 
wrecked my family were all quite legal. I believe this war is a profound mistake 
because the collateral damage from it is so great as to make waging the war 
insane. When you add together the burdens on the criminal justice system, the 
desperation of generations of kids whose only real economic opportunities are as 
drug warriors, the queering of constitutional protections because of the 
constant surveillance this war requires, and, most profoundly, the total 
destruction of the legal systems of many South American nations because of the 
power of the local drug cartels, I find it impossible to believe that the 
marginal benefit in reduced drug consumption by Americans could possibly 
outweigh these costs.
You may not be convinced. That’s fine. We live in a democracy, and it is through 
votes that we are to choose policy. But to do that, we depend fundamentally upon 
the press to help inform Americans about these issues.
Beginning in 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy launched a media 
campaign as part of the war on drugs. The campaign produced scores of short 
film clips about issues related to illegal drugs. In one series (the Nick and 
Norm series) two men are in a bar, discussing the idea of legalizing drugs as a 
way to avoid some of the collateral damage from the war. One advances an 
argument in favor of drug legalization. The other responds in a powerful and 
effective way against the argument of the first. In the end, the first guy 
changes his mind (hey, it’s television). The plug at the end is a damning attack 
on the pro-legalization campaign.
Fair enough. It’s a good ad. Not terribly misleading. It delivers its message 
well. It’s a fair and reasonable message.
But let’s say you think it is a wrong message, and you’d like to run a 
countercommercial. Say you want to run a series of ads that try to demonstrate 
the extraordinary collateral harm that comes from the drug war. Can you do it?
Well,obviously, these ads cost lots of money. Assume you raise the money. Assume 
a group of concerned citizens donates all the money in the world to help you get 
your message out. Can you be sure your message will be heard then?
No.You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of avoiding 
controversial ads. Ads sponsored by the government are deemed uncontroversial; 
ads disagreeing with the government are controversial. This selectivity might be 
thought inconsistent with the First Amendment, but the Supreme Court has held 
that stations have the right to choose what they run. Thus, the major channels 
of commercial media will refuse one side of a crucial debate the opportunity to 
present its case. And the courts will defend the rights of the stations to be 
this biased. [34]
I’d be happy to defend the networks’ rights, as wellif we lived in a media 
market that was truly diverse. But concentration in the media throws that 
condition into doubt. If a handful of companies control access to the media, and 
that handful of companies gets to decide which political positions it will allow 
to be promoted on its channels, then in an obvious and important way, 
concentration matters. You might like the positions the handful of companies 
selects. But you should not like a world in which a mere few get to decide which 
issues the rest of us get to know about.
There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the copyright 
warriors that the government should protect my property. In the abstract, it 
is obviously true and, ordinarily, totally harmless. No sane sort who is not an 
anarchist could disagree.
But when we see how dramatically this property has changed when we recognize 
how it might now interact with both technology and markets to mean that the 
effective constraint on the liberty to cultivate our culture is dramatically 
differentthe claim begins to seem less innocent and obvious. Given (1) the 
power of technology to supplement the law’s control, and (2) the power of 
concentrated markets to weaken the opportunity for dissent, if strictly 
enforcing the massively expanded property rights granted by copyright 
fundamentally changes the freedom within this culture to cultivate and build 
upon our past, then we have to ask whether this property should be redefined.
Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should abolish copyright or 
go back to the eighteenth century. That would be a total mistake, disastrous for 
the most important creative enterprises within our culture today.
But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture notwithstanding. And 
these massive shifts in the effective power of copyright regulation, tied to 
increased concentration of the content industry and resting in the hands of 
technology that will increasingly enable control over the use of culture, should 
drive us to consider whether another adjustment is called for. Not an adjustment 
that increases copyright’s power. Not an adjustment that increases its term. 
Rather, an adjustment to restore the balance that has traditionally defined 
copyright’s regulationa weakening of that regulation, to strengthen creativity.
Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It’s not a set of constant 
commitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers and geeks now flout. 
Instead, copyright power has grown dramatically in a short period of time, as 
the technologies of distribution and creation have changed and as lobbyists have 
pushed for more control by copyright holders. Changes in the past in response to 
changes in technology suggest that we may well need similar changes in the 
future. And these changes have to be reductions in the scope of copyright, in 
response to the extraordinary increase in control that technology and the market 
enable.
For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a point that we see 
only after surveying the range of these changes. When you add together the 
effect of changing law, concentrated markets, and changing technology, together 
they produce an astonishing conclusion: Never in our history have fewer had a 
legal right to control more of the development of our culture than now.
Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were perpetual, they 
affected only that precise creative work. Not when only publishers had the tools 
to publish, for the market then was much more diverse. Not when there were only 
three television networks, for even then, newspapers, film studios, radio 
stations, and publishers were independent of the networks. Never has copyright 
protected such a wide range of rights, against as broad a range of actors, for a 
term that was remotely as long. This form of regulationa tiny regulation of a 
tiny part of the creative energy of a nation at the foundingis now a massive 
regulation of the overall creative process. Law plus technology plus the market 
now interact to turn this historically benign regulation into the most 
significant regulation of culture that our free society has known. [35]
This has been a long chapter. Its point can now be briefly stated.
At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial and noncommercial 
culture. In the course of this chapter, I have distinguished between copying a 
work and transforming it. We can now combine these two distinctions and draw a 
clear map of the changes that copyright law has undergone.
In 1790, the law looked like this:
The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by copyright law. 
Nothing else was. Transformations were free. And as copyright attached only with 
registration, and only those who intended to benefit commercially would 
register, copying through publishing of noncommercial work was also free.
By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to this:
Derivative works were now regulated by copyright lawif published, which again, 
given the economics of publishing at the time, means if offered commercially. 
But noncommercial publishing and transformation were still essentially free.
In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and after this 
change, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As the technology of 
copying became more prevalent, the reach of the law expanded. Thus by 1975, as 
photocopying machines became more common, we could say the law began to look 
like this:
The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through, say, copy 
machines, but still much of copying outside of the commercial market remained 
free. But the consequence of the emergence of digital technologies, especially 
in the context of a digital network, means that the law now looks like this:
Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most creativity was 
not. The law now regulates the full range of creativitycommercial or not, 
transformative or notwith the same rules designed to regulate commercial 
publishers.
Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is regulation that does no 
good. So the question that we should be asking just now is whether extending the 
regulations of copyright law into each of these domains actually does any good.
I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial copying. But I also 
have no doubt that it does more harm than good when regulating (as it regulates 
just now) noncommercial copying and, especially, noncommercial transformation. 
And increasingly, for the reasons sketched especially in chapters 7 and 8, one 
might well wonder whether it does more harm than good for commercial 
transformation. More commercial transformative work would be created if 
derivative rights were more sharply restricted.
The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property. Of course 
copyright is a kind of property, and of course, as with any property, the 
state ought to protect it. But first impressions notwithstanding, historically, 
this property right (as with all property rights [36]) has been crafted to 
balance the important need to give authors and artists incentives with the 
equally important need to assure access to creative work. This balance has 
always been struck in light of new technologies. And for almost half of our 
tradition, the copyright did not control at all the freedom of others to 
build upon or transform a creative work. American culture was born free, and for 
almost 180 years our country consistently protected a vibrant and rich free 
culture.
We achieved that free culture because our law respected important limits on the 
scope of the interests protected by property. The very birth of copyright as 
a statutory right recognized those limits, by granting copyright owners 
protection for a limited time only (the story of chapter 6). The tradition of 
fair use is animated by a similar concern that is increasingly under strain as 
the costs of exercising any fair use right become unavoidably high (the story of 
chapter 7). Adding statutory rights where markets might stifle innovation is 
another familiar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And 
granting archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of property 
notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul of a culture 
(chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets, are built with property. But the 
nature of the property that builds a free culture is very different from the 
extremist vision that dominates the debate today.
Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy. In response to 
a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the technologies of the Internet 
present to twentieth-century business models for producing and distributing 
culture, the law and technology are being transformed in a way that will 
undermine our tradition of free culture. The property right that is copyright is 
no longer the balanced right that it was, or was intended to be. The property 
right that is copyright has become unbalanced, tilted toward an extreme. The 
opportunity to create and transform becomes weakened in a world in which 
creation requires permission and creativity must check with a lawyer.
