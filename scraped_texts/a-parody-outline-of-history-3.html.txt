They of Genoa tell with a shrug how in the old days Cristofer
Colombo whom men called the Dreamer left Dame Colombo to go in
search of the land of his imagining.
And the tale tells how, on a twilight Thursday, Colombo walked
alone on the edge of a doubtful wood, and viewed many things not
salutary to notice. And there came to him one who was as
perversely tall as a certain unmentionable object and bearded in
a manner it is not convenient to describe.
But Colombo set about that which the stranger said was necessary
and when he had finished he drank the contents of the curious
skull as had been foretold on a certain All-Saints day. Then it
was that the stranger spoke.
“Whom are you”, said he, “to be thus wandering in the very
unspeakable forest of the very unnamable sorcerer Thyrston?”
Said Colombo, “I have heard of this Thyrston.  And while I do not
criticize, yet I cannot entirely agree with your improper use of
the pronoun WHOM, and oh my dear sir”, said Colombo, “those two
VERYS would surely—oh, most surely—be mentioned in ’The Conning
Tower’.”
“Eh!” said Thyrston, frowning.
“I allude”, said Colombo, “to the scribbling of a certain Adams
with whom you are doubtless familiar, and of course, my dear
Thyrston”, said Colombo, “I spoke only jestingly, for I am
Cristofer Colombo whom men call the Dreamer, and I go in search
of the land of my imagining and it is truly a pleasure to meet
the greatest sorcerer since Ckellyr, and how”, said Colombo, “is
dear Mrs. Thyrston?”
Then Thyrston showed Colombo what was written on the insecure
parchment. It frightened Colombo a little, but he assented.  And
when the sorcerer had borrowed a silk hat and a gold watch he
caused the skies to darken and Colombo saw that which men refuse
to believe.
“But, oh, now really sir”, said Colombo, “that is indeed
extremely clever and I do wish that the children were here to see
it and would you mind, my dear Thyrston”, said Colombo, “doing
that egg trick again?”
Then Thyrston showed Colombo that he had nothing up either sleeve
and after an interval he consented to teach Colombo the secret of
his conjuring.
“Why now to be sure”, said Colombo, after he had thoroughly
mastered the trick, “that is indeed quite simple and I am sorry I
broke those four eggs by mistake in your silk hat, and while I do
not wish to appear oversensitive, do you not think, my dear
Thyrston”, said Colombo, “that the trick would go just as well
without those abominable jokes about married life?”
“My dear sir”, said Thyrston, “those jokes have been used by
every conjurer since Merlin, and while perhaps without them your
trick would work, yet I have never heard of it being done and I
have found”, said Thyrston, “that in sorcery the best results are
obtained by doing the customary thing.”
“Which only goes to show”, said Colombo, “that sorcery is
somewhat akin to business, and now that I think of it”, said
Colombo, “I believe that the term wizard of industry is perhaps
not entirely a misnomer.”
Thus it was that Colombo took leave of Thyrston, and the tale
tells how on Walburga’s Eve he came to the court of King
Ferdinand and Queen Isabel.  And as he entered one met him who
was not unpleasing to the eye, and she was weeping.  And, as it
was somewhat dark, Colombo decided to comfort her.
“Now, do you tell me, my dear”, said Colombo, after an interval,
“why it is you weep, for I am Colombo whom men call the Dreamer,
and I go in search of the land of my imagining, and I think”,
said Colombo, “that you have most remarkably lovely eyes.”
“Oh messire”, said the lady, “I weep because it is this evening
that I am to entertain the ladies of our Progress Literary Club,
and Donna Margarita whom men call the Spanish Omelet, but who
really, messire, has a lovely voice, was going to sing ’The
Rosary’ and now she has a cold and cannot sing, and King
Ferdinand is coming, and oh, messire, what”, said the lady,
“shall I do?”
“Why now, truly”, said Colombo, “in Genoa it was the judgment of
all the really musically intelligent ladies, except perhaps my
wife, that I sang not an unpleasing baritone, and while I do not
know the song to which you refer, yet I have devoted most of my
life to the composition of a poem concerning the land of my
imagining which might well be sung and besides that”, said
Colombo, “I can do a most remarkable egg trick.”
So it was that Colombo became for a short time not undeservedly
the life of the Progress Literary Club party. And the tale tells
how, after a paper by Donna Violet Balboa on “Spanish
Architecture—Then and Now”, Colombo sang to them the song of the
land of Colombo’s imagining. And poignantly beautiful was the
song, for in it was the beauty of a poet’s dream, and the eternal
loveliness of that vision which men have glimpsed in all ages if
ever so faintly. And when he had finished, the eyes of Colombo
were wet with tears, for into this poem had he woven the dreams
of his disillusionment. And somewhat ironical to Colombo was the
applause of those fine ladies who did not at all understand.
“Now that is a pretty song”, said King Ferdinand, “and do you
tell us, Colombo, how one may get to this land, so that I may
extend the borders of my most Catholic Kingdom and spread the
teachings of the true faith, for to bring the world under the
blessed influence of my religion is my only purpose, and really
now”, said King Ferdinand, “is there as much gold there as you
describe?”
“Ah, King Ferdinand”, replied Colombo, “there is more gold than
ever I can tell, and I see only too plainly how grievously you
suffer to think that perhaps these people are living in ignorance
of the true faith. And I could ask nothing better than that King
Ferdinand give me ships in which I may sail to the westward and
come at last to the land of my imagining. This I would do in
order that the blessed soldiers of King Ferdinand who will follow
me may show to the inhabitants of my discovered land the grievous
errors of their ways and bring them at last to a realization of
the true faith which has been so helpful to our own dear Spain,
and”, added Colombo, “our gracious sovereign Ferdinand.”
And droll it was to Colombo to think what might possibly happen
were King Ferdinand to take his dream seriously or were the King
perhaps to be informed as to the true meaning of Colombo’s
subtleties.
“Well, now”, said King Ferdinand, “of course, to fit out such an
expedition would require great expense, my dear Colombo—great
expense. And, of course, you know, Colombo, that when investors
can buy Inquisition 4 1/4’s for 89 it would be extremely
difficult to raise the money for such a speculative project—oh,
extremely difficult. And then you must consider the present
depression—tell me now, Colombo”, said King Ferdinand, “how long
do you think this depression will last, for I seek, above all
things, a return to healthy normalcy.”
“Well, truly”, replied Colombo, “that would be most difficult to
say. I note that on Rodigruez Babsyn’s last chart—”
“I wish this Babsyn and his charts were in hell”, said King
Ferdinand, “for it was he who advised me to sell Queen Isabel’s
silver holdings. But it occurs to me, Colombo, that in connection
with this land-of-gold scheme of yours, you mentioned something
about sailing to the westward. Now Colombo, that would be a
distinct disadvantage when it came to marketing the bonds, for as
you must already know, one cannot sail to the west without
encountering fierce and enormous monsters who swallow, I am told,
whole ships at a gulp.”
“Now as to that”, said Colombo, somewhat embarrassed at the turn
of the conversation for WEST had merely happened to better suit
the rhymes of his poem, “you may be right, and I should not go so
far as to say you are wrong, but still at the same time”, said
Colombo, “is there any gentleman in the audience who can lend me
an egg and a silk hat?”
And when an unmentionable egg and a doubtful silk hat had been
produced in a manner which it is not convenient to mention
Colombo rolled up both his sleeves and spoke the magic speech as
he had learned it on a certain Thursday from the sorcerer
Thyrston.
“Ladies and gentlemen”, said Colombo, “I have here a common
household egg which I shall now ask the ushers to pass among you
so you may see for yourself that there are no wires or strings
attached. While this is being done, ladies and gentlemen, I wish
that three of you would step up on the stage.  Any three—don’t
be bashful girls— I won’t hurt you.  Won’t that couple over
there kindly oblige me— that married couple—no, folks, I guess
they aren’t married either— they look too happy.”
Very painful it was to Colombo to hear these horrible jokes
coming from his mouth, but Thyrston had quoted the authority of
all successful sorcerers and not for anything would Colombo have
had his trick a failure.
“Now ladies and gentlemen”, said Colombo, “I am going to ask this
lady and these two gentlemen if they will be so good as to see if
they can take this little egg and make it stand on end without
any support.”
And very droll it was to see the unsuccessful attempts which the
three made. Finally Colombo said:
“Now ladies and gentlemen, I want you to watch me closely. I put
the silk hat on my head—thus.  And I take the egg in my right
hand—thus.  Now, if this young lady will be kind enough to hold
my left hand—I hope that her best fellow doesn’t mind letting
such a pretty girl hold my hand—it’s lucky my wife can’t see me,
though—a friend said to me the other day, ’Who was that lady I
seen you with?’ and I said, ’That wasn’t no lady, that was my
wife’. Now ladies and gentlemen I take this egg, and in order to
make it stand upright I tap one end gently— thus against the
table until that end is flattened— and then, presto—the egg
stands upright.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you one and all
for your kind attention.”
Thus it was that Colombo impressed King Ferdinand and his court
with his profound knowledge of geography.  Next the tale tells
how there came to Colombo on Michaelmas Eve one sent by Queen
Isabel, And when Colombo had buckled on his sword Impavide he
followed the messenger through winding corridors and came at last
to the chamber of the Queen.  And as he knelt before her it
seemed to Colombo that never before had he seen such
unforgettable beauty as shone in the eyes of Queen Isabel.  Yes,
truly, this was the loveliest girl that Colombo had ever
imagined.
“Now do you rise”, said she, “and you and I shall have a nice
chat alone here together, and you can tell me all about geography
of which I am oh, frightfully ignorant.  In truth”, said she, “I
have tried to get Ferdinand to instruct me, but I fear”, said
Queen Isabel, “that Ferdinand does not understand me.”
So Colombo instructed Queen Isabel in the fundamentals of
geography. And after a while he spoke.
“Now many people”, said Colombo, “believe that the earth is flat,
but”, said Colombo, “such is not at all the case.”
And after an interval Colombo said, “There, my dear, do you not
see how ridiculous it is to suppose that the earth is anything
but round?”
“Why surely, sire”, said Queen Isabel, “you make it appear very
round. And I wonder that I had not thought of that before.  And I
think”, said Queen Isabel, “that geography is a most fascinating
subject and oh, messire Colombo”, said the Queen, “you must come
and instruct me often.”
Thus it was that Colombo became Royal Geographer.  And the tale
tells how after a while various whisperings came to King
Ferdinand of his queen’s curious enthusiasm for study.
“Now about this geography”, said King Ferdinand one evening to
the Queen, “I am, my dear, indeed glad to see you take an
interest in such an important study and I have arranged”, said
the King, “to have your tutoring in the future done by Father
Bernadino who has had fifty-two years’ experience at the
University, and your lessons”, said the King, “will commence
tomorrow.”
Said the Queen, “How can I thank you enough, dear Ferdinand, for
your untiring interest in my welfare.  For I have been struggling
along in my study of geography with a horribly dull clod whose
name”, said the Queen, “I cannot remember.”
“Was it, by any chance, Colombo?” asked the King.
“Perhaps”, said the Queen.  “But I am oh so glad to be rid of
him.” And indeed so great was the happiness of Queen Isabel that
her pillow that night was wet with tears.
But King Ferdinand was an unusually efficient king, and he spared
no pains in his craving for normalcy.  So it was that the next
day he called to him the man who had chanced to be Royal
Geographer before the coup d’oeuf of Colombo.
“Now tell me”, said the King, “is there any chance that a man who
sails to the westward will ever return?”
“None, your Majesty”, said the ex-Royal Geographer.  “For many
have tried and horrible are the tales which they tell of demons
and monsters lying in wait for the ships of men. And I should say
definitely, oh King”, said he, “that whoever sails to the
westward will never return.”
And the tale tells how that afternoon Colombo stood before King
Ferdinand.  And very strange to Colombo was the enthusiasm which
burned in the King’s otherwise somewhat fishlike eye.
“For know you, Colombo”, the King was saying, “that God has
spoken to me and commanded me to save from the fires of hell the
inhabitants of those golden lands of which you sang. And to you,
my dear Colombo, is to be given the chance which you so ardently
desire.  For I have this day purchased three ships which await
your command, and within a week you should be well on your way on
this glorious mission for God and for Spain, and”, said the King,
“I might add that the Queen, too, is much interested in this
voyage and has even been persuaded to dispose of her jewels in
order that you may make haste.”
“Such instant obedience to the will of God”, said Colombo, “and
such fine enthusiasm to further His kingdom on earth, does your
Majesties great credit. And I shall indeed congratulate the
inhabitants of this to-be-discovered land for their good fortune
in obtaining such a devout King.”
And the tale tells how that night Colombo took leave of Queen
Isabel.  “Now do not weep, oh Queen”, said he, “for I am only
Colombo whom men call the Dreamer, and I go in search of the land
of my imagining, and perhaps”, said Colombo, “I shall return."
But they tell how Queen Isabel refused to be comforted for many
and many a day.  And unexplainably curious to Father Bernadino
was his absolute and complete failure as a royal instructor in
geography, for Father Bernadino had taught for fifty-two years at
the University.
And so it was that Colombo sat alone in the cabin of the ship
which carried him towards the land of his imagining. And strange
and somewhat fearsome it was to the sailors to see their captain
sitting thus motionless night after night, for already had they
left the Canaries far behind and some there were who said that a
madman commanded their ship, and others who whispered of horrible
monsters in these western seas.
And the tale tells how one night Colombo observed across his
table one who had not been sitting there a moment before and
whose hair was strangely red.
“Well now, truly, sir”, said Colombo, “This is very curious. For
I do not remember seeing you among the crew nor were you ever at
the court, and on the whole”, said Colombo, “your red hair and
your sneering grin interrupt my dreams, and dreams”, said
Colombo, “are all that I have left.”
“For know you, sir”, continued he to the stranger who did not
speak, “that on this earth man has been able to endure only by
playing the ape to his dreams.  And in every generation”, said
Colombo, “there have been those who dreamed of beautiful things
and in every age there have been those who caught some glimpse of
that perfect beauty which the Greeks call Helen, and to have seen
Helen”, said Colombo, “is to have been touched with divine and
unbearable madness.”
And it became strangely quiet in the cabin as Colombo continued:
“And those authors who wrote perfectly of beautiful dreams”, said
he, “will, perchance, endure, and those who saw only men as they
are, will perish—for so has it been in the past and so will it
be in the future. All of which”, said Colombo, “is a rather
tiresome and pedantic excuse for the fact that I am about to read
you my own poem.”
And Colombo read to the stranger the dream of the land of
Colombo’s imagining, and when he had finished the stranger smiled
and shook his head sadly.
“Come, now,” said Colombo, somewhat hurt.  “Do not, I pray you,
pretend to like it unless you really do. Of course it is not at
all the kind of thing that will sell, is it— and the metre must
be patched up in places, don’t you think? And some of the most
beautiful passages would never be permitted by the censor—but
still—” and Colombo paused hopefully, for it was Colombo’s poem
and into it he had poured the heart of his life and it seemed to
him now, more than ever, a beautiful thing.
The stranger handed Colombo a book.
“There”, said he, “is the land of your imagining”, and in his
eyes gleamed a curious sardonic mockery.
And Colombo read the book.  And when he had finished his face was
grey as are old ashes in ancient urns, and about the mouth of him
whom men called the Dreamer were curious hard lines.
“Now, by Heaven”, said Colombo brandishing his sword Impavide,
“you lie. And your Gopher Prairie is a lie.  And you are all, all
contemptible, you who dip your pens in tracing ink and seek to
banish beautiful dreams from the world.”
But the red-haired stranger had vanished and Colombo found that
he was alone and to Colombo the world seemed cheerless and as a
place that none has lived in for a long time.
“Now this is curious”, mused Colombo, “for I have evidently been
dreaming and a more horrible dream have I never had, and I
think”, said Colombo, “that while all this quite certainly did
not actually take place, yet that grinning red head has upset me
horribly and on the whole”, said Colombo, “I believe the safest
course would be to put back at once for Spain, for certainly I
have no desire to take the remotest chance of discovering
anything which may in the least resemble that Gopher Prairie.”
And the tale tells that as Colombo started for the deck in order
that he might give the signal for the return to Spain, there came
across the water from one of the other ships the faint cry of a
sailor. And the sailor was waving his hat and shouting, “Land
Ho!”
Thus it was that Cristofer Colombo became the discoverer of the
land of his imagining, and as he stood on the deck Colombo mused.
“Now this is a sorrowful jest and a very unfair jest that is
happening,” said he.  “For I who have dreamed a beautiful dream
of the land of my imagining will quite probably henceforth be
known only as the discoverer of what will turn out to be merely
one more hideous and stupid country.” And tears came to the eyes
of Colombo, for on the waves behind him floated the torn and
scattered pages of the poem which sang the imagined vision of
Beauty of him whom men long and long ago called the
Dreamer.
Thus it was in the old days.
There is a lesson for us all in this beautiful story of how
Columbus realized his ambition to be a great discoverer.
Men called Columbus a Dreamer—but that is just what folks once
said about Thomas A. Edison and Henry Ford.
The world has a place for Dreamers—if they are Practical
Dreamers.
Columbus was ambitious.  Ambition is a great thing if it is
unselfish ambition.  By unselfish I mean for the greatest good of
the greatest number.  Shakespeare, the great teacher, shows us in
“Macbeth” what happens to the selfishly ambitious man.
Columbus got ahead by paying attention to small details. 
Whatever he did, he did to the best of his ability.  Even when
engaged in teaching geography to the Queen, Columbus was the best
geography teacher he knew how to be. And before long he was made
Royal Geographer.
In our daily lives let us all resolve to be good teachers of
geography. We may not all become Royal Geographers—but there
will be to us the lasting satisfaction of having done our best. 
And that, as a greater than I has said, is “more precious than
rubies—yea, than much fine gold”.
