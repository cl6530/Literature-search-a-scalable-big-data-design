Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny woman lived in a teeny-tiny
house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day this teeny-tiny woman put
on her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny house to take
a teeny-tiny walk. And when this teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-
tiny way she came to a teeny-tiny gate; so the teeny-tiny woman opened
the teeny-tiny gate, and went into a teeny-tiny churchyard. And when
this teeny-tiny woman had got into the teeny-tiny churchyard, she saw
a teeny-tiny bone on a teeny-tiny grave, and the teeny-tiny woman said
to her teeny-tiny self, “This teeny-tiny bone will make me some teeny-
tiny soup for my teeny-tiny supper.” So the teeny-tiny woman put the
teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny pocket, and went home to her
teeny-tiny house.
Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny house she was
a teeny-tiny bit tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to her
teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny
cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep a teeny-
tiny time, she was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny
cupboard, which said:
“Give me my bone!”
And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened, so she hid her
teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes and went to sleep again.
And when she had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny
voice again cried out from the teeny-tiny cupboard a teeny-tiny
louder, “Give me my bone!”
This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened, so she
hid her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny
clothes. And when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again a
teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard
said again a teeny-tiny louder,
“Give me my bone!”
And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more frightened, but
she put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny clothes, and said in
her loudest teeny-tiny voice, “TAKE IT!”
