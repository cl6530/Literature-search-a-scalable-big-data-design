The 13th August arrived, on which day I noticed a general advance
of the American land and sea forces towards Manila, the former being
under command of General Anderson at Paranaque.
Subsequently I ordered a general assault of the Spanish lines and
in the course of this movement General Pio del Pilar succeeded in
advancing through Sampalok and attacked the Spanish troops who where
defending the Puente Colgante, [3] causing the enemy to fall back on
the Bridge of Spain. The column commanded by our General, Sr. Gregorio
II. del Pilar, took the suburbs of Pretil, Tendo, Divisoria and Paseo
de Azcarraga, situated north of Manila city; while General Noriel’s
command, near Pasay, took the suburbs of Singalong and Pako, and
following the American column he out-flanked the Spaniards who were
defending San Antonio Abad. The Spanish officers observing General
Noriel’s move ordered their men to retreat towards the Walled City,
whereupon the Americans who held the foremost trenches entered Malate
and Ermita without firing a shot. At this point the Americans met
General Noriel’s troops who had captured the above mentioned suburbs
and were quartered in the building formerly used by the Exposicion
Regional de Filipinas, [4] in the Normal, and in Sr. Perez’ house
in Paco.
In Santa Ana (the eastern section of Manila) General Ricarto
successfully routed five companies of Spaniards, being aided in this
by the manoeuvres of General Pio del Pilar’s brigade.
