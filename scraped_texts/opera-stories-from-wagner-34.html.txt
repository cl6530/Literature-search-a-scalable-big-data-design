the little black Nibelungs found that Mimi had run away and had taken
all of his best tools with him!
How they must have rushed about, each anxious to tell another the news
of the missing Mimi!
Of course, Alberich guessed very quickly for what purpose his brother
had gone.
And how Alberich must have raged when he thought of what a sad day it
would be for him should Mimi become owner of that ring!

go there and search until I know who has it. Then I will find some way
of getting it.”
On he went, until he came to the darkest place in the woods.
