He howled, without looking up from the fire:
–Kinch!
–It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set
ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway,
looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down
to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he
carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down
heavily and sighed with relief.
–I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ... But, hush! Not a
word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,
come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.
Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
–What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.
–We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the
locker.
–O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
milk.
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
–That woman is coming up with the milk.
–The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I
can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates,
saying:
–In Nomine Patris Et Filii Et Spiritus Sancti.
Haines sat down to pour out the tea.
–I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s
wheedling voice:
–When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
makes water I makes water.
–By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
–SO I DO, MRS CAHILL, says she. BEGOB, MA’AM, says Mrs Cahill, GOD SEND
YOU DON’T MAKE THEM IN THE ONE POT.
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.
–That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines
of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:
–Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of
in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?
–I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
–Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?
–I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.
–Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and
blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!
Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
  –FOR OLD MARY ANN
    SHE DOESN’T CARE A DAMN.
    BUT, HISING UP HER PETTICOATS ...
He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.
–The milk, sir!
–Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.
–That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
–To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.
–The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces.
–How much, sir? asked the old woman.
–A quart, Stephen said.
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a
tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her
toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed
about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old
woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an
immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,
whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
–It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.
–Taste it, sir, she said.
He drank at her bidding.
–If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with
dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.
–Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
–I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.
–Look at that now, she said.
Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is
of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s
likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be
silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
–Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
–Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
–Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
–I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
west, sir?
–I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
–He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish
in Ireland.
–Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the
language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.
–Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?
–No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.
Haines said to her:
–Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?
Stephen filled again the three cups.
–Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
trouser pockets.
–Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick
rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his
fingers and cried:
–A miracle!
He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
–Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
–We’ll owe twopence, he said.
–Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,
sir.
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:
  –HEART OF MY HEART, WERE IT MORE,
    MORE WOULD BE LAID AT YOUR FEET.
He turned to Stephen and said:
–Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.
–That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
national library today.
–Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
–Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
Then he said to Haines:
–The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
–All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
–I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.
–That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good.
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth
of tone:
–Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
–Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
–Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the
hammock, said:
–I don’t know, I’m sure.
He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and
said with coarse vigour:
–You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
–Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.
–I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.
–I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.
–From me, Kinch, he said.
In a suddenly changed tone he added:
–To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they
are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let
us get out of the kip.
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:
–Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
He emptied his pockets on to the table.
–There’s your snotrag, he said.
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,
we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green
boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I
contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands.
–And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.
Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
doorway:
–Are you coming, you fellows?
–I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with
grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
–And going forth he met Butterly.
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
–Did you bring the key?
–I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
–Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
Haines asked:
–Do you pay rent for this tower?
–Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
–To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
–Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
–Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
the sea. But ours is the OMPHALOS.
–What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
–No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fifty-five reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have
a few pints in me first.
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:
–You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
–It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
–You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
–Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is
Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.
–What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
–O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
–We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
rather long to tell.
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.
–The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
–I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower
and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. THAT BEETLES O’ER
HIS BASE INTO THE SEA, ISN’T IT?
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. for an instant towards Stephen but did not
speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap
dusty mourning between their gay attires.
–It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking
by the Muglins.
–I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father.
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at
them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a
doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began
to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
  –I’M THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD.
    MY MOTHER’S A JEW, MY FATHER’S A BIRD.
    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE.
    SO HERE’S TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY.
He held up a forefinger of warning.
  –IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMN’T DIVINE
    HE’LL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN I’M MAKING THE WINE
    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN
    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN.
He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward
to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
  –GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID
    AND TELL TOM, DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD.
    WHAT’S BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY
    AND OLIVET’S BREEZY ... GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE!
He capered before them down towards the forty-foot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind
that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
said:
–We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a
believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?
–The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
–O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
–Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
–You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the
narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal God.
–There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green
stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
–Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
–Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or
you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?
–You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought.
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My
familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along
the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants
that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him
the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.
–After all, Haines began ...
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
all unkind.
–After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
own master, it seems to me.
–I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.
–Italian? Haines said.
A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.
–And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
–Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
–The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.
–I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather
unfairly. It seems history is to blame.
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
their brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM:
the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,
a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope
Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and
behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and
menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry:
Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius,
warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the
Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle
African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own
Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.
Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a
menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the
church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with
their lances and their shields.
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. ZUT! NOM DE DIEU!
–Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
–She’s making for Bullock harbour.
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
–There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way
when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.
The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for
a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.
Here I am.
They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on
a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A
young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his
green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
–Is the brother with you, Malachi?
–Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
–Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
–Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water
glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling
over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging
loincloth.
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
and breastbone.
–Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
–Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
–Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
–Yes.
–Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
money.
–Is she up the pole?
–Better ask Seymour that.
–Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:
–Redheaded women buck like goats.
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
–My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the UBERMENSCH. Toothless Kinch
and I, the supermen.
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.
–Are you going in here, Malachi?
–Yes. Make room in the bed.
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking.
–Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
–Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
Stephen turned away.
–I’m going, Mulligan, he said.
–Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.
–And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
–He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
Zarathustra.
His plump body plunged.
–We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path
and smiling at wild Irish.
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
–The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
–Good, Stephen said.
He walked along the upwardcurving path.
    LILIATA RUTILANTIUM.
    TURMA CIRCUMDET.
    IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM.
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
seal’s, far out on the water, round.
Usurper.
–You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
–Tarentum, sir.
–Very good. Well?
–There was a battle, sir.
–Very good. Where?
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.
Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of
excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?
–I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
–Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred
book.
–Yes, sir. And he said: ANOTHER VICTORY LIKE THAT AND WE ARE DONE FOR.
That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
–You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
–End of Pyrrhus, sir?
–I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
–Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud
that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.
–Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at
his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more
loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
–Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,
what is a pier.
–A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All.
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes:
their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering
in the struggle.
–Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
