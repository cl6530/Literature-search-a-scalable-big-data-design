It was already late afternoon and the gas street lamps of the
Boul’ Mich’ were being lighted for Paris, or at least for Paris
in summer, by a somewhat frigid looking allumeur, when Philip
Custer came to the end of his letter. He hesitated for an
instant, wrote “Your----,” then crossed that out and substituted
“Sincerely.”  No, decidedly the first ending, with its, as is,
or, rather, as ordinarily is, the case in hymeneal epistles,
somewhat possessive sense, would no longer suffice.  “Yours
truly"— perhaps; “sincerely"—better; but certainly not “Your
husband.” He was done, thank God, with presences.
Philip sipped his absinthe and gazed for an instant through the
Cafe window; a solitary fiacre rattled by; he picked up the
result of his afternoon’s labor, wearily.
“Dear Mary,” he read, “When I told you that my employers were
sending me to Paris, I lied to you.  It was, perhaps, the first
direct lie that I ever told you; it was, I know now, the last.
But a falsehood by word of mouth mattered really very little in
comparison with the enormous lie that my life with you had
become.”
Philip paused and smiled, somewhat bitterly, at that point in the
letter.  Mary, with her American woman’s intuition, would
undoubtedly surmise that he had run off with Mrs. Everett; there
was a certain ironical humor in the fact that Mary’s mistaken
guess would be sadly indicative of her whole failure to
understand what her husband was, to use a slang expression,
“driving at.”
“I hope that you will believe me when I say that I came to Paris
to paint. In the past four years the desire to do that has grown
steadily until it has mastered me.  You do not understand.  I
found no one in America who did. I think my mother might have,
had she lived; certainly it is utterly incomprehensible to
father.”
Philip stopped.  Ay, there was the rub—General Custer, and all
that he stood for.  Philip glimpsed momentarily those early
boyhood days with his father, spent mainly in army posts; the
boy’s cavalry uniform, in which he had ridden old Bess about the
camp, waving his miniature sabre; the day he had been thrown to
the ground by a strange horse which he had disobediently mounted,
just as his father arrived on the scene. Philip had never
forgotten his father’s words that day. “Don’t crawl, son,—don’t
whine.  It was your fault this time and you deserved what you
got.  Lots of times it won’t be your fault, but you’ll have to
take your licking anyway. But remember this, son—take your
medicine like a man—always.”
Philip groaned; he knew what the general would say when the news
of his son’s desertion of his wife and four year old boy reached
him. He knew that he never could explain to his father the
absolute torture of the last four years of enervating domesticity
and business mediocrity— the torture of the Beauty within him
crying for expression, half satisfied by the stolen evenings at
the art school but constantly growing stronger in its
all-consuming appeal.  No, life to his father was a simple
problem in army ethics—a problem in which duty was “a”, one of
the known factors; “x,” the unknown, was either “bravery” or
“cowardice” when brought in contact with “a”. Having solved this
problem, his father had closed the book; of the higher
mathematics, and especially of those complex problems to which no
living man knew the final answer, he had no conception. And
yet----
Philip resumed his reading to avoid the old endless maze of
subtleties.
“It is not that I did not—or do not—love you. It is, rather,
that something within me is crying out— something which is
stronger than I, and which I cannot resist. I have waited two
years to be sure.  Yesterday, as soon as I reached here, I took
my work to the man who is considered the finest art critic in
Paris.  He told me that there was a quality to my painting which
he had seen in that of no living artist; he told me that in five
years of hard work I should be able to produce work which
Botticelli would be proud to have done. Do you understand that,
Mary—Botticelli!
“But no, forgive me.  My paean of joy comes strangely in a letter
which should be of abject humility for what must seem to you, to
father, and to all, a cowardly, selfish act of desertion— a
whining failure to face life.  Oh dear, dear Mary if you could
but understand what a hell I have been through—”
Philip took his pen and crossed out the last line so that no one
could read what had been there.
“Materially, of course, you and little George will be better off;
the foolish pride with which I refused to let your parents help
us now no longer stands in their way.  You should have no
difficulty about a divorce.
“You can dispose of my things as you see fit; there is nothing I
care about keeping which I did not bring.
“Again, Mary, I cannot ask you to forgive, or even to understand,
but I do hope that you will believe me when I say that this act
of mine is the most honest thing I have ever done, and that to
have acted out the tragi-comedy in the part of a happy contented
husband would have made of both of our lives a bitter useless
farce.                    Sincerely,                               
         Philip.”
He folded the pages and addressed the envelope.
“Pardon, Monsieur"—a whiff of sulphur came to his nose as the
waiter bent over the table to light the gas above him. “Would
Monsieur like to see the journal?  There is a most amusing story
about---- The bill, Monsieur?  Yes—in a moment.”
Philip glanced nervously through the pages of the Temps.  He was
anxious to get the letter to the post—to have done with
indecision and worry. It would be a blessed relief when the thing
was finally done beyond chance of recall; why couldn’t that
stupid waiter hurry?
On the last page of the newspaper was an item headlined “Recent
News from America.”  Below was a sub-heading “Horrible Massacre
of Soldiers by Indians—Brave Stand of American Troopers.”  He
caught the name “Custer” and read:
“And by his brave death at the hands of the Indians, this gallant
American general has made the name of Custer one which will
forever be associated with courage of the highest type.”
He read it all through again and sat quietly as the hand of
Polyphemus closed over him.  He even smiled a little— a weary,
ironic smile.
“Monsieur desires something more, perhaps"—the waiter held out
the bill.
Philip smiled.  “No—Monsieur has finished—there is nothing
more.”
Then he repeated slowly, “There is nothing more.”
Philip watched his son George blow out the twelve candles on his
birthday cake.
“Mother,” said George, “when I get to be eighteen, can I be a
soldier just like grandfather up there?”  He pointed to the
portrait of Philip’s father in uniform which hung in the dining
room.
“Of course you can, dear,” said his mother.  “But you must be a
brave boy”.
“Grandfather was awful brave, wasn’t he father?” This from little
Mary between mouthfuls of cake.
“Yes, Mary,” Philip answered.  “He was very, very brave.”
“Of course he was,” said George.  “He was an American.”
“Yes,” answered Philip, “That explains it.—he was an
American.”
Mrs. Custer looked up at the portrait of her distinguished
father-in-law.
“You know Philip, I think it must be quite nice to be able to
paint a picture like that.  I’ve often wondered why you never
kept up your art,”
