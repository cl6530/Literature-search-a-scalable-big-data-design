Whenever men spontaneously risk their lives and fortunes in the support of
a particular cause, they are wont to set a high value on their services,
and generally assume the right of expressing their opinions, and of
interfering with their advice. Hence it happened that the dissensions and
animosities in the court and army of the unfortunate monarch were scarcely
less violent or less dangerous than those which divided the parliamentary
leaders. All thought themselves entitled to offices and honours from the
gratitude of the sovereign; no appointment could be made which did not
deceive the expectations, and excite the murmurs, of numerous competitors;
and complaints were everywhere heard, cabals were formed, and the wisest
plans were frequently controlled and defeated, by men who thought
themselves neglected or aggrieved. When Charles, as one obvious remedy,
removed the lord Wilmot from the command of the cavalry, and the lord Percy
from that of the ordnance, he found that he had only aggravated the
evil; and the dissatisfaction of the army was further increased by the
substitution of his nephew Prince Rupert, whose severe and imperious temper
had earned him the general hatred, in the place of Ruthen, who, on account
of his infirmities, had been advised to retire.[1]
Another source of most acrimonious controversy was furnished by the
important question of peace or war, which formed a daily subject of debate
in every company, and divided the royalists into contending parties. Some
there were (few, indeed, in number, and chiefly those whom the two houses
by their votes had excluded from all hopes of pardon) who contended that
the king ought never to lay down his arms till victory should enable him to
give the law to his enemies; but the rest, wearied out with the fatigues
and dangers of war, and alarmed by the present sequestration of their
estates, and the ruin which menaced their families, most anxiously longed
for the restoration of peace. These, however, split into two parties; one
which left the conditions to the wisdom of the monarch; the other which not
only advised, but occasionally talked of compelling a reconciliation, on
almost any terms, pretending that, if once the king were reseated on his
throne, he must quickly recover every prerogative which he might have lost.
As for Charles himself, he had already suffered too much by the war, and
saw too gloomy a prospect before him, to be indifferent to the subject;
but, though he was now prepared to make sacrifices, from which but two
years before he would have recoiled with horror, he had still resolved
never to subscribe to conditions irreconcilable with his honour and
conscience; and in this temper of
[Footnote 1: Clarendon, ii. 482, 513, 554.]
mind he was confirmed by the frequent letters of Henrietta from Paris, who
reminded him of the infamy which he would entail on himself, were he, as
he was daily advised, to betray to the vengeance of the parliament the
Protestant bishops and Catholic royalists, who, trusting to his word,
had ventured their all for his interest.[1] He had now assembled hisparliament for the second time; but the attendance of the members was
scarce, and the inconvenience greater than the benefit. Motions were made
ungrateful to the feelings, and opposed to the real views of the king, who,
to free himself from the more obtrusive and importunate of these advisers,
sent them
[Footnote 1: This is the inference which I have drawn from a careful
perusal of the correspondence between Charles and the queen in his Works,
p. 142-150. Some writers have come to a different conclusion: that he
was insincere, and under the pretence of seeking peace, was in reality
determined to continue the war. That he prepared for the resumption of
hostilities is indeed true, but the reason which he gives to the queen is
satisfactory, “the improbability that this present treaty should produce
a peace, considering the great strange difference (if not contrariety) of
grounds that are betwixt the rebels’ propositions and mine, and that I
cannot alter mine, nor will they ever theirs, until they be out of the hope
to prevail by force” (p. 146). Nor do I see any proof that Charles was
governed, as is pretended, by the queen. He certainly took his resolutions
without consulting her, and, if she sometimes expressed her opinion
respecting them, it was no more than any other woman in a similar situation
would have done. “I have nothing to say, but that you have a care of your
honour; and that, if you have a peace, it may be such as may hold; and if
it fall out otherwise, that you do not abandon those who have served you,
for fear they do forsake you in your need. Also I do not see how you can
be in safety without a regiment of guard; for myself, I think I cannot be,
seeing the malice which they have against me and my religion, of which I
hope you will have a care of both. But in my opinion, religion should
be the last thing upon which you should treat; for if you do agree upon
strictness against the Catholics, it would discourage them to serve you;
and if afterwards there should be no peace, you could never expect succours
either from Ireland, or any other Catholic prince, for they would believe
you would abandon them after you have served yourself” (p. 142, 143).]
into honourable exile, by appointing them[a] to give their attendance on
his queen during her residence in France.[1]
In the last summer the first use which he had made of each successive
advantage, was to renew[b] the offer of opening a negotiation for peace. It
convinced the army of the pacific disposition of their sovereign, and it
threw on the parliament, even among their own adherents, the blame of
continuing the war. At length,[c] after the third message, the houses gave
a tardy and reluctant consent; but it was not before they had received from
Scotland the propositions formerly voted as the only basis of a lasting
reconciliation, had approved of the amendments suggested by their allies,
and had filled up the blanks with the specification of the acts of
parliament to be passed, and with the names of the royalists to be excepted
from the amnesty. It was plain to every intelligent man in either army that
to lay such a foundation of peace was in reality to proclaim perpetual
hostilities.[2] But the king, by the advice of his council, consented to
make it the subject of a treaty, for two ends; to discover whether it was
the resolution of the houses to adhere without any modification to these
high pretensions; and to make the experiment, whether it were not possible
to gain one of the two factions, the Presbyterians or the Independents, or
at least to widen
[Footnote 1: See the letters in Charles’s Works, 142-148. “I may fairly
expect to be chidden by thee for having suffered thee to be vexed by them
(Wilmot being already there, Percy on his way, and Sussex within a few
days of taking his journey), but that I know thou carest not for a little
trouble to free me from great inconvenience."–Ibid. 150.]

[Sidenote c: A.D. 1644. Nov. 23.] the breach between them by furnishing new
causes of dissension.[1]
At Uxbridge, within the parliamentary quarters, the commissioners from the
two parties met each other.[a] Those from the parliament had been commanded
to admit of no deviation from the substance of the propositions already
voted; to confine themselves to the task of showing that their demands were
conformable to reason, and therefore not to be refused; and to insist
that the questions of religion, the militia, and Ireland, should each
be successively debated during the term of three days, and continued in
rotation till twenty days had expired, when, if no agreement were made, the
treaty should terminate. They demanded that episcopacy should be abolished,
and the Directory be substituted in place of the Book of Common Prayer;
that the command of the army and navy should be vested in the two houses,
and intrusted by them to certain commissioners of their own appointment;
and that the cessation in Ireland should be broken, and hostilities
should be immediately renewed. The king’s commissioners replied, that
his conscience would not allow him to consent to the proposed change of
religious worship, but that he was willing to consent to a law restricting
the jurisdiction of the bishops within the narrowest bounds, granting every
reasonable indulgence to tender consciences, and raising on the church
property the sum of one hundred thousand
[Footnote 1: Charles was now persuaded even to address the two houses by
the style of “the Lords and Commons assembled in the parliament of England
at Westminster,” instead of “the Lords and Commons of parliament assembled
at Westminster,” which he had formerly used.–Journals, vii. 91. He says
he would not have done it, if he could have found two in the council to
support him.–Works, 144, Evelyn’s Mem. ii. App. 90. This has been alleged,
but I see not with what reason, as a proof of his insincerity in the
treaty.]
[Sidenote: A.D. 1645. Jan. 30.]
pounds, towards the liquidation of the public debt; that on the subject
of the army and navy he was prepared to make considerable concessions,
provided the power of the sword were, after a certain period, to revert
unimpaired to him and his successors; and that he could not, consistently
with his honour, break the Irish treaty, which he had, after mature
deliberation, subscribed and ratified. Much of the time was spent in
debates respecting the comparative merits of the episcopal and presbyterian
forms of church government, and in charges and recriminations as to the
real authors of the distress and necessity which had led to the cessation
in Ireland. On the twentieth day nothing had been concluded. A proposal
to prolong the negotiation was rejected by the two houses, and the
commissioners returned to London and Oxford.[a] The royalists had, however,
discovered that Vane, St. John, and Prideaux had come to Uxbridge not
so much to treat, as to act the part of spies on the conduct of their
colleagues; and that there existed an irreconcilable difference of opinion
between the two parties, the Presbyterians seeking the restoration
of royalty, provided it could be accomplished with perfect safety to
themselves, and with the legal establishment of their religious worship,
while the Independents sought nothing less than the total downfall of the
throne, and the extinction of the privileges of the nobility.[1]
Both parties again appealed to the sword, but with very different prospects
before them; on the side of the royalists all was lowering and gloomy, on
that of the parliament bright and cheering. The king had
[Footnote 1: See Journals, vii. 163, 166, 169, 174, 181, 195, 211, 231,
239, 242-254; Clarendon, ii. 578-600.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1645. Feb. 22.]
derived but little of that benefit which he expected from the cessation in
Ireland. He dared not withdraw the bulk of his army before he had concluded
a peace with the insurgents; and they, aware of his difficulties, combined
their demands, which he knew not how to grant, with an offer of aid which
he was unwilling to refuse. They demanded freedom of religion, the repeal
of Poyning’s law, a parliamentary settlement of their estates, and a
general amnesty, with this exception, that an inquiry should be instituted
into all acts of violence and bloodshed not consistent with the
acknowledged usages of war, and that the perpetrators should be punished
according to their deserts, without distinction of party or religion. It
was the first article which presented the chief difficulty. The Irish urged
the precedent of Scotland; they asked no more than had been conceded to the
Covenanters; they had certainly as just a claim to the free exercise of
that worship, which had been the national worship for ages, as the Scots
could have, to the exclusive establishment of a form of religion which had
not existed during an entire century. But Charles, in addition to his own
scruples, feared to irritate the prejudices of his Protestant subjects. He
knew that many of his own adherents would deem such a concession an act of
apostasy; and he conjured the Irish deputies not to solicit that which must
prove prejudicial to him, and therefore to themselves: let them previously
enable him to master their common enemies; let them place him in a
condition “to make them happy,” and he assured them on the word of a king,
that he would not “disappoint their just expectations."[1] They were not,
however, to be satisfied
[Footnote 1: Clarendon, Irish Rebellion, 25.]
with vague promises, which might afterwards be interpreted as it suited
the royal convenience; and Charles, to throw the odium of the measure from
himself on his Irish counsellors, transferred the negotiation to Dublin,
to be continued by the new lord lieutenant, the marquess of Ormond. That
nobleman was at first left to his own discretion. He was then authorized
to promise the non-execution of the penal laws for the present, and their
repeal on the restoration of tranquillity; and, lastly, to stipulate for
their immediate repeal, if he could not otherwise subdue the obstinacy, or
remove the jealousy of the insurgents. The treaty at Uxbridge had disclosed
to the eyes of the monarch the abyss which yawned before him; he saw “that
the aim of his adversaries was a total subversion of religion and regal
power;” and he commanded Ormond to conclude the peace whatever it might
cost, provided it should secure the persons and properties of the Irish
Protestants, and the full exercise of the royal authority in the island.[1]
[Footnote 1: Carte’s Ormond, ii. App. xii. xiv. xv. xviii. iii. cccxxxi.
He thus states his reasons to the lord lieutenant:–"It being now manifest
that the English rebels have, as far as in them lies, given the command
of Ireland to the Scots” (they had made Leslie, earl of Leven,
commander-in-chief of all the English as well as Scottish forces in
Ireland), “that their aim is the total subversion of religion and regal
power, and that nothing less will content them, or purchase peace here; I
think myself bound in conscience not to let slip the means of settling that
kingdom (if it may be) fully under my obedience, nor lose that assistance
which I may hope from my Irish subjects, for such scruples as in a less
pressing condition might reasonably be stuck at by me.... If the suspension
of Poining’s act for such bills as shall be agreed upon between you there,
and the present taking away of the penal laws against papists by a law,
will do it, I shall not think it a hard bargain, so that freely and
vigorously they engage themselves in my assistance against my rebels of
England and Scotland, for which no conditions can be too hard, not being
against conscience or honour."–Charles’s Works, 149, 150.]
In Scotland an unexpected but transient diversion had been made in favour
of the royal cause. The earls, afterwards marquesses, of Antrim and
Montrose had met in the court at Oxford. In abilities Montrose was inferior
to few, in ambition to none. The reader is aware that he had originally
fought in the ranks of the Covenanters, but afterwards transferred his
services to Charles, and narrowly escaped the vengeance of his enemies.
Now, that he was again at liberty, he aspired to the glory of restoring
the ascendancy of the royal cause in Scotland. At first all his plans were
defeated by the jealousy or wisdom of Hamilton; but Hamilton gradually
sunk, whilst his rival rose in the esteem of the sovereign.[1] Antrim, his
associate, was weak and capricious, but proud of his imaginary consequence,
and eager to engage in undertakings to which neither his means nor his
talents were equal. He had failed in his original attempt to surprise the
castle of Dublin; and had twice fallen into the hands of the Scots in
Ulster, and twice made his escape; still his loyalty or presumption
was unsubdued, and he had come to Oxford to make a third tender of his
services.
[Footnote 1: When Hamilton arrived at Oxford, Dec. 16, 1643, several
charges were brought against him by the Scottish royalists, which with his
answers may be seen in Burnet, Memoirs, 250-269. Charles pronounced no
opinion; but his suspicions were greatly excited by the deception practised
by Hamilton on the lords of the royal party at the convention, and his
concealment from them of the king’s real intentions. On this account
Hamilton was arrested, and conveyed to Pendennis Castle, in Cornwall,
where he remained a prisoner till the place was taken by the parliamentary
forces. Hamilton’s brother Lanark was also forbidden to appear at court;
and, having received advice that he would be sent to the castle of Ludlow,
made his escape from Oxford to his countrymen in London, and thence
returned to Edinburgh. His offence was, that he, as secretary, had affixed
the royal signet to the proclamation of August 24, calling on all Scotsmen
to arm in support of the new league and covenant.–See p. 36.]
Both Antrim and Montrose professed themselves the personal enemies of
the earl of Argyle, appointed by the Scottish estates lieutenant of the
kingdom; and they speedily arranged a plan, which possessed the double
merit of combining the interest of the king with the gratification of
private revenge. Having obtained the royal commission,[1] Antrim proceeded
to Ulster, raised eleven or fifteen hundred men among his dependants, and
despatched them to the opposite coast of Scotland under the command of his
kinsman Alaster Macdonald, surnamed Colkitto.[2] They landed at Knoydart:
the destruction of their ships in Loch Eishord, by a hostile fleet,
deprived them of the means of returning to Ireland; and Argyle with a
superior force cautiously watched their motions.[a] From the Scottish
royalists they received no aid; yet Macdonald marched as far as Badenoch,
inflicting severe injuries on the Covenanters, but exposed to destruction
from the increasing multitude of his foes. In the mean time, Montrose,
with the rank of lieutenant-general, had unfurled the royal standard at
Dumfries;[b] but with so little success, that he hastily retraced his steps
to Carlisle, where by several daring actions he rendered such services to
the royal cause, that he received the title of marquess from the gratitude
of the king. But the fatal battle of Marston Moor induced him to turn his
thoughts once more towards Scotland;[c] and having ordered his followers to
proceed to Oxford, on
[Footnote 1: He was authorized to treat with the confederate Catholics for
ten thousand men; if their demands were too high, to raise as many men as
he could and send them to the king; to procure the loan of two thousand men
to be landed in Scotland; and to offer Monroe, the Scottish commander, the
rank of earl and a pension of two thousand pounds per annum, if with his
army he would join the royalists. Jan. 20, 1644.–Clarendon Papers, ii.
165.]

the third day he silently withdrew with only two companions, and soon
afterwards reached in the disguise of a groom the foot of the Grampian
Hills. There he received intelligence of the proceedings of Macdonald,
and appointed to join him in Athole.[a] At the castle of Blair, which had
surrendered to the strangers, the two chieftains met: Montrose assumed the
command, published the royal commission, and called on the neighbouring
clans to join the standard of their sovereign. The Scots, who had scorned
to serve under a foreigner, cheerfully obeyed, and to the astonishment of
the Covenanters an army appeared to rise out of the earth in a quarter the
most remote from danger; but it was an army better adapted to the purpose
of predatory invasion than of permanent warfare. Occasionally it swelled to
the amount of several thousands: as often it dwindled to the original band
of Irishmen under Macdonald. These, having no other resource than
their courage, faithfully clung to their gallant commander in all the
vicissitudes of his fortune; the Highlanders, that they might secure their
plunder, frequently left him to flee before the superior multitude of his
foes.
The first who dared to meet the royalists in the field, was the lord Elcho,
whose defeat at Tippermuir gave to the victors the town of Perth, with a
plentiful supply of military stores and provisions.[b] From Perth they
marched towards Aberdeen; the Lord Burley with his army fled at the first
charge; and the pursuers entered the gates with the fugitives.[c] The sack
of the town lasted three days: by the fourth many of the Highlanders had
disappeared with the spoil; and Argyle approached with a superior force.[d]
Montrose, to avoid the enemy, led his followers into Banff, proceeded

[Sidenote d: A.D. 1644. Sept. 19.]
along the right bank of the Spey, crossed the mountains of Badenoch, passed
through Athole into Angus, and after a circuitous march of some hundred
miles, reached and took the castle of Fyvie. There he was overtaken by the
Covenanters, whom he had so long baffled by the rapidity and perplexity of
his movements.[a] But every attempt to force his position on the summit of
a hill was repelled; and on the retirement of the enemy, he announced to
his followers his intention of seeking a safer asylum in the Highlands.
Winter had already set in with severity; and his Lowland associates shrunk
from the dreary prospect before them; but Montrose himself, accompanied by
his more faithful adherents, gained without opposition the braes of Athole.
To Argyle the disappearance of the royalists was a subject of joy.
Disbanding the army, he repaired, after a short visit to Edinburgh, to his
castle of Inverary, where he reposed in security, aware, indeed, of the
hostile projects of Montrose, but trusting to the wide barrier of snows
and mountains which separated him from his enemy. But the royal leader
penetrated through this Alpine wilderness,[b] compelled Argyle to save
himself in an open boat on Loch Tyne, and during six weeks wreaked his
revenge on the domains and the clansmen of the fugitive. At the approach of
Argyle with eleven hundred regular troops, he retired; but suddenly turning
to the left, crossed the mountains, and issuing from Glennevis, surprised
his pursuers at Inverlochy in Lochabar.[c] From his galley in the Frith
Argyle beheld the assault of the enemy, the shock of the combatants, and
the slaughter of at least one half of his whole force.[d] This victory
placed the north of Scotland at the mercy of the conquerors.

[Sidenote c: A.D. 1645. Jan. 28.]
[Sidenote d: A.D. 1645. Feb. 2.]
From Inverlochy they marched to Elgin, and from Elgin to Aberdeen,
ravaging, as they passed, the lands, and burning the houses of the
Covenanters. But at Brechin, Baillie opposed their progress with a[a]
numerous and regular force. Montrose turned in the direction of Dunkeld;
Baillie marched to Perth. The former surprised the opulent town of Dundee;
the latter arrived in time to expel the plunderers. But[b] he pursued in
vain. They regained the Grampian hills, where in security they once more
bade defiance to the whole power of the enemy. Such was the short and
eventful campaign of Montrose. His victories, exaggerated by report, and
embellished by the fancy of the hearers, cast a faint and deceitful lustre
over the declining cause of royalty. But they rendered no other service.
His passage was that of a meteor, scorching every thing in its course.
Wherever he appeared, he inflicted the severest injuries; but he made no
permanent conquest; he taught the Covenanters to tremble at his name,
but he did nothing to arrest that ruin which menaced the throne and its
adherents.[1]
England, however, was the real arena on which the conflict was to be
decided, and in England the king soon found himself unable to cope with his
enemies. He still possessed about one-third of the kingdom. From Oxford he
extended his sway almost without interruption to the extremity of Cornwall:
North and South Wales, with the exception of the castles of Pembroke and
Montgomery, acknowledged his authority; and the royal standard was still
unfurled in several

towns in the midland comities.[1] But his army, under the nominal command
of the prince of Wales, and the real command of Prince Rupert, was
frittered away in a multitude of petty garrisons, and languished in a state
of the most alarming insubordination. The generals, divided into factions,
presumed to disobey the royal orders, and refused to serve under an
adversary or a rival; the officers indulged in every kind of debauchery;
the privates lived at free quarters; and the royal forces made themselves
more terrible to their friends by their licentiousness than to their
enemies by their valour.[2] Their excesses provoked new associations in the
counties of Wilts, Dorset, Devon, Somerset, and Worcester, known by the
denomination of Clubmen, whose primary object was the protection of private
property, and the infliction of summary vengeance on the depredators
belonging to either army. These associations were encouraged and organized
by the neighbouring gentlemen; arms of every description were collected for
their use; and they were known to assemble in numbers of four, six,
and even ten thousand men. Confidence in their own strength, and the
suggestions of their leaders, taught them to extend their views; they
invited the adjoining counties to follow their example, and talked of
putting an end by force to the unnatural war which depopulated the country.
But though they professed to observe the strictest neutrality between the
contending parties, their meetings excited a well-founded jealousy
[Footnote 1: Rushworth, vi. 18-22.]
[Footnote 2: Clarendon, ii. 604, 633, 636, 642, 661, 668. “Good men are so
scandalized at the horrid impiety of our armies, that they will not believe
that God can bless any cause in such hands."–Lord Culpeper to Lord Digby.
Clarendon Papers, ii. 189. Carte’s Ormond, iii. 396, 399.]
on the part of the parliamentary leaders; who, the moment it could be done
without danger, pronounced such associations illegal, and ordered them to
be suppressed by military force.[1]
On the other side, the army of the parliament had been reformed according
to the ordinance. The members of both houses had resigned their
commissions, with the exception of a single individual, the very man with
whom the measure had originated,–Lieutenant-General Cromwell. This by
some writers has been alleged as a proof of the consummate art of that
adventurer, who sought to remove out of his way the men that stood between
him and the object of his ambition; but the truth is, that his continuation
in the command was effected by a succession of events which he could not
possibly have foreseen. He had been sent with Waller to oppose the progress
of the royalists in the west; on his return he was ordered to prevent the
junction of the royal cavalry with the forces under the king; and he then
received a commission to protect the associated counties from insult.
[Footnote 1: Clarendon, ii. 665. Whitelock, March, 4, 11, 15. Rushw. vi.
52, 53, 61, 62. But the best account of the Clubmen is to be found in a
letter from Fairfax to the committee of both kingdoms, preserved in the
Journals of the Lords, vii. 184. They wore white ribbons for a distinction,
prevented, as much as they were able, all hostilities between the soldiers
of the opposite parties, and drew up two petitions in the same words, one
to be presented to the king, the other to the parliament, praying them
to conclude a peace, and in the meantime to withdraw their respective
garrisons out of the country, and pledging themselves to keep possession of
the several forts and castles, and not to surrender them without a joint
commission from both king and parliament. Fairfax observes, that “their
heads had either been in actual service in the king’s army, or were known
favourers of the party. In these two counties, Wilts and Dorset, they are
abundantly more affected to the enemy than to the parliament. I know not
what they may attempt."–Ibid. At length the two houses declared
all persons associating in arms without authority, traitors to the
commonwealth.–Journals, vii. 549.]
While he was employed in this service, the term appointed by the ordinance
approached; but Fairfax expressed his unwillingness to part with so
experienced an officer at such a crisis, and the two houses consented that
he should remain forty days longer with the army. Before they expired, the
great battle of Naseby had been fought: in consequence of the victory the
ordinance was suspended three months in his favour; and afterwards the same
indulgence was reiterated as often as it became necessary.[1]
It was evident that the army had lost nothing by the exclusion of members
of parliament and the change in its organization. The commanders were
selected from those who had already distinguished themselves by the
splendour of their services and their devotion to the cause; the new
regiments were formed of privates, who had served under Essex, Manchester,
and Waller, and care was taken that the majority of both should consist
of that class of religionists denominated Independents. These men were
animated with an enthusiasm of which at the present day we cannot form an
adequate conception. They divided their time between military duties and
prayer; they sang psalms as they advanced to the charge; they called on the
name of the Lord, while they were slaying their enemies. The result showed
that fanaticism furnished a more powerful stimulus than loyalty; the
soldiers of God proved more than a match for the soldiers of the
monarch.[2]
[Footnote 1: Journals, Feb. 27, May 10, June 16, Aug. 8. Lords’ Journ. vii.
420, 535.]
[Footnote 2: Essex, Manchester, and Denbigh reluctantly tendered their
resignations the day before the ordinance passed. The first died in the
course of the next year (Sept. 14); and the houses, to express their
respect for his memory, attended the funeral, and defrayed the expense out
of the public purse.–Lords’ Journals, viii. 508, 533.]
Charles was the first to take the field. He marched from Oxford at the head
of ten thousand men, of whom more than one-half were cavalry; the siege of
Chester[a] was raised at the sole report of his approach; and Leicester, an
important post in possession of the parliament,[b] was taken by storm on
the first assault. Fairfax[c] had appeared with his army before Oxford,
where he expected to be admitted by a party within the walls; but the
intrigue failed, and he received orders to proceed[d] in search of the
king.[1] On the evening of the[e] seventh day his van overtook the rear of
the royalists between Daventry and Harborough. Fairfax and his officers
hailed with joy the prospect of a battle. They longed to refute the bitter
taunts and sinister predictions of their opponents in the two houses; to
prove that want of experience might be supplied by the union of zeal and
talent; and to establish, by a victory over the king, the superiority of
the Independent over the Presbyterian party. Charles, on the contrary,
had sufficient reason to decline an engagement.[2] His numbers had been
diminished by the necessity of leaving a strong garrison in Leicester,
and several reinforcements were still on their march to join the royal
standard. But in the presence of the Roundheads the Cavaliers never
listened to the suggestions of prudence. Early[f] in the morning the royal
army formed in line about a mile south of Harborough. Till eight they
awaited with patience the expected charge of the enemy; but

midnight he had resolved to fight.–See his letter in Evelyn’s Memoirs, ii.

Fairfax refused to move from his strong position near Naseby, and the king,
yielding to the importunity of his officers, gave the word to advance.
Prince Rupert commanded on the right. The enemy fled before him; six pieces
of cannon were taken, and Ireton, the general of the parliamentary horse,
was wounded, and for some time a prisoner in the hands of the victors.[1]
But the lessons of experience had been thrown away upon Rupert. He urged
the pursuit with his characteristic impetuosity, and, as at Marston Moor,
by wandering from the field suffered the victory to be won by the masterly
conduct of Oliver Cromwell.
That commander found himself opposed to a weak body of cavalry under Sir
Marmaduke Langdale. By both the fight was maintained with obstinate valour;
but superiority of numbers enabled the former to press on the flanks of the
royalists, who began to waver, and at last turned their backs and fled.
Cromwell prudently checked the pursuit, and leaving three squadrons to
watch the fugitives, directed the remainder of his force against the rear
of the royal infantry. That body of men, only three thousand five hundred
in number, had hitherto fought with the most heroic valour, and had driven
the enemy’s line, with the exception of one regiment, back on the reserve;
but this unexpected charge broke their spirit; they threw down their arms
and asked for quarter. Charles, who had witnessed their efforts and their
danger, made every exertion to support them; he collected several
[Footnote 1: Ireton was of an ancient family in Nottinghamshire, and bred
to the law. He raised a troop of horse for the parliament at the beginning
of the war, and accepted a captain’s commission in the new-modelled army.

general of the horse, and, at Cromwell’s request, Ireton was made
commissary-general under him.–Journals, vii. 421. Rushworth, vi. 42.]
bodies of horse; he put himself at their head; he called on them to follow
him; he assured them that one more effort would secure the victory. But the
appeal was made in vain. Instead of attending to his prayers and commands,
they fled, and forced him to accompany them. The pursuit was continued with
great slaughter almost to the walls of Leicester; and one hundred females,
some of them ladies of distinguished rank, were put to the sword under the
pretence that they were Irish Catholics. In this fatal battle, fought near
the village of Naseby, the king lost more than three thousand men, nine
thousand stand of arms, his park of artillery, the baggage of the army, and
with it his own cabinet, containing private papers of the first importance.
Out of these the parliament made a collection, which was published, with
remarks, to prove to the nation the falsehoods of Charles, and the justice
of the war.[1]
[Footnote 1: For this battle see Clarendon, ii. 655; Rushworth, vi. 42; and
the Journals, vii. 433-436. May asserts that not more than three hundred
men were killed on the part of the king, and only one hundred on that of
the parliament. The prisoners amounted to five thousand.–May, 77. The
publication of the king’s papers has been severely censured by his friends,
and as warmly defended by the advocates of the parliament. If their
contents were of a nature to justify the conduct of the latter, I see not
on what ground it could be expected that they should be suppressed. The
only complaint which can reasonably be made, and which seems founded in
fact, is that the selection of the papers for the press was made unfairly.
The contents of the cabinet were several days in possession of the
officers, and then submitted to the examination of a committee of the lower
house; by whose advice certain papers were selected and sent to the Lords,
with a suggestion that they should be communicated to the citizens in
a common hall. But the Lords required to see the remainder; twenty-two
additional papers were accordingly produced; but it was at the same time
acknowledged that others were still kept back, because they had not yet
been deciphered. By an order of the Commons the papers were afterwards
printed with a preface contrasting certain passages in them with the king’s
former protestations.–Journals, June 23, 26, 30, July 3, 7; Lords’, vii.
467, 469. Charles himself acknowledges that the publication, as far as it
went, was genuine (Evelyn’s Memoirs, App. 101); but he also maintains that
other papers, which would have served to explain doubtful passages, had
been purposely suppressed.–Clarendon Papers, ii. 187. See Baillie, ii.
136.]
After this disastrous battle, the campaign presented little more than the
last and feeble struggles of an expiring party. Among the royalists hardly
a man could be found who did not pronounce the cause to be desperate; and,
if any made a show of resistance, it was more through the hope of procuring
conditions for themselves, than of benefiting the interests of their
sovereign. Charles himself bore his misfortunes with an air of magnanimity,
which was characterized as obstinacy by the desponding minds of his
followers. As a statesman he acknowledged the hopelessness of his cause; as
a Christian he professed to believe that God would never allow rebellion
to prosper; but, let whatever happen, he at least would act as honour and
conscience called on him to act; his name should not descend to posterity
as the name of a king who had abandoned the cause of God, injured the
rights of his successors, and sacrificed the interests of his faithful
and devoted adherents. From Leicester he retreated[a] to Hereford; from
Hereford to Ragland Castle, the seat of the loyal marquess of Worcester;
and thence to Cardiff, that he might more readily communicate with Prince
Rupert at Bristol. Each day brought him a repetition of the most melancholy
intelligence. Leicester had surrendered almost at the[b] first summons; the
forces under Goring, the only body of royalists deserving the name of an
army, were defeated by Fairfax at Lamport; Bridgewater, hitherto[c] deemed
an impregnable fortress, capitulated after a[d]

short siege; a chain of posts extending from that town to Lime, on the
southern coast, cut off Devonshire and Cornwall, his principal resources,
from all communication with the rest of the kingdom; and, what was still
worse, the dissensions which raged among his officers and partisans in
those counties could not be appeased either by the necessity of providing
for the common safety, or by the presence and authority of the prince of
Wales.[1] To add to his embarrassments, his three[a] fortresses in the
north, Carlisle, Pontefract, and Scarborough,[b] which for eighteen months
had defied all the efforts of the enemy, had now fallen, the first into
the[c] hands of the Scots, the other two into those of the parliament.
Under this accumulation of misfortunes many of his friends, and among them
Rupert himself, hitherto the declared advocate of war, importuned him to
yield to necessity, and to accept the conditions offered by the parliament.
He replied that they viewed[d] the question with the eyes of mere soldiers
and statesmen; but he was a king, and had duties to perform, from which no
change of circumstances, no human power could absolve him,–to preserve
the church, protect his friends, and transmit to his successors the lawful
rights of the crown. God was bound to support his own cause: he might for a
time permit rebels and traitors to prosper, but he would ultimately humble
them before the throne of their sovereign.[2] Under

determination, by the grace of God, never, in any possible circumstances,

Independents, nor to injure his successors by lessening the ecclesiastical
or military power bequeathed to him by his predecessors, nor to forsake
the defence of his friends, who had risked their lives and fortunes in his
quarrel.–Evelyn’s Memoirs, ii. App. 104.]

this persuasion, he pictured to himself the wonderful things to be achieved
by the gallantry of Montrose in Scotland, and looked forward with daily
impatience to the arrival of an imaginary army of twenty thousand men from
Ireland. But from such dreams he was soon awakened by the rapid increase of
disaffection in the population around him, and by the rumoured advance of
the Scots to besiege the city of Hereford. From Cardiff he hastily crossed
the kingdom to Newark. Learning that the Scottish cavalry were in pursuit,
he[a] left Newark, burst into the associated counties, ravaged the lands of
his enemies, took the town of Huntingdon,[b] and at last reached in safety
his court at Oxford.[c] It was not that in this expedition he had in view
any particular object. His utmost ambition was, by wandering from place
to place, to preserve himself from falling into the hands of his enemies
before the winter. In that season the severity of the weather would afford
him sufficient protection, and he doubted not, that against the spring the
victories of Montrose, the pacification of Ireland, and the compassion of
his foreign allies, would enable him to resume hostilities with a powerful
army, and with more flattering prospects of success.[1]
At Oxford Charles heard of the victory gained at Kilsyth, in the
neighbourhood of Stirling, by Montrose, who, if he had been compelled to
retreat from Dundee, was still able to maintain the superiority in the
Highlands. The first who ventured to measure[d] swords with the Scottish
hero was the veteran general

Hurry: but the assailant fled from the conflict at Auldearn, and saved
himself, with the small remnant of his force, within the walls of
Inverness. To Hurry[a] succeeded with similar fortune Baillie, the
commander-in-chief. The battle was fought at Alford, in the shire of
Aberdeen; and few, besides the principal officers and the cavalry, escaped
from the slaughter. A new army of ten thousand men was collected: four days
were spent in fasting and prayer; and the host of God marched to trample
under foot the host of the king. But the experience of their leader was
controlled by the presumption of the committee of estates; and he, in
submission to their orders, marshalled his men in a position near Kilsyth:
his cavalry was broken by the[b] royalists at the first charge; the
infantry fled without a blow, and about five thousand of the fugitives are
said to have perished in the pursuit, which was continued for fourteen
or twenty miles.[1] This victory placed the Lowlands at the mercy of the
conqueror. Glasgow and the neighbouring shires solicited his clemency; the
citizens of Edinburgh sent to him the prisoners who had been condemned for
their adherence to the royal cause; and many of the nobility, hastening
to his standard, accepted commissions to raise forces in the name of the
sovereign. At this news the[c] Scottish cavalry, which, in accordance with
the treaty of “brotherly assistance,” had already advanced to Nottingham,
marched back to the Tweed to protect their own country; and the king on the
third day left Oxford with five thousand men, to drive the infantry

that Montrose ordered his men to throw aside their plaids–vestes
molestiores–and fight in their shirts; an order which has given occasion
to several fanciful conjectures and exaggerations;–See Carte, iv. 538.]

from the siege of Hereford. They did not wait his arrival, and he entered
the city amidst the joyful acclamations of the inhabitants.[1]
But Charles was not long suffered to enjoy his[a] triumph. Full of
confidence, he had marched from Hereford to the relief of Bristol; but at
Ragland Castle learned that it was already in possession of the enemy.
This unexpected stroke quite unnerved him. That a prince of his family, an
officer whose reputation for courage and fidelity was unblemished, should
surrender in the third week of the siege an important city, which he had
promised to maintain for four months, appeared to him incredible. His mind
was agitated with suspicion and jealousy. He knew not whether to attribute
the conduct of his nephew to cowardice, or despondency, or disaffection;
but he foresaw and lamented its baneful influence on the small remnant of
his followers. In the anguish of his mind[b] he revoked the commission
of the prince, and commanded him to quit the kingdom; he instructed the
council to watch his conduct, and on the first sign of disobedience to take
him into custody; and he ordered the arrest of his friend Colonel Legge,
and appointed Sir Thomas Glenham to succeed Legge, as governor of Oxford.
“Tell my sone,” he says in a letter to Nicholas, “that I shall lesse
grieeve to hear that he is knoked in the head, than that he should doe so
meane an act as is the rendering of Bristoll castell and fort upon the
termes it was."[2]

Whilst the king thus mourned over the loss of Bristol, he received still
more disastrous intelligence from Scotland. The victory of Kilsyth had
dissolved the royal army. The Gordons with their followers had returned to
their homes; Colkitto. had led back the Highlanders to their mountains;
and with the remnants not more than six hundred repaired to the borders
to await the arrival of an English force which had been promised, but not
provided, by Charles. In the mean while David Leslie had been detached with
four thousand cavalry from the Scottish army in England. He crossed the
Tweed,[a] proceeded northward, as if he meant to interpose himself between
the enemy and the Highlands; and then returned suddenly to surprise them
in their encampment at Philiphaugh. Montrose spent the night at Selkirk in
preparing despatches for the king; Leslie, who was concealed at no great
distance, crossing the Etrick at dawn, under cover of a dense fog,
charged[b] unexpectedly into the camp of the royalists, who lay in heedless
security on the Haugh. Their leader, with his guard of horse, flew to their
succour; but, after a chivalrous but fruitless effort was compelled
to retire and abandon them to their fate. The greater part had formed
themselves into a compact body, and kept the enemy at bay till their offer
of surrender upon terms had been accepted. But then the ministers loudly
demanded their lives; they pronounced the capitulation sinful, and
therefore void; and had the satisfaction to behold the whole body of
captives massacred in
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1645. Sept. 6.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1645. Sept. 13.]
cold blood, not the men only, but also every woman and child found upon the
Haugh. Nor was this sacrifice sufficient. Forty females, who had made their
escape, and had been secured by the country people, were a few days later
delivered up to the victors, who, in obedience to the decision of the kirk,
put them to death by throwing them from the bridge near Linlithgow into
the river Avon. Afterwards the Scottish parliament approved of their
barbarities, on the pretence that the victims were papists from Ireland;
and passed an ordinance that the “Irische prisoners taken at and after
Philiphaughe, in all the prisons in the kingdom, should be execut without
any assaye or processes conform to the treatey betwixt both kingdoms."[1]
Of the noblemen and gentlemen who fled with Montrose, many were also taken;
and of these few escaped the hands of the executioner: Montrose himself
threaded back his way to the Highlands, where he once more raised the royal
standard, and, with a small force and diminished reputation, continued to
bid defiance to his enemies. At length, in obedience to repeated messages
from the king, he dismissed his followers, and reluctantly withdrew to the
continent.[2] With the defeat of Montrose at Philiphaugh vanished those
brilliant hopes with which the king had consoled himself for his former
losses; but the activity of his enemies allowed him no leisure to indulge
his grief; they had already formed a lodgment within the

suburbs of Chester, and threatened to deprive him of that, the only port by
which he could maintain a communication with Ireland. He hastened to its
relief, and was followed at the distance of a day’s journey by Pointz, a
parliamentary officer. It was the king’s intention[a] that two attacks, one
from the city, the other from the country, should be simultaneously made on
the camp of the besiegers; and with this view he left the greater part of
the royal cavalry at Boutenheath, under Sir Marmaduke Langdale, while he
entered Chester himself with the remainder in the dusk of the evening.
It chanced that Pointz meditated a similar attempt with the aid of the
besiegers, on the force under Langdale; and the singular position of the
armies marked the following day with the most singular vicissitudes of
fortune. Early in the morning[b] the royalists repelled the troops under
Pointz; but a detachment from the camp restored the battle, and forced them
to retire under the walls of the city. Here, with the help of the king’s
guards, they recovered the ascendancy, but suffered themselves in the
pursuit to be entangled among lanes and hedges lined with infantry, by whom
they were thrown into irremediable disorder. Six hundred troopers fell
in the action, more than a thousand obtained quarter, and the rest were
scattered in every direction. The next night Charles repaired to Denbigh,
collected the fugitives around him, and, skilfully avoiding Pointz,
hastened[c] to Bridgenorth, where he was met by his nephew Maurice from the
garrison of Worcester.[1]
The only confidential counsellor who attended the king in this expedition
was Lord Digby. That nobleman,

unfortunately for the interests of his sovereign, had incurred the hatred
of his party: of some, on account of his enmity to prince Rupert; of the
general officers, because he was supposed to sway the royal mind, even in
military matters; and of all who desired peace, because to his advice was
attributed the obstinacy of Charles in continuing the war. It was the
common opinion that the king ought to fix his winter quarters at Worcester;
but Digby, unwilling to be shut up during four months in a city of which
the brother of Rupert was governor, persuaded him to proceed[a] to his
usual asylum at Newark. There, observing that the discontent among the
officers increased, he parted[b] from his sovereign, but on an important
and honourable mission. The northern horse, still amounting to fifteen
hundred men, were persuaded by Langdale to attempt a junction with the
Scottish hero, Montrose, and to accept of Digby as commander-in-chief. The
first achievement of the new general was the complete dispersion of the
parliamentary infantry in the neighbourhood of Doncaster; but in a few
days his own followers were dispersed by Colonel Copley at Sherburne.
They rallied[c] at Skipton, forced their way through Westmoreland and
Cumberland, and penetrated as far as Dumfries, but could nowhere meet with
intelligence of their Scottish friends. Returning to the borders, they
disbanded near Carlisle, the privates retiring to their homes, the officers
transporting themselves to the Isle of Man. Langdale remained at Douglas;
Digby proceeded to the marquess of Ormond in Ireland.
Charles, during his stay at Newark, was made to

[Sidenote c: A.D. 1645. Oct. 15.]
feel that with his good fortune he had lost his authority. His two nephews,
the Lord Gerard, and about twenty other officers, entered his chamber, and,
in rude and insulting language, charged him with ingratitude for their
services, and undue partiality for the traitor Digby. The king lost the
command of his temper, and, with more warmth than he was known to have
betrayed on any other occasion, bade them quit his presence for ever. They
retired, and the next morning received passports to go where they pleased.
But it was now[a] time for the king himself to depart. The enemy’s forces
multiplied around Newark, and the Scots were advancing to join the
blockade. In the dead of the night[b] he stole, with five hundred men, to
Belvoir Castle; thence, with the aid of experienced guides, he threaded the
numerous posts of the enemy; and on the second day reached, for the last
time,[c] the walls of Oxford. Yet if he were there in safety, it was owing
to the policy of the parliament, who deemed it more prudent to reduce the
counties of Devon and Cornwall, the chief asylum of his adherents. For this
purpose Fairfax, with the grand army, sat down before Exeter: Cromwell
had long ago swept away the royal garrisons between that city and the
metropolis.[1]
The reader will have frequently remarked the king’s impatience for the
arrival of military aid from Ireland. It is now time to notice the
intrigue on which he founded his hopes, and the causes which led to his
disappointment. All his efforts to conclude a peace with the insurgents
had failed through the obstinacy of the ancient Irish, who required as an
indispensable

[Sidenote b: A.D. 1645. Nov. 3.]
[Sidenote c: A.D. 1645. Nov. 5.]
condition the legal establishment of their religion.[1] The Catholics, they
alleged, were the people of Ireland; they had now regained many of the
churches, which, not a century before, had been taken from their fathers;
and they could not in honour or conscience resign them to the professors
of another religion. Charles had indulged a hope that the lord lieutenant
would devise some means of satisfying their demand without compromising
the character of his sovereign;[2] but the scruples or caution of
Ormond compelled him to look out for a minister of less timid and more
accommodating disposition, and he soon found one in the Lord Herbert, a
Catholic, and son to the marquess of Worcester. Herbert felt the most
devoted attachment to his sovereign. He had lived with him for twenty years
in habits of intimacy: in conjunction with his father, he had spent above
two hundred thousand pounds in support of the royal cause; and both had
repeatedly and publicly avowed their determination to stand or fall with
the throne. To him, therefore, the king explained his difficulties, his
views, and his wishes. Low as he was sunk, he had yet a sufficient resource
left in the two armies in Ireland. With them he might make head against his
enemies, and re-establish his authority. But unfortunately this powerful
and necessary aid was withheld from him by the obstinacy of the Irish
Catholics, whose demands were such, that, to grant them publicly would
be to forfeit the affection and support of all the Protestants in his
dominions. He knew but of one way to elude the difficulty,–the employment
of a secret and
[Footnote 1: Rinuccini’s MS. Narrative.]
[Footnote 2: See the correspondence in Carte’s Ormond, ii. App. xv. xviii.
xx. xxii.; iii. 372, 387, 401; Charles’s Works, 155.]
confidential minister, whose credit with the Catholics would give weight
to his assurances, and whose loyalty would not refuse to incur danger or
disgrace for the benefit of his sovereign. Herbert cheerfully tendered his
services. It was agreed that he should negotiate with the confederates for
the immediate aid of an army of ten thousand men; that, as the reward
of their willingness to serve the king, he should make to them certain
concessions on the point of religion; that these should be kept secret, as
long as the disclosure might be likely to prejudice the royal interests;
and that Charles, in the case of discovery, should be at liberty to disavow
the proceedings of Herbert, till he might find himself in a situation to
despise the complaints and the malice of his enemies.[1]
For this purpose Herbert (now[a] created earl of Glamorgan) was furnished,
1. with a commission to levy men, to coin money, and to employ the revenues
of the crown for their support; 2. with a warrant[b] to grant on certain
conditions to the Catholics of Ireland such concessions as it was not
prudent for the king or the lieutenant openly to make; 3. with a promise
on the part of Charles to ratify whatever engagements his envoy might
conclude, even if they were contrary to law; 4. and with different letters
for the pope, the nuncio, and the several princes from whom subsidies might
be expected. But care was taken that none of these documents should come to
the knowledge of the council. The commission was not sealed in the usual
manner; the names of the persons to whom the letters were to be addressed
were not inserted; and all the papers were in several respects informal;
for this purpose, that the king might have a plausible pretext to

[Sidenote a: A.D. 1645. Jan. 2.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1645. March 12.]
deny their authenticity in the event of a premature disclosure.[1]
Glamorgan proceeded on his chivalrous mission, and after many adventures
and escapes, landed in safety in Ireland. That he communicated the
substance of his instructions to Ormond, cannot be doubted; and, if there
were aught in his subsequent proceedings of which the lord lieutenant
remained ignorant, that ignorance was affected and voluntary on the part
of Ormond.[2] At Dublin both joined in the negotiation with the Catholic
deputies: from Dublin Glamorgan proceeded to Kilkenny, where the supreme
council, satisfied with his authority, and encouraged by the advice of
Ormond, concluded with him a treaty,[a] by which it was stipulated that the
Catholics should enjoy the public exercise of their religion, and retain
all churches, and the revenues of churches, which were not actually in
possession of the Protestant clergy; and that in return they should,
against a certain day, supply the king with a body of ten thousand armed
men, and should devote two-thirds of the ecclesiastical revenues to his
service during the war.[3]
[Footnote 1: See the authorities in Note (A).]
[Footnote 2: See the same.]
[Footnote 3: Dr. Leyburn, who was sent by the queen to Ireland in 1647,
tells us, on the authority of the nuncio and the bishop of Clogher, “that
my lord of Worcester (Glamorgan) was ready to justify that he had exactly
followed his instructions, and particularly that concerning the lord
lieutenant, whom he had made acquainted with all that he had transacted
with the Irish, of which he could produce proof."–Birch, Inquiry, 322.
Nor will any one doubt it, who attends, to the letter of Ormond to Lord
Muskerry on the 11th of August, just after the arrival of Glamorgan at
Kilkenny, in which, speaking of Glamorgan, he assured him, and through him
the council of the confederates, that he knew “no subject in England upon
whose favour and authority with his majesty they can better rely than upon
his lordship’s, nor ... with whom he (Ormond) would sooner agree for the
benefit of this kingdom."–Birch, 62. And another to Glamorgan himself on
Feb. 11th, in which he says, “Your lordship may securely go on in the
way you have proposed to yourself, to serve the king, without fear of
interruption from me, or so much as inquiring into the means you work
by."–Ibid. 163. See also another letter, of April 6th, in Leland, iii.

[Sidenote a: A.D. 1645. August 25.]
To the surprise of all who were not in the secret, the public treaty now
proceeded with unexpected facility. The only point in debate between the
lord lieutenant and the deputies, respected their demand to be relieved
by act of parliament from all penalties for the performance of the divine
service and the administration of the sacraments, after any other form than
that of the established church. Ormond was aware of their ulterior object:
he became alarmed, and insisted on a proviso, that such article should
not be construed to extend to any service performed, or sacraments
administered, in cathedral or parochial churches. After repeated
discussions, two expedients were suggested; one, that in place of the
disputed article should be substituted another, providing that any
concession with respect to religion which the king might afterwards grant
should be considered as making part of the present treaty; the other, that
no mention should be made of religion at all, but that the lieutenant
should sign a private engagement, not to molest the Catholics in the
possession of those churches which they now held, but leave the question to
the decision of a free parliament. To this both parties assented;[a] and
the deputies returned to Kilkenny to submit the result of the conferences
to the judgment of the general assembly.[1]
But before this, the secret treaty with Glamorgan, which had been concealed
from all but the leading members of the council, had by accident come to
the
[Footnote 1: Compare Carte, i. 548, with Vindiciae Cath. Hib. 11, 13.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1645. Nov. 11.]
knowledge of the parliament. About the middle of October, the titular
archbishop of Tuam was slain in a skirmish[a] between two parties of
Scots and Irish near Sligo; and in the carriage of the prelate were found
duplicates of the whole negotiation. The discovery was kept secret; but at
Christmas Ormond received a copy of these important papers from a friend,
with an intimation that the originals had been for some weeks in possession
of the committee of both nations in London. It was evident that to save the
royal reputation some decisive measure must be immediately taken. A council
was called. Digby, who looked upon himself as the king’s confidential
minister, but had been kept in ignorance of the whole transaction,
commented on it with extreme severity. Glamorgan had been guilty of
unpardonable presumption. Without the permission of the king, or the
privity of the lord lieutenant, he had concluded a treaty with the rebels,
and pledged the king’s name to the observance of conditions pregnant
with the most disastrous consequences. It was an usurpation of the royal
authority; an offence little short of high treason. The accused, faithful
to his trust, made but a feeble defence, and was committed to close
custody. In the despatches from the council to Charles, Digby showed that
he looked on the concealment which had been practised towards him as a
personal affront, and expressed his sentiments with a warmth and freedom
not the most grateful to the royal feelings.[1]
[Footnote 1: Rushworth, vi. 239, 240. Carte’s Ormond, iii. 436-440. “You do
not believe,” writes Hyde to secretary Nicholas, “that my lord Digby
knew of my lord Glamorgan’s commission and negotiation in Ireland. I am
confident he did not; for he shewed me the copies of letters which he had
written to the king upon it, which ought not in good manners to have been
written; and I believe will not be forgiven to him, by those for whose
service they were written."–Clarendon Papers, ii. 346.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1645. Oct. 17.]
The unfortunate monarch was still at Oxford devising new plans and
indulging new hopes. The dissensions among his adversaries had assumed a
character of violence and importance which they had never before borne.
The Scots, irritated by the systematic opposition of the Independents, and
affected delays of the parliament, and founding the justice of their
claim on the solemn league and covenant confirmed by the oaths of the two
nations, insisted on the legal establishment of Presbyterianism, and the
exclusive prohibition of every other form of worship. They still ruled in
the synod of divines; they were seconded by the great body of ministers
in the capital, and by a numerous party among the citizens; and they
confidently called for the aid of the majority in the two houses, as of
their brethren of the same religions persuasion. But their opponents, men
of powerful intellect and invincible spirit, were supported by the swords
and the merits of a conquering army. Cromwell, from the field of Naseby,
had written to express his hope, that the men who had achieved so glorious
a victory might be allowed to serve God according to the dictates of their
consciences. Fairfax, in his despatches, continually pleaded in favour of
toleration. Seldon and Whitelock warned their colleagues to beware how they
erected among them the tyranny of a Presbyterian kirk; and many in the two
houses began to maintain that Christ had established no particular form
of church government, but had left it to be settled under convenient
limitations by the authority of the state.[1] Nor were their
[Footnote 1: Baillie, ii. 111, 161, 169, 183. Rushw. vi. 46, 85. Whitelock,

altercations confined to religious matters. The decline of the royal cause
had elevated the hopes of the English leaders. They no longer disguised
their jealousy of the projects of their Scottish allies; they accused them
of invading the sovereignty of England by placing garrisons in Belfast,
Newcastle, and Carlisle; and complained that their army served to no other
purpose than to plunder the defenceless inhabitants. The Scots haughtily
replied, that the occupation of the fortresses was necessary for their
own safety; and that, if disorders had occasionally been committed by the
soldiers, the blame ought to attach to the negligence or parsimony of those
who had failed in supplying the subsidies to which they were bound by
treaty. The English commissioners remonstrated with the parliament of
Scotland, the Scottish with that of England; the charges were reciprocally
made and repelled in tones of asperity and defiance; and the occurrences
of each day seemed to announce a speedy rupture between the two nations.
Hitherto their ancient animosities had been lulled asleep by the conviction
of their mutual dependence: the removal of the common danger called them
again into activity.[1]
To a mind like that of Charles, eager to multiply experiments, and prone to
believe improbabilities, the hostile position of these parties opened a new
field for intrigue. He persuaded himself that by gaining either, he should
be enabled to destroy both.[2] He therefore tempted the Independents with
promises of ample
[Footnote 1: Journals, vii. 573, 619, 640-643, 653, 668, 689, 697, 703,
viii. 27, 97. Baillie, ii. 161, 162, 166, 171, 185, 188.]
[Footnote 2: “I am not without hope that I shall be able to draw either the
Presbyterians or Independents to side with me for extirpating the one the
other, that I shall be really king again."–Carte’s Ormond, iii. 452.]
rewards and unlimited toleration; and at the same time sought to win the
Scots by professions of his willingness to accede to any terms compatible
with his honour and conscience. Their commissioners in London had already
made overtures for an accommodation to Queen Henrietta in Paris; and the
French monarch, at her suggestion, had intrusted[a] Montreuil with the
delicate office of negotiating secretly between them and their sovereign.
From Montreuil Charles understood that the Scots would afford him an asylum
in their army, and declare in his favour, if he would assent to the three
demands made of him during the treaty at Uxbridge; a proposal which both
Henrietta and the queen regent of France thought so moderate in existing
circumstances, that he would accept it with eagerness and gratitude.
But the king, in his own judgment, gave the preference to a project
of accommodation with the Independents, because they asked only for
toleration, while the Scots sought to force their own creed on the
consciences of others; nor did he seem to comprehend the important fact,
that the latter were willing at least to accept him for their king,
while the former aimed at nothing less than the entire subversion of his
throne.[1]
From Oxford he had sent several messages[b][c][d][e][f][g] to the
parliament, by one of which he demanded passports for commissioners, or
free and safe access for himself. To all a refusal was returned, on the
ground that he had employed the opportunity afforded him by former treaties
to tempt the fidelity of the commissioners, and that it was unsafe to
indulge him with more facilities for conducting similar intrigues. Decency,
however,

required that in return the two houses should make their proposals; and
it was resolved to submit to him certain articles for his immediate and
unqualified approval or rejection. The Scots contended in favour of the
three original propositions; but their opponents introduced several
important alterations, for the twofold purpose, first of spinning out the
debates, till the king should be surrounded in Oxford, and secondly of
making such additions to the severity of the terms as might insure their
rejection.[1]
Under these circumstances Montreuil admonished him that he had not a day to
spare; that the Independents sought to deceive him to his own ruin; that
his only resource was to accept of the conditions offered by the Scots; and
that, whatever might be his persuasion respecting the origin of episcopacy,
he might, in his present distress, conscientiously assent to the demand
respecting Presbyterianism; because it did not require him to introduce a
form of worship which was not already established, but merely to allow that
to remain which he had not the power to remove. Such, according to his
instructions, was the opinion of the queen regent of France, and such was
the prayer of his own consort, Henrietta Maria. But no argument could shake
the royal resolution.[2] He returned[a] a firm but temperate refusal, and
renewed his request for a personal conference at Westminster. The message
was conveyed in terms as energetic as language could supply, but it arrived
at a most unpropitious

[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. Jan. 20.]
moment, the very day on which the committee of both kingdoms thought proper
to communicate to the two houses the papers respecting the treaty between
Glamorgan and the Catholics of Ireland. Amidst the ferment and exasperation
produced by the disclosure, the king’s letter was suffered to remain
unnoticed.[1]
The publication of these important documents imposed[a] on Charles the
necessity of vindicating his conduct to his Protestant subjects; a task of
no very easy execution, had he not availed himself of the permission which
he had formerly extorted from the attachment of Glamorgan. In an additional
message to the two houses, he protested that he had never given to that
nobleman any other commission than to enlist soldiers, nor authorized him
to treat on any subject without the privity of the lord lieutenant; that
he disavowed all his proceedings and engagements with the Catholics of
Ireland; and that he had ordered the privy council in Dublin to proceed
against him for his presumption according to law.[2] That council,
however,[b] or at least the lord lieutenant, was in possession of a
document unknown to the parliament, a copy of the warrant by which Charles
had engaged to confirm whatever Glamorgan should promise in the royal name.
On this account, in his answer to Ormond, he was compelled to shift his
ground, and to assert that he had no recollection of any such warrant;
that it was indeed possible he might have furnished the earl with some
credential to the Irish Catholics; but that if he did, it was only with an
understanding that it should not be employed without the knowledge and the
approbation
[Footnote 1: Clarendon Papers, ii. 213. Journals, viii. 103, 125. Commons’

[Footnote 2: Journals, viii. 132. Charles’s Works, 555.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. Jan. 29.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1646. Jan. 31.]
of the lord lieutenant. Whoever considers the evasive tendency of these
answers, will find in them abundant proof of Glamorgan’s pretentions.[1]
That nobleman had already recovered his liberty. To prepare against
subsequent contingencies, and to leave the king what he termed “a
starting-hole,” he had been careful to subjoin to his treaty a secret
article called a defeasance, stipulating that the sovereign should be no
further bound than he himself might think proper, after he had witnessed
the efforts of the Catholics in his favour; but that Glamorgan should
conceal this release from the royal knowledge till he had made every
exertion in his power to procure the execution of the treaty.[2] This
extraordinary instrument he now produced in his own vindication: the
council ordered him to be discharged upon bail for his appearance when it
might be required; and he[a] hastened under the approbation of the lord
lieutenant, to resume his negotiation with the Catholics at Kilkenny. He
found the general assembly divided into two parties. The clergy, with their
adherents, opposed the adoption of any peace in which the establishment of
the Catholic worship was not openly recognized; and their arguments were
strengthened by the recent imprisonment of Glamorgan, and the secret
influence of the papal nuncio Rinuccini, archbishop and prince of Fermo,
who had lately landed in Ireland. On the other hand, the members of the
council and the lords and gentlemen of the pale strenuously recommended the
adoption of one of the two expedients which have
[Footnote 1: Carte, iii. 445-448.]
[Footnote 2: Compare Carte, i. 551, with the Vindiciae, 17. Neither of
these writers gives us a full copy of the defeasance. In the Vindiciae
we are told that it was this which procured Glamorgan’s discharge from
prison.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. Jan. 22.]
been previously mentioned, as offering sufficient security for the church,
and the only means of uniting the Protestant royalists in the same cause
with the Catholics. At the suggestion of the nuncio, the decision was
postponed to the month of May; but Glamorgan did not forget the necessities
of his sovereign; he obtained an immediate aid of six thousand men, and the
promise of a considerable reinforcement, and proceeded to Waterford for the
purpose of attempting to raise the siege of Chester. There, while he waited
the arrival of transports, he received the news of the public disavowal
of his authority by the king. But this gave him little uneasiness; he
attributed it to the real cause, the danger with which Charles was
threatened; and he had been already instructed “to make no other account of
such declarations, than to put himself in a condition to help his master
and set him free."[1] In a short time the more distressing intelligence
arrived that Chester had surrendered: the fall of Chester was followed by
the dissolution of the royal army in Cornwall, under the command of Lord
Hopton; and the prince of Wales, unable to remain there with safety, fled
first to Scilly and thence to Jersey. There remained not a spot on the
English coast where the Irish auxiliaries could be landed with any prospect
of success. Glamorgan dispersed his army. Three hundred men accompanied
the Lord Digby to form a guard for the prince; a more considerable body
proceeded to Scotland in aid of Montrose; and the remainder returned to
their former quarters.[2]
[Footnote 1: Birch, 189.]
[Footnote 2: Had Glamorgan’s intended army of 10,000 men landed in England,
the war would probably have assumed a most sanguinary character. An
ordinance had passed the houses, that no quarter should be given to any
Irishman, or any papist born in Ireland; that they should be excepted
out of all capitulations; and that whenever they were taken, they should
forthwith be put to death.–Rushworth, v. 729. Oct. 24, 1644. By the navy
this was vigorously executed. The Irish sailors were invariably bound back
to back, and thrown into the sea. At land we read of twelve Irish soldiers
being hanged by the parliamentarians, for whom Prince Rupert hanged twelve
of his prisoners.–Clarendon, ii. 623. After the victory of Naseby, Fairfax
referred the task to the two houses. He had not, he wrote, time to inquire
who were Irish and who were not, but had sent all the prisoners to London,
to be disposed of according to law–Journals, vii. 433.]
In the mean while the king continued to consume his time in unavailing
negotiations with the parliament, the Scots, and the Independents. 1.
He had been persuaded that there were many individuals of considerable
influence both in the city and the two houses, who anxiously wished for
such an accommodation as might heal the wounds of the country: that the
terror inspired by the ruling party imposed silence on them for the
present; but that, were he in London, they would joyfully rally around
him, and by their number and union compel his adversaries to lower their
pretensions. This it was that induced him to solicit a personal conference
at Westminster. He[a] now repeated the proposal, and, to make it worth
acceptance, offered to grant full toleration to every class of Protestant
dissenters, to yield to the parliament the command of the army during seven
years, and to make over to them the next nomination of the lord admiral,
the judges, and the officers of state. The insulting[b] silence with which
this message was treated did not deter him from a third attempt. He asked
whether, if he were to disband his forces, dismantle his garrisons, and
return to his usual residence in the vicinity of the parliament, they, on
their part, would pass their
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. Jan. 29.] [Sidenote b: A.D. 1646. March 23.]
word for the preservation of his honour, person, and estate, and allow his
adherents to live without molestation on their own property. Even this
proposal could not provoke an answer. It was plain that his enemies dare
not trust their adherents in the royal presence; and, fearing that he might
privately make his way into the city, they published an ordinance, that if
the king came within the lines of communication, the officer of the guard
should conduct him to St. James’s, imprison his followers, and allow of
no access to his person[a]; and at the same time they gave notice by
proclamation that all Catholics, and all persons who had borne arms in the
king’s service, should depart within six days, under the penalty of being
proceeded against as spies according to martial law.[1]
2. In the negotiation still pending between Montreuil and the Scottish
commissioners, other matters were easily adjusted; but the question of
religion presented an insurmountable difficulty, the Scots insisting that
the presbyterian form of church government should be established in all the
three kingdoms; the king consenting that it should retain the supremacy in
Scotland, but refusing to consent to the abolition of episcopacy in England
and Ireland.[2] To give a colour to the agency of Montreuil, Louis had
appointed him the French resident in Scotland, and in that capacity he
applied for permission to pass through Oxford on his way, that he might
deliver to the king letters from his sovereign and the queen regent.[b]
Objections were made; delays were created; but after the lapse of a
fortnight, he obtained a passport[c]
[Footnote 1: Charles’s Works, 556, 557. Rushworth, vi. 249. Journals, March
31, 1646. Carte’s Ormond, iii. 452.]

[Sidenote c: A.D. 1646. March 7.]
from the committee of the two kingdoms,[1] and employed his time at Oxford
in persuading Charles of the necessity of concession, and in soliciting
from the Scottish commissioners authority to assure their sovereign of
safety as to person and conscience in the Scottish army. On the first of
April he received from[a] Charles a written engagement, that he would take
with him to their quarters before Newark “no man excepted by parliament,
but only his nephews and Ashburnham,” and that he would then listen to
instruction in the matter of religion, and concede as far as his conscience
would permit.[2] In return, Montreuil pledged to him the word of his
sovereign and the queen regent of France,[3] that the Scots should receive
him as their natural king, should offer no violence to his person or
conscience, his servants or followers, and should join their forces and
endeavours with his to procure “a happy and well-grounded peace.” On this
understanding it was agreed that the king should attempt on the night of
the following Tuesday to break through the parliamentary force lying round
Oxford, and that at the same time a body of three hundred Scottish cavalry
should advance as far as Harborough to receive him, and escort him in
safety to their own army.[4]
[Footnote 1: Lords’ Journ. viii. 171. Commons’, Feb. 16, 28, March 4, 5,

[Footnote 2: Of this paper there were two copies, one to be kept secret,
containing a protestation that none of the king’s followers should
be ruined or dishonoured; the other to be shown, containing no such
protestation. “En l’un desquels, qui m’a esté donné pour faire voir,
la protestation n’estoit point. Faite à Oxford ce premier Avril,
1646."–Clarend. Papers ii. 220.]
[Footnote 3: Why so? It had been so settled in Paris, because the
negotiation was opened under their auspices, and conducted by their
agent.–Clarend. Hist. ii. 750. Papers, ii. 209.]
[Footnote 4: Ibid. 220-222. It had been asked whether Montreuil had any
authority from the Scottish commissioners to make such an engagement. I see
no reason to doubt it. Both Charles and Montreuil must have been aware that
an unauthorized engagement could have offered no security to the king in
the hazardous attempt which he meditated. We find him twice, before the
date of the engagement, requiring the commissioners to send powers to
Montreuil to assure him of safety in person and conscience in their army
(Clarendon Pap. ii. 218), and immediately afterwards informing Ormond that
he was going to the Scottish army because he had lately received “very good
security” that he and his friends should be safe in person, honour, and
conscience. See the letter in Lords’ Journals, viii. 366, and account of a
letter from the king to Lord Belasyse in pys, ii. 246.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. April 1.]
Two days later Montreuil resumed his pretended journey to Scotland, and
repaired to Southwell, within the quarters assigned to the Scots. That they
might without inconvenience spare a large escort to meet the[a] king, he
had brought with him a royal order to Lord Belasyse to surrender Newark
into their hands; but, to his surprise and dismay, he found that the
commissioners to the army affected to be ignorant of the authority
exercised by him at Oxford, and refused to take upon themselves the
responsibility of meeting and receiving the king. They objected that it
would be an act of hostility towards the parliament, a breach of the solemn
league and covenant between the nations: nor would they even allow him
to inform Charles of their refusal, till they should have a personal
conference with their commissioners in London. In these circumstances he
burnt the order for the surrender of Newark; and the king, alarmed at his
unaccountable silence, made no attempt to escape from Oxford. A fortnight
was passed in painful suspense. At last the two bodies of commissioners
met[b] at Royston; and the result of a long debate was a sort of compromise
between the opposite parties that the king should he received, but in such
manner that all appearance of previous treaty or concert might be
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. April 3.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1646. April 11.]
avoided; that he should be requested to give satisfaction on the question
of religion as speedily as possible, and that no co-operation of the royal
forces with the Scots should be permitted. At first Montreuil, in the
anguish of disappointment, was of opinion that no faith was to be put in
the word of a Scotsman: now he thought that he discovered a gleam of[a]
hope in the resolution taken at Royston, and advised[b] the king to accept
the proposal, if no better expedient[c] could be devised. It held out a
prospect of safety, though it promised nothing more.[1]
3. During this negotiation the unfortunate monarch, though warned that, by
treating at the same time with two opposite parties, he ran the risk
of forfeiting the confidence of both, had employed Ashburnham to make
proposals to the Independents through Sir Henry Vane. What the king asked
from them was to facilitate his access to parliament. Ample rewards were
held out to Vane, “to the gentleman, who was quartered[d] with him,"[2] and
to the personal friends of both; and an assurance was given, that if the
establishment of Presbyterianism were still made an indispensable condition
of peace, the king would join his efforts with theirs “to root out of the
kingdom that tyrannical government.” From the remains of the correspondence
it appears that to the first communication Vane had replied in terms
which, though not altogether satisfactory, did not exclude the hope of his
compliance; and Charles wrote to him a second time,
[Footnote 1: These particulars appear in the correspondence in Clarendon
Papers, 221-226. Montreuil left Oxford on Friday; therefore on the 3rd.]
[Footnote 2: This gentleman might be Fairfax or Cromwell; but from a letter
of Baillie (ii. 199, App. 3), I should think that he was an “Independent
minister,” probably Peters.]

[Sidenote c: A.D. 1646. April 20.]
[Sidenote d: A.D. 1646. March 2.]
repeating his offers, describing his distress, and stating that, unless he
received a favourable answer within four days, he must have recourse to
some other expedient.[1] The negotiation, however, continued for weeks; it
was even discovered by the opposite party, who considered it as an artful
scheme on the part of[a] the Independents to detain the king in Oxford,
till Fairfax and Cromwell should bring up the army from Cornwall; to amuse
the royal bird, till the fowlers had enclosed him in their toils.[2]
Oxford during the war had been rendered one of the strongest fortresses
in the kingdom. On three sides the waters of the Isis and the Charwell,
spreading over the adjoining country, kept the enemy at a considerable
distance, and on the north the city was covered with a succession of works,
erected by the most skilful engineers. With a garrison of five thousand
men, and a plentiful supply of stores and provisions, Charles might have
protracted his fate for several months; yet the result of a siege must have
been his captivity. He possessed no army; he had no prospect of assistance
from without; and within, famine would in the end compel him to surrender.
But where was he to seek an asylum?
[Footnote 1: See two letters, one of March 2, from Ashburnham, beginning,
“Sir, you cannot suppose the work is done,” and another without date from
Charles, beginning, “Sir, I shall only add this word to what was said in my
last.” They were first published from the papers of secretary Nicholas, by
Birch, in 1764, in the preface to a collection of “Letters between Colonel
Hammond and the committee at Derby House, &c.,” and afterwards in the
Clarendon Papers, ii. 226, 227.]
[Footnote 2: See Baillie, App. 3, App. 23, ii. 199, 203. “Their daily
treaties with Ashburnham to keep the king still, till they deliver him to
Sir Thomas Fairfax, and to be disposed upon as Cromwell and his friend
think it fittest for their affairs."–Ibid. A different account is given in
the continuation of Macintosh, vi. 21.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. April 23.]
Indignant at what he deemed a breach of faith in the Scots, he spurned the
idea of throwing himself on[a] their mercy; and the march of Fairfax with
the advanced guard of his army towards Andover admonished him that it was
time to quit the city of Oxford. First he inquired by two officers the
opinion of Ireton, who[b] was quartered at Waterstock, whether, if he were
to disband his forces, and to repair to the general, the parliament would
suffer him to retain the title and authority of king. Then, receiving no
answer[c] from Ireton, he authorized the earl of Southampton to state to
Colonel Rainborowe, that the king was ready to deliver himself up to
the army, on receiving a pledge that his personal safety should be
respected.[1] But Rainborowe referred him to the parliament; and the
unhappy monarch, having exhausted every expedient which he could devise,
left Oxford at midnight,[d] disguised as a servant, following his supposed
master[e] Ashburnham, who rode before in company with Hudson, a clergyman,
well acquainted with the country. They passed through Henley and Brentford
to Harrow; but the time which was spent on the road proved either that
Charles had hitherto formed no plan in his own mind, or that he lingered
with the hope of some communication from his partisans in the metropolis.
At last he turned in the direction of St. Alban’s; and, avoiding that town,
hastened through bye-ways to Harborough. If he expected to find there
a body of[f] Scottish horse, or a messenger from Montreuil, he was
disappointed. Crossing by Stamford, he rested at Downham,[g] and spent two
or three days in fruitless inquiries for a ship which might convey him to
Newcastle or Scotland, whilst Hudson repaired to the French agent

at Southwell, and returned the bearer of a short note sent by Montreuil,
from whom the messenger understood that the Scots had pledged their
word–they would give no written document–to fulfill on their part the
original engagement made in their name at Oxford.[1] On this slender
security–for he had no[a] alternative–he repaired to the lodgings of
Montreuil early in the morning, and about noon was conducted by a troop of
horse to the head quarters at Kelham. Leslie and his officers, though they
affected the utmost surprise, treated him with the respect due to their
sovereign; and London in the name of the commissioners required that he
should take the covenant, should order Lord Belasyse to surrender Newark,
and should despatch a messenger with the royal command to Montrose to lay
down his arms. Charles soon discovered that he was a prisoner, and when,
to make the experiment, he undertook to give the word to the guard, he was
interrupted by Leven, who said: “I am the older soldier, sir: your majesty
had better leave that office to me.”
For ten days the public mind in the capital had been
[Footnote 1: The Scots had made three offers or promises to the king. The
first and most important was the engagement of the 1st of April. But the
Scottish commissioners with the army shrunk from the responsibility of
carrying it into execution; and, as it appears to me, with some reason,
for they had not been parties to the contract. The second was the modified
offer agreed upon by both bodies of commissioners at Royston. But this
offer was never accepted by the king, and consequently ceased to be binding
upon them. The third was the verbal promise mentioned above. If it was
made–and of a promise of safety there can be no doubt, though we have only
the testimony of Hudson–the Scots were certainly bound by it, and must
plead guilty to the charge of breach of faith, by subsequently delivering
up the fugitive monarch to the English parliament.]

agitated by the most contradictory rumours: the moment the place of the
king’s retreat was ascertained, both Presbyterians and Independents united
in condemning the perfidy of their northern allies. Menaces of immediate
hostilities were heard. Poyntz received orders to watch the motions of the
Scots with five thousand horse; and it was resolved that Fairfax should
follow with the remainder of the army. But the Scottish leaders, anxious to
avoid a rupture, and yet unwilling to surrender the royal prize, broke up
their camp before Newark, and retired with precipitation to Newcastle.
Thence by dint of protestations and denials they gradually succeeded in
allaying the ferment.[1] Charles contributed his share, by repeating his
desire of an accommodation, and requesting the two houses to send to
him the propositions of peace; and, as an earnest of his sincerity, he
despatched a circular order[a] to his officers to surrender the few
fortresses which still maintained his cause. The war was at an end; Oxford,
Worcester, Pendennis, and Ragland opened[b] their gates; and to the praise
of the conquerors it must be recorded, that they did not stain their
laurels with blood. The last remnants of the royal army obtained honourable
terms from the generosity of Fairfax; easy compositions for the redemption
of their estates were held out to the great majority of the

astonished at the king’s coming to their army; that they believed he must
mean to give satisfaction, or he would never have come to them; that his
presence would never induce them to act in opposition to the solemn league
and covenant; that they should leave the settlement of all questions to the
parliaments of the two nations; that there had been no treaty between the
king and them; and that the assertion in the letter published by Ormond was
“a damnable untruth."]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. June 10.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1646. August 20.]
royalists; and the policy of the measure was proved by the number of those
who hastened to profit by the indulgence, and thus extinguished the hopes
of the few who still thought it possible to conjure up another army in
defence of the captive monarch.[1]
While the two houses, secure of victory, debated at their leisure the
propositions to be submitted for acceptance to the king, the Scots employed
the interval in attempts to convert him to the Presbyterian creed. For this
purpose, Henderson, the most celebrated of their ministers, repaired from
London to Newcastle. The king, according to his promise, listened to the
arguments of his new instructor; and an interesting controversy respecting
the divine institution of episcopacy and presbyteracy was maintained with
no contemptible display of skill between the two polemics. Whether Charles
composed without the help of a theological monitor the papers, which on
this occasion he produced, may perhaps be doubted; but the author whoever
he were, proved himself a match, if not more than a match, for his veteran
opponent.[2] The Scottish

standard was the marquess of Worcester. He was compelled to travel, at the
age of eighty, from Ragland Castle to London, but died immediately after
his arrival. As his estate was under sequestration, the Lords ordered a sum
to be advanced for the expenses of his funeral.–Journals, viii. 498, 616.
See Note (B) at the end of the volume.]
[Footnote 2: The following was the chief point in dispute. Each had alleged
texts of Scripture in support of his favourite opinion, and each explained
those texts in an opposite meaning. It was certainly as unreasonable that
Charles should submit his judgment to Henderson, as that Henderson should
submit his to that of Charles. The king, therefore, asked who was to be
judge between them. The divine replied, that Scripture could only be
explained by Scripture, which, in the opinion of the monarch, was leaving
the matter undecided. He maintained that antiquity was the judge. The
church government established by the apostles must have been consonant to
the meaning of the Scripture. Now, as far as we can go back in history, we
find episcopacy established: whence it is fair to infer that episcopacy
was the form established by the apostles. Henderson did not allow the
inference. The church of the Jews had fallen into idolatry during the short
absence of Moses on the mount, the church of Christ might have fallen into
error in a short time after the death of the apostles. Here the controversy
ended with the sickness and death of the divine.–See Charles’s Works,
75-90.]
leaders, however, came with political arguments to the aid of their
champion. They assured[a] the king that his restoration to the royal
authority, or his perpetual exclusion from the throne, depended on his
present choice. Let him take the covenant, and concur in the establishment
of the Directory, and the Scottish nation to a man, the English, with
the sole exception of the Independents, would declare in his favour. His
conformity in that point alone could induce them to mitigate the severity
of their other demands, to replace him on the throne of his ancestors,
and to compel the opposite faction to submit. Should he refuse, he must
attribute the consequences to himself. He had received sufficient warning:
they had taken the covenant, and must discharge their duty to God and their
country.
It was believed then, it has often been repeated since, that the king’s
refusal originated in the wilfulness and obstinacy of his temper; and that
his repeated appeals to his conscience were mere pretexts to disguise his
design of replunging the nation into the horrors from which it had so
recently emerged. But this supposition is completely refuted by the whole
tenour of his secret correspondence with his queen and her council in
France. He appears to have divided his objections into two classes,
political and religious. 1. It was, he alleged, an age in which mankind
were governed from the pulpit: whence it became an object
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. July 13.]
of the first importance to a sovereign to determine to whose care that
powerful engine should be intrusted. The principles of Presbyterianism
were anti-monarchical; its ministers openly advocated the lawfulness
of rebellion; and, if they were made the sole dispensers of public
instruction, he and his successors might be kings in name, but would be
slaves in effect. The wisest of those who had swayed the sceptre since the
days of Solomon had given his sanction to the maxim “no bishop no king;"
and his own history furnished a melancholy confirmation of the sagacity of
his father. 2. The origin of episcopacy was a theological question, which
he had made it his business to study. He was convinced that the institution
was derived from Christ, and that he could not in conscience commute it for
another form of church government devised by man. He had found episcopacy
in the church at his accession; he had sworn to maintain it in all its
rights; and he was bound to leave it in existence at his death. Once,
indeed, to please the two houses, he had betrayed his conscience by
assenting to the death of Strafford: the punishment of that transgression
still lay heavy on his head; but should he, to please them again, betray it
once more, he would prove himself a most incorrigible sinner, and deserve
the curse both of God and man.[1]
The king had reached Newark in May: it was the end of July before the
propositions of peace were submitted[a] to his consideration. The same in
substance with those of the preceding year, they had yet been aggravated by
new restraints, and a more numerous

[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. July 24.]
list of proscriptions. On the tenth day,[a] the utmost limit of the time
allotted to the commissioners, Charles replied that it was impossible
for him to return an unqualified assent to proposals of such immense
importance; that without explanation he could not comprehend how much of
the ancient constitution it was meant to preserve, how much to take away;
that a personal conference was necessary for both parties, in order to
remove doubts, weigh reasons, and come to a perfect understanding; and that
for this purpose it was his intention to repair to Westminster whenever the
two houses and the Scottish commissioners would assure him that he might
reside there with freedom, honour, and safety.[1]
This message, which was deemed evasive, and therefore unsatisfactory,
filled the Independents with joy, the Presbyterians with sorrow. The former
disguised no longer their wish to dethrone the king, and either to set up
in his place his son the duke of York, whom the surrender of Oxford had
delivered into their hands, or, which to many seemed preferable, to
substitute a republican for a monarchical form of government. The Scottish
commissioners sought to allay the ferment, by diverting the attention of
the houses. They expressed[b] their readiness not only to concur in such
measures as the obstinacy of the king should make necessary, but on the
receipt of a compensation for their past services, to withdraw their army
into their own country. The offer was cheerfully accepted; a committee
assembled to balance the accounts between

the nations; many charges on both sides were disputed and disallowed; and
at last the Scots agreed[a] to accept four hundred thousand pounds in lieu
of all demands, of which one half should be paid before they left England,
the other after their arrival in Scotland.[1]
At this moment an unexpected vote[b] of the two houses gave birth to a
controversy unprecedented in history. It was resolved that the right of
disposing of the king belonged to the parliament of England. The Scots
hastened to remonstrate. To dispose of the king was an ambiguous term;
they would assume that it meant to determine where he should reside until
harmony was restored between him and his people. But it ought to be
remembered that he was king of Scotland as well as of England; that each
nation had an interest in the royal person; both had been parties in the
war; both had a right to be consulted respecting the result. The
English, on the contrary, contended that the Scots were not parties, but
auxiliaries, and that it was their duty to execute the orders of those
whose bread they ate, and whose money they received. Scotland was certainly
an independent kingdom. But its rights were confined within its own
[Footnote 1: Journals, viii. 461, 485. Baillie, ii. 222, 223, 225, 267.
Rush. vi. 322-326. To procure the money, a new loan was raised in the
following manner. Every subscriber to former loans on the faith of
parliament, who had yet received neither principal nor interest, was
allowed to subscribe the same sum to the present loan, and, in return, both
sums with interest were to be secured to him on the grand excise and the
sale of the bishops’ lands. For the latter purpose, three ordinances were
passed; one disabling all persons from holding the place, assuming the
name, and exercising the jurisdiction of archbishops or bishops within the
realm, and vesting all the lands belonging to archbishops and bishops
in certain trustees, for the use of the nation (Journals, 515); another
securing the debts of subscribers on these lands (ibid. 520); and a
third appointing persons to make contracts of sale, and receive the
money.–Journals of Commons, Nov. 16.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. Sept. 5.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1646. Sept. 21.]
limits; it could not claim, it should not exercise, any authority within
the boundaries of England. This altercation threatened to dissolve the
union between the kingdoms. Conferences were repeatedly[a][b] held. The
Scots published their speeches; the Commons ordered the books to be seized,
and the printers to be imprisoned; and each party obstinately refused
either to admit the pretensions of its opponents, or even to yield to
a compromise. But that which most strongly marked the sense of the
parliament, was a vote[c] providing money for the payment of the army
during the next six months; a very intelligible hint of their determination
to maintain their claim by force of arms, if it were invaded by the
presumption of their allies.[1]
This extraordinary dispute, the difficulty of raising an immediate loan,
and the previous arrangements for the departure of the Scots, occupied the
attention of the two houses during the remainder of the year. Charles
had sufficient leisure to reflect on the fate which threatened him. His
constancy seemed to relax; he consulted[d] the bishops of London and
Salisbury: and successively proposed several unsatisfactory expedients,
of which the object was to combine the toleration of episcopacy with the
temporary or partial establishment of Presbyterianism. The lords voted[e]
that he should be allowed to reside at Newmarket; but the Commons
refused[f] their consent; and ultimately both houses fixed on Holmby, in
the vicinity of Northampton.[2] No notice was taken of the security

which he had demanded for his honour and freedom, but a promise was given
that respect should be had to the safety of his person in the defence of
the true[a] religion and the liberties of the two kingdoms, according to
the solemn league and covenant. This vote was communicated to the Scottish
commissioners at Newcastle, who replied that they awaited the commands[b]
of their own parliament.[1]
In Scotland the situation of the king had been the subject of many keen
and animated debates. In the parliament his friends were active
and persevering; and their efforts elicited a resolution that the
commissioners[c] in London should urge with all their influence his request
of a personal conference. Cheered by this partial success, they proposed a
vote expressive of their determination to support, under all circumstances,
his right to the English throne. But at this moment arrived the votes of
the two houses for his removal to Holmby: the current of Scottish loyalty
was instantly checked; and the fear of a rupture between the nations
induced the estates to observe a solemn fast, that they might deserve the
blessing of Heaven, and to consult the commissioners of the kirk, that they
might proceed with a safe conscience. The answer was such as might have
been expected from the bigotry of the age: that it was unlawful to assist
in the restoration of a prince, who had been excluded from the government
of his kingdom, for his refusal of the propositions respecting religion
and the covenant. No man ventured to oppose the decision of the kirk. In a
house of two hundred

members, not more than seven or eight were found to speak in favour of
their sovereign. A resolution was voted that he should be sent to Holmby,
or some other of his houses near London, to remain there till he had
assented to the propositions of peace; and all that his friends could
obtain was an amendment more expressive of their fears than of their hopes,
that no injury[a] or violence should be offered to his person, no obstacle
be opposed to the legitimate succession of his children, and no alteration
made in the existing government of the kingdoms. This addition was
cheerfully adopted by the English House of Lords; but the Commons did not
vouchsafe to honour it with their notice. The first[b] payment of one
hundred thousand pounds had already been made at Northallerton: the Scots,
according to[c] agreement, evacuated Newcastle; and the parliamentary
commissioners, without any other ceremony, took charge of the royal person.
Four days later the Scots[d] received the second sum of one hundred
thousand pounds; their army repassed the border-line between the two
kingdoms; and the captive monarch, under a[e] strong guard, but with every
demonstration of respect, was conducted to his new prison at Holmby.[1]
The royalists, ever since the king’s visit to Newark, had viewed with
anxiety and terror the cool calculating policy of the Scots. The result
converted their suspicions into certitude: they hesitated not to accuse
them of falsehood and perfidy, and to charge them with having allured the
king to their army by deceitful promises, that, Judas-like, they might
barter him for money with his enemies. Insinuations so injurious

to the character of the nation ought not to be lightly admitted. It is,
indeed, true that fanaticism and self-interest had steeled the breasts
of the Covenanters against the more generous impulses of loyalty and
compassion; and that, by the delivery of the king to his enemies, they
violated their previous pledge of personal safety, which, if once given,
though by word only, ought to have been sacredly fulfilled. But there is
no ground for the statement, that they held out promises to delude the
unfortunate prince. It was with reluctance that they consented to receive
him at all; and, when at last he sought an asylum in their army, he came
thither, not allured by invitation from them, but driven by necessity and
despair. 2. If the delivery of the royal person, connected as it was with
the receipt of £200,000, bore the appearance of a sale, it ought to be
remembered, that the accounts between the two nations had been adjusted in
the beginning of September; that for four months afterwards the Scots never
ceased to negotiate in favour of Charles; nor did they resign the care of
his person, till the votes of the English parliament compelled them to make
the choice between compliance or war. It may be, that in forming their
decision their personal interest was not forgotten; but there was another
consideration which had no small weight even with the friends of the
monarch. It was urged that by suffering the king to reside at Holmby, they
would do away with the last pretext for keeping on foot the army under
the command of Fairfax; the dissolution of that army would annihilate the
influence of the Independents, and give an undisputed ascendancy to the
Presbyterians; the first the declared enemies, the others the avowed
advocates of Scotland, of the kirk, and of the king; and the necessary
consequence must be, that the two parliaments would be left at liberty
to arrange, in conformity with the covenant, both the establishment of
religion and the restoration of the throne.[1]
Charles was not yet weaned from the expectation of succour from Ireland.
At Newcastle he had consoled the hours of his captivity with dreams of the
mighty efforts for his deliverance, which would be made by Ormond, and
Glamorgan, and the council at Kilkenny. To the first of these he forwarded
two messages, one openly through Lanark, the Scottish secretary, the other
clandestinely through Lord Digby, who proceeded to Dublin from France. By
the first Ormond received a positive command to break off the treaty
with the Catholics; by the second he was told to adhere to his former
instructions, and to obey no order which was not transmitted to him by the
queen or the prince.[a] The letter to Glamorgan proves more clearly the
distress to which he was reduced, and the confidence which he reposed in
the exertions of that nobleman. “If,” he writes, “you can raise a large sum
of money by pawning my kingdoms for that purpose, I am content you should
do it; and if I recover them, I will fully repay that money. And tell the
nuncio, that if once I can come into his and your hands, which ought to be
extremely wish’d”

Scottish commissioners, to the English parliament, Journals, ix. 594, 598.
“Stapleton and Hollis, and some others of the eleven members, had been the
main persuaders of us to remove out of England, and leave the king to them,

get that evil army disbanded, the king and peace settled according to our
minds; but their bent execution of this real intention has undone them, and
all, till God provide a remedy."–Baillie, ii. 257.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. July 20.]
for by you, both, as well for the sake of England as Ireland, since all the
rest, as I see, despise me, I will do it. And if I do not say this from my
heart, or if in any future time I fail you in this, may God never restore
me to my kingdoms in this world, nor give me eternal happiness in the next,
to which I hope this tribulation will conduct me at last, after I have
satisfied my obligations to my friends, to none of whom am I so much
obliged as to yourself, whose merits towards me exceed all expressions that

But religion was still the rock on which the royal hopes were destined[a]
to split. The perseverance of the supreme council at Kilkenny prevailed
in appearance over the intrigues of the nuncio and the opposition of the
clergy. The peace was reciprocally signed; it was published with more than
usual parade in the cities of Dublin and Kilkenny; but at the same time a
national synod at Waterford not only condemned it[b] as contrary to the
oath of association, but on that ground excommunicated its authors,
fautors, and abettors as guilty of perjury. The struggle between the
advocates and opponents of the peace was soon terminated. The men of
Ulster under Owen O’Neil, proud of their recent victory (they had almost

be expected from such a man.” If the reader peruse Mr. Partington’s recent

the Scottish army in the sanguinary battle of Benburb), espoused the cause
of the clergy; Preston, who commanded the forces of Leinster, after some
hesitation, declared also in their favour; the members of the old council
who had subscribed the treaty were imprisoned, and a new council was
established, consisting of eight laymen and four clergymen, with the nuncio
at their head. Under their direction, the two armies marched to besiege
Dublin: it was saved by the prudence of Ormond, who had wasted the
neighbouring country, and by the habits of jealousy and dissension which
prevented any cordial co-operation between O’Neil and Preston, the one
of Irish, the other of English descent. Ormond, however, despaired of
preserving the capital against their repeated attempts; and the important
question for his decision was, whether he should surrender it to them or to
the parliament. The one savoured of perfidy to his religion, the other[a]
of treachery to his sovereign. He preferred the latter. The first answer to
his offer he was induced to reject as derogatory from his honour: a second
negotiation followed; and he at last consented to resign to the parliament
the sword, the emblem of his office, the[b] castle of Dublin, and all the
fortresses held by his troops, on the payment of a certain sum of money, a
grant of security for his person, and the restoration of his lands, which
had been sequestrated. This agreement was performed. Ormond came to
England, and the king’s hope of assistance from Ireland was once more
disappointed.[1]

[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. Oct. 14.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1647. Feb. 22.]
proper to notice the progress which had been made in the reformation of
religion. From the directory for public worship, the synod and the houses
proceeded to the government of the church. They divided the kingdom into
provinces, the provinces into classes, and the classes into presbyteries
or elderships; and established by successive votes a regular gradation of
authority among these new judicatories, which amounted, if we may believe
the ordinance, to no fewer than ten thousand. But neither of the great
religious parties was satisfied. 1. The Independents strongly objected to
the intolerance of the Presbyterian scheme;[1] and though willing that it
should be protected and countenanced by the state, they claimed a right
to form, according to the dictates of their consciences, separate
congregations for themselves. Their complaints were received with a willing
ear by the two houses, the members of which (so we are told by a Scottish
divine who attended the assembly at Westminster) might be divided into four
classes: the Presbyterians, who, in number and influence, surpassed any
one of the other three; the Independents, who, if few in number, were yet
distinguished by the superior talents and industry of their leaders; the
lawyers, who looked with jealousy on any attempt to erect an ecclesiastical
power independent of the legislature; and the men of irreligious habits,
who dreaded the stern and scrutinizing discipline of a Presbyterian kirk.
The two last occasionally

convenience, all the different sects enumerated at the time by Edwards
in his Gangraena,–Independents, Brownists, Millenaries, Antinomians,
Anabaptists, Arminians, Libertines, Familists, Enthusiasts, Seekers,
Perfectists, Socinians, Arianists, Anti-Trinitarians, Anti-Scripturists,
and Sceptics.–Neal’s Puritans, ii. 251. I observe that some of them
maintained that toleration was due even to Catholics. Baillie repeatedly
notices it with feelings of horror (ii. 17, 18, 43, 61).]
served to restore the balance between the two others, and by joining with
the Independents, to arrest the zeal, and neutralize the votes of
the Presbyterians.[a] With their aid, Cromwell, as the organ of the
discontented religionists, had obtained the appointment of a “grand
committee for accommodation,” which sat four months, and concluded nothing.
Its professed object was to reconcile the two parties, by inducing the
Presbyterians to recede from their lofty pretensions, and the Independents
to relax something of their sectarian obstinacy. Both were equally
inflexible. The former would admit of no innovation in the powers which
Christ, according to their creed, had bestowed on the presbytery; the
latter, rather than conform, expressed their readiness to suffer the
penalties of the law, or to seek some other clime, where the enjoyment of
civil, was combined with that of religious, freedom.[1]
2. The discontent of the Presbyterians arose from a very different
source. They complained that the parliament sacrilegiously usurped that
jurisdiction which Christ had vested exclusively in his church. The
assembly contended, that “the keys of the kingdom of heaven were committed
to the officers of the church, by virtue whereof, they have power
respectively to retain and remit sins, to shut the kingdom of heaven
against the impenitent by censures, and to open it to the penitent by
absolution.” These claims of the divines were zealously supported by their
brethren in parliament, and as fiercely opposed by all who were not of
their communion. The divines claimed for the presbyteries the right of
inquiring into the private lives of individuals, and of suspending the
unworthy[b]
[Footnote 1: Baillie, i. 408, 420, 431; ii. 11, 33, 37, 42, 57, 63, 66,

[Sidenote b: A.D. 1645. March 5.]
from the sacrament of the Lord’s supper; but the parliament refused the
first, and confined the second to cases of public scandal. They arrogated
to themselves the power of judging what offences should be deemed
scandalous; the parliament defined the particular offences, and appointed
civil commissioners in each province, to whom the presbyteries should refer
every case not previously enumerated. They allowed of no appeal from the
ecclesiastical tribunals to the civil magistrate; the parliament empowered
all who thought themselves aggrieved to apply for redress to either of
the two houses.[1] This profane mutilation of the divine right of the
presbyteries excited the alarm and execration of every orthodox believer.
When the ordinance for carrying the new plan into execution was in progress
through the Commons, the ministers generally determined not to act under
its provisions. The citizens of London, who petitioned against it, were
indeed silenced by a vote[a] that they had violated the privileges of the
house; but the Scottish commissioners came to their aid with a demand that
religion should be regulated to the satisfaction of the church; and the
assembly of divines ventured to remonstrate, that they could not
in conscience submit to an imperfect and anti-scriptural form of
ecclesiastical government. To the Scots a civil but unmeaning answer was
returned:[b] to alarm the assembly, it was resolved that the remonstrance
was a breach of privilege, and that nine questions should be proposed to
the divines, respecting the nature and object of the divine right to which
they pretended. These questions had been prepared by the ingenuity of
Selden and Whitelock,
[Footnote 1: Journals, vii. 469. Commons’, Sept. 25, Oct. 10, March 5.]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1646. March 26.]
[Sidenote b: A.D. 1646. April 22.]
ostensibly for the sake of information, in reality to breed dissension and
to procure delay.[1]
When the votes of the house were announced to the assembly, the members
anticipated nothing less than the infliction of those severe penalties with
which breaches of privilege were usually visited. They observed a day of
fasting and humiliation, to invoke the protection of God in favour of
his persecuted church; required the immediate attendance of their absent
colleagues; and then reluctantly entered on the consideration of the
questions sent to them from the Commons. In a few days, however, the king
took refuge in the Scottish army, and a new ray of hope cheered their
afflicted spirits. Additional petitions were presented; the answer of the
two houses became more accommodating; and the petitioners received thanks
for their zeal, with an assurance in conciliatory language that attention
should be paid to their requests. The immediate consequence was the
abolition of the provincial commissioners; and the ministers, softened
by this condescension, engaged to execute the ordinance in London and
Lancashire.[2] At the same time the assembly undertook the composition of a
catechism and confession of faith; but their progress was daily retarded by
the debates respecting the nine questions; and the influence of their party
was greatly diminished by the sudden death of the earl of Essex.[3][a]

ii. 194. “The pope and king,” he exclaims, “were never more earnest for the
headship of the church, than the plurality of this parliament” (196, 198,
199, 201, 216).]
[Footnote 2: These were the only places in which the Presbyterian
government was established according to law.]
[Footnote 3: Baillie says, “He was the head of our party here, kept
altogether who now are like, by that alone, to fall to pieces. The House of
Lords absolutely, the city very much, and many of the shires depended on
him” (ii. 234).]
[Sidenote a: A.D. 1644. .Sept. 14.]
It was, however, restored by the delivery of the king into the hands of the
parliament: petitions were immediately presented, complaining of the growth
of[a] error and schism; and the impatience of the citizens[b] induced them
to appoint a committee to wait daily at the door of the House of Commons,
till they should receive a favourable answer. But another revolution, to
be related in the next chapter, followed; the custody of the royal person
passed from the parliament to the army: and the hopes of the orthodox were
utterly extinguished.[1]
