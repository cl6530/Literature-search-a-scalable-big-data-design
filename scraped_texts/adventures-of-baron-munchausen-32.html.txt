  Ye bulls and crickets, and Gog, Magog,
  And trump’ts high chiming anthrophog,
  Come sing blithe choral all in og,
  Caralog, basilog, fog, and bog!
  Great and superb appears thy cap sublime,
    Admired and worshipp’d as the rising sun;
  Solemn, majestic, wise, like hoary Time,
    And fam’d alike for virtue, sense, and fun.
  Then swell the noble strain with song,
    And elegance divine,
  While goddesses around shall throng,
    And all the muses nine.
  And bulls, and crickets, and Gog, Magog,
  And trumpets chiming anthrophog,
  Shall sing blithe choral all in og,
  Caralog, basilog, fog, and bog!

in a reverie, thinking she was playing upon–– Was it a forte piano?
“No, my dear Fragrantia,” said I, tenderly taking her in my arms while
she melted into tears; “never, never, will I play upon any other––!”
