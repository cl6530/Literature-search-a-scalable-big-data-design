“Wake up there, youngster,” said a rough voice.
Ragged Dick opened his eyes slowly, and stared stupidly in the face
of the speaker, but did not offer to get up.
“Wake up, you young vagabond!” said the man a little impatiently;
“I suppose you’d lay there all day, if I hadn’t called you.”
“What time is it?” asked Dick.
“Seven o’clock.”
“Seven o’clock! I oughter’ve been up an hour ago. I know what ’twas
made me so precious sleepy. I went to the Old Bowery last night, and
didn’t turn in till past twelve.”
“You went to the Old Bowery? Where’d you get your money?” asked the
man, who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on
Spruce Street. “Made it by shines, in course. My guardian don’t
allow me no money for theatres, so I have to earn it.”
“Some boys get it easier than that,” said the porter significantly.
“You don’t catch me stealin’, if that’s what you mean,” said Dick.
“Don’t you ever steal, then?”
“No, and I wouldn’t. Lots of boys does it, but I wouldn’t.”
“Well, I’m glad to hear you say that. I believe there’s some
good in you, Dick, after all.”
“Oh, I’m a rough customer!” said Dick. “But I wouldn’t steal.
It’s mean.”
“I’m glad you think so, Dick,” and the rough voice sounded gentler
than at first. “Have you got any money to buy your breakfast?”
“No, but I’ll soon get some.”
While this conversation had been going on, Dick had got up. His
bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw, on which the
young boot-black had reposed his weary limbs, and slept as soundly
as if it had been a bed of down. He dumped down into the straw
without taking the trouble of undressing.
Getting up too was an equally short process. He jumped out of the
box, shook himself, picked out one or two straws that had found
their way into rents in his clothes, and, drawing a well-worn cap
over his uncombed locks, he was all ready for the business of the
day.
Dick’s appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar.
His pants were torn in several places, and had apparently belonged
in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself. He
wore a vest, all the buttons of which were gone except two, out of
which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month.
To complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him, dating
back, if one might judge from its general appearance, to a remote
antiquity.
Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in
commencing the day, but Dick was above such refinement. He had no
particular dislike to dirt, and did not think it necessary to remove
several dark streaks on his face and hands. But in spite of his dirt
and rags there was something about Dick that was attractive. It was
easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would
have been decidedly good-looking. Some of his companions were sly,
and their faces inspired distrust; but Dick had a frank,
straight-forward manner that made him a favorite.
Dick’s business hours had commenced. He had no office to open. His
little blacking-box was ready for use, and he looked sharply in
the faces of all who passed, addressing each with, “Shine yer
boots, sir?”
“How much?” asked a gentleman on his way to his office.
“Ten cents,” said Dick, dropping his box, and sinking upon his knees
on the sidewalk, flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled
in his profession.
“Ten cents! Isn’t that a little steep?”
“Well, you know ’taint all clear profit,” said Dick, who had already
set to work. “There’s the blacking costs something, and I have to
get a new brush pretty often.”
“And you have a large rent too,” said the gentleman quizzically,
with a glance at a large hole in Dick’s coat.
“Yes, sir,” said Dick, always ready to joke; “I have to pay such a
big rent for my manshun up on Fifth Avenoo, that I can’t afford to
take less than ten cents a shine. I’ll give you a bully shine, sir.”
“Be quick about it, for I am in a hurry. So your house is on Fifth
Avenue, is it?”
“It isn’t anywhere else,” said Dick, and Dick spoke the truth there.
“What tailor do you patronize?” asked the gentleman,
surveying Dick’s attire.
“Would you like to go to the same one?” asked Dick, shrewdly.
“Well, no; it strikes me that he didn’t give you a very good fit.”
“This coat once belonged to General Washington,” said Dick,
comically. “He wore it all through the Revolution, and it got torn
some, ’cause he fit so hard. When he died he told his widder to give
it to some smart young feller that hadn’t got none of his own; so
she gave it to me. But if you’d like it, sir, to remember General
Washington by, I’ll let you have it reasonable.”
“Thank you, but I wouldn’t want to deprive you of it. And did your
pants come from General Washington too?”
“No, they was a gift from Lewis Napoleon. Lewis had outgrown ’em
and sent ’em to me,–he’s bigger than me, and that’s why they
don’t fit.”
“It seems you have distinguished friends. Now, my lad, I suppose you
would like your money.”
“I shouldn’t have any objection,” said Dick.
“I believe,” said the gentleman, examining his pocket-book, “I
haven’t got anything short of twenty-five cents. Have you got
any change?”
“Not a cent,” said Dick. “All my money’s invested in the Erie
Railroad.”
“That’s unfortunate.”
“Shall I get the money changed, sir?”
“I can’t wait; I’ve got to meet an appointment immediately. I’ll
hand you twenty-five cents, and you can leave the change at my
office any time during the day.”
“All right, sir. Where is it?”
“No. 125 Fulton Street. Shall you remember?”
“Yes, sir. What name?”
“Greyson,–office on second floor.”
“All right, sir; I’ll bring it.”
“I wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest,” said Mr.
Greyson to himself, as he walked away. “If he does, I’ll give him
my custom regularly. If he don’t as is most likely, I shan’t mind
the loss of fifteen cents.”
Mr. Greyson didn’t understand Dick. Our ragged hero wasn’t a model
boy in all respects. I am afraid he swore sometimes, and now and
then he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country,
or gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the
city. A clergyman in search of the Cooper Institute he once directed
to the Tombs Prison, and, following him unobserved, was highly
delighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps
of the great stone building on Centre Street, and tried to obtain
admission.
“I guess he wouldn’t want to stay long if he did get in,” thought
Ragged Dick, hitching up his pants. “Leastways I shouldn’t. They’re
so precious glad to see you that they won’t let you go, but board
you gratooitous, and never send in no bills.”
Another of Dick’s faults was his extravagance. Being always
wide-awake and ready for business, he earned enough to have
supported him comfortably and respectably. There were not a few
young clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional
capacity, who scarcely earned as much as he, greatly as their style
and dress exceeded his. But Dick was careless of his earnings. Where
they went he could hardly have told himself. However much he managed
to earn during the day, all was generally spent before morning. He
was fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre, and to Tony Pastor’s,
and if he had any money left afterwards, he would invite some of
his friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew; so it seldom
happened that he commenced the day with a penny.
Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking.
This cost him considerable, for Dick was rather fastidious about his
cigars, and wouldn’t smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal
nature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of
course the expense was the smallest objection. No boy of fourteen
can smoke without being affected injuriously. Men are frequently
injured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the
newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet
they find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon
them. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out
of his mother’s sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction
of a veteran smoker.
There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was
a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which in the evening was
sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their
hard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves
from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a
glass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest.
I have mentioned Dick’s faults and defects, because I want it
understood, to begin with, that I don’t consider him a model boy.
But there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above
doing anything mean or dishonorable. He would not steal, or cheat,
or impose upon younger boys, but was frank and straight-forward,
manly and self-reliant. His nature was a noble one, and had saved
him from all mean faults. I hope my young readers will like him as
I do, without being blind to his faults. Perhaps, although he was
only a boot-black, they may find something in him to imitate.
And now, having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers,
I must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures.
