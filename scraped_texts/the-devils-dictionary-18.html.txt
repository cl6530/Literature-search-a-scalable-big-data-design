QUEEN, n.  A woman by whom the realm is ruled when there is a king, 
and through whom it is ruled when there is not.
QUILL, n.  An implement of torture yielded by a goose and commonly 
wielded by an ass.  This use of the quill is now obsolete, but its 
modern equivalent, the steel pen, is wielded by the same everlasting 
Presence.
QUIVER, n.  A portable sheath in which the ancient statesman and the 
aboriginal lawyer carried their lighter arguments.
  He extracted from his quiver,
      Did the controversial Roman,
  An argument well fitted
  To the question as submitted,
  Then addressed it to the liver,
      Of the unpersuaded foeman.
Oglum P. Boomp

QUIXOTIC, adj.  Absurdly chivalric, like Don Quixote.  An insight into 
the beauty and excellence of this incomparable adjective is unhappily 
denied to him who has the misfortune to know that the gentleman’s name 
is pronounced Ke-ho-tay.
  When ignorance from out of our lives can banish
  Philology, ’tis folly to know Spanish.
Juan Smith

QUORUM, n.  A sufficient number of members of a deliberative body to 
have their own way and their own way of having it.  In the United 
States Senate a quorum consists of the chairman of the Committee on 
Finance and a messenger from the White House; in the House of 
Representatives, of the Speaker and the devil.
QUOTATION, n.  The act of repeating erroneously the words of another.  
The words erroneously repeated.
  Intent on making his quotation truer,
  He sought the page infallible of Brewer,
  Then made a solemn vow that we would be
  Condemned eternally.  Ah, me, ah, me!
Stumpo Gaker

QUOTIENT, n.  A number showing how many times a sum of money belonging 
to one person is contained in the pocket of another — usually about 
as many times as it can be got there.
