In 1995, a father was frustrated that his daughters didn’t seem to like 
Hawthorne. No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least one did 
something about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer programmer living in New 
Hampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the Web. An electronic version, Eldred 
thought, with links to pictures and explanatory text, would make this 
nineteenth-century author’s work come alive.
It didn’t workat least for his daughters. They didn’t find Hawthorne any more 
interesting than before. But Eldred’s experiment gave birth to a hobby, and his 
hobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a library of public domain works by 
scanning these works and making them available for free.
Eldred’s library was not simply a copy of certain public domain works, though 
even a copy would have been of great value to people across the world who can’t 
get access to printed versions of these works. Instead, Eldred was producing 
derivative works from these public domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm 
into stories more accessible to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed 
Hawthorne, and many others, into a form more accessibletechnically accessible
today.
Eldred’s freedom to do this with Hawthorne’s work grew from the same source as 
Disney’s. Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter had passed into the public domain in 
1907. It was free for anyone to take without the permission of the Hawthorne 
estate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover Press and Penguin Classics, take 
works from the public domain and produce printed editions, which they sell in 
bookstores across the country. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and 
turn them into animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (/Cinderella), 
sometimes not (/The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet). These are all 
commercial publications of public domain works.
The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of public 
domain works. Eldred’s is just one example. There are literally thousands of 
others. Hundreds of thousands from across the world have discovered this 
platform of expression and now use it to share works that are, by law, free for 
the taking. This has produced what we might call the noncommercial publishing 
industry, which before the Internet was limited to people with large egos or 
with political or social causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range 
of individuals and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally. [1]
As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost’s collection of 
poems New Hampshire was slated to pass into the public domain. Eldred wanted 
to post that collection in his free public library. But Congress got in the way. 
As I described in chapter 10, in 1998, for the eleventh time in forty years, 
Congress extended the terms of existing copyrightsthis time by twenty years. 
Eldred would not be free to add any works more recent than 1923 to his 
collection until 2019. Indeed, no copyrighted work would pass into the public 
domain until that year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term again). 
By contrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents will pass into the 
public domain.
This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), enacted in memory 
of the congressman and former musician Sonny Bono, who, his widow, Mary Bono, 
says, believed that copy- rights should be forever. [2]
Eldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it through civil 
disobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he would publish 
as planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of a second law passed in 1998, 
the NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act of publishing would make Eldred a 
felonwhether or not anyone complained. This was a dangerous strategy for a 
disabled programmer to undertake.
It was here that I became involved in Eldred’s battle. I was a constitutional 
scholar whose first passion was constitutional interpretation. And though 
constitutional law courses never focus upon the Progress Clause of the 
Constitution, it had always struck me as importantly different. As you know, the 
Constitution says,
Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science ... by securing for 
limited Times to Authors ... exclusive Right to their ... Writings. ...
As I’ve described, this clause is unique within the power-granting clause of 
Article I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause granting power to 
Congress simply says Congress has the power to do somethingfor example, to 
regulate commerce among the several states” or declare War. But here, the 
something is something quite specificto promote ... Progressthrough means 
that are also specific by securing exclusive Rights (i.e., copyrights) for 
limited Times.
In the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of extending 
existing terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me about this was, if 
Congress has the power to extend existing terms, then the Constitution’s 
requirement that terms be limited will have no practical effect. If every time 
a copyright is about to expire, Congress has the power to extend its term, then 
Congress can achieve what the Constitution plainly forbidsperpetual terms on 
the installment plan, as Professor Peter Jaszi so nicely put it.
As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember sitting late 
at the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious consideration of the 
question. No one had ever challenged Congress’s practice of extending existing 
terms. That failure may in part be why Congress seemed so untroubled in its 
habit. That, and the fact that the practice had become so lucrative for 
Congress. Congress knows that copyright owners will be willing to pay a great 
deal of money to see their copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite 
happy to keep this gravy train going.
For this is the core of the corruption in our present system of 
government.Corruption not in the sense that representatives are bribed. 
Rather, corruption in the sense that the system induces the beneficiaries of 
Congress’s acts to raise and give money to Congress to induce it to act. There’s 
only so much time; there’s only so much Congress can do. Why not limit its 
actions to those things it must doand those things that pay? Extending 
copyright terms pays.
If that’s not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you’re one of the very 
few lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to make money one hundred 
years after it was created. The Estate of Robert Frost is a good example. Frost 
died in 1963. His poetry continues to be extraordinarily valuable. Thus the 
Robert Frost estate benefits greatly from any extension of copyright, since no 
publisher would pay the estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be 
published by anyone for free.
So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from three of 
Frost’s poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems is about to expire. You 
sit on the board of the Robert Frost estate. Your financial adviser comes to 
your board meeting with a very grim report:
Next year, the adviser announces, our copyrights in works A, B, and C will 
expire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be receiving the 
annual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of those works.
There’s a proposal in Congress, however, she continues, that could change 
this. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the terms of copyright by 
twenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily valuable to us. So we should 
hope this bill passes.
Hope? a fellow board member says. Can’t we be doing something about it?
Well, obviously, yes, the adviser responds. We could contribute to the 
campaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that they support the 
bill.
You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want to know 
whether this disgusting practice is worth it. How much would we get if this 
extension were passed? you ask the adviser. How much is it worth?
Well, the adviser says, if you’re confident that you will continue to get at 
least $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the ’discount rate’ 
that we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent), then this law would be 
worth $1,146,000 to the estate.
You’re a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the correct 
conclusion:
So you’re saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than $1,000,000 in 
campaign contributions if we were confident those contributions would assure 
that the bill was passed?
Absolutely, the adviser responds. It is worth it to you to contribute up to 
the ’present value’ of the income you expect from these copyrights. Which for us 
means over $1,000,000.
You quickly get the pointyou as the member of the board and, I trust, you the 
reader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every beneficiary in the 
position of the Robert Frost estate faces the same choice: If they can 
contribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights, they will benefit greatly 
from that extension. And so each time copyrights are about to expire, there is a 
massive amount of lobbying to get the copyright term extended.
Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legislation can be 
bought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in the world to buy 
further extensions of copyright.
In the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term 
Extension Act, this theory about incentives was proved real. Ten of the 
thirteen original sponsors of the act in the House received the maximum 
contribution from Disney’s political action committee; in the Senate, eight of 
the twelve sponsors received contributions. [3] The RIAA and the MPAA are 
estimated to have spent over $1.5 million lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. 
They paid out more than $200,000 in campaign contributions. [4] Disney is 
estimated to have contributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in the 
1998 cycle. [5]
Constitutional law is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at least, it need not be. 
So when I was considering Eldred’s complaint, this reality about the never-
ending incentives to increase the copyright term was central to my thinking. In 
my view, a pragmatic court committed to interpreting and applying the 
Constitution of our framers would see that if Congress has the power to extend 
existing terms, then there would be no effective constitutional requirement that 
terms be limited. If they could extend it once, they would extend it again and 
again and again.
It was also my judgment that this Supreme Court would not allow Congress to 
extend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme Court’s work knows, this 
Court has increasingly restricted the power of Congress when it has viewed 
Congress’s actions as exceeding the power granted to it by the Constitution. 
Among constitutional scholars, the most famous example of this trend was the 
Supreme Court’s decision in 1995 to strike down a law that banned the possession 
of guns near schools.
Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress’s granted powers very 
broadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate only 
commerce among the several states (aka interstate commerce”), the Supreme 
Court had interpreted that power to include the power to regulate any activity 
that merely affected interstate commerce.
As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there was no limit to 
Congress’s power to regulate, since just about every activity, when considered 
on a national scale, affects interstate commerce. A Constitution designed to 
limit Congress’s power was instead interpreted to impose no limit.
The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist’s command, changed that in 
/United States v. Lopez. The government had argued that possessing guns near 
schools affected interstate commerce. Guns near schools increase crime, crime 
lowers property values, and so on. In the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked 
the government whether there was any activity that would not affect interstate 
commerce under the reasoning the government advanced. The government said there 
was not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then that 
activity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the government said, 
was not in the position to second-guess Congress.
We pause to consider the implications of the government’s arguments, the Chief 
Justice wrote. [6] If anything Congress says is interstate commerce must 
therefore be considered interstate commerce, then there would be no limit to 
Congress’s power. The decision in Lopez was reaffirmed five years later in 
/United States v. Morrison. [7]
If a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the Progress Clause as 
much as the Commerce Clause. [8] And if it is applied to the Progress Clause, 
the principle should yield the conclusion that Congress can’t extend an existing 
term. If Congress could extend an existing term, then there would be no 
stopping point” to Congress’s power over terms, though the Constitution 
expressly states that there is such a limit. Thus, the same principle applied to 
the power to grant copyrights should entail that Congress is not allowed to 
extend the term of existing copyrights.
If, that is, the principle announced in Lopez stood for a principle. Many 
believed the decision in Lopez stood for politicsa conservative Supreme 
Court, which believed in states’ rights, using its power over Congress to 
advance its own personal political preferences. But I rejected that view of the 
Supreme Court’s decision. Indeed, shortly after the decision, I wrote an article 
demonstrating the fidelity in such an interpretation of the Constitution. The 
idea that the Supreme Court decides cases based upon its politics struck me as 
extraordinarily boring. I was not going to devote my life to teaching 
constitutional law if these nine Justices were going to be petty politicians. 
Now let’s pause for a moment to make sure we understand what the argument in 
/Eldred was not about. By insisting on the Constitution’s limits to copyright, 
obviously Eldred was not endorsing piracy. Indeed, in an obvious sense, he was 
fighting a kind of piracypiracy of the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote 
his work and when Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term 
was just fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney had 
already enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They had gotten the 
benefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions: In exchange for a 
monopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created new work. But now these 
entities were using their powerexpressed through the power of lobbyists’ money
to get another twenty-year dollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop would be 
taken from the public domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a piracy that affects us 
all.
Some people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief before the 
Supreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association wrote that the public 
domain is nothing more than legal piracy. [9] But it is not piracy when the 
law allows it; and in our constitutional system, our law requires it. Some may 
not like the Constitution’s requirements, but that doesn’t make the Constitution 
a pirate’s charter.
As we’ve seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copyright as a way 
to assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influence the development 
and distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric Eldred discovered, we have set up 
a system that assures that copyright terms will be repeatedly extended, and 
extended, and extended. We have created the perfect storm for the public domain. 
Copyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to 
be bought to extend them again.
It is valuable copyrights that are responsible for terms being extended. Mickey 
Mouse and Rhapsody in Blue. These works are too valuable for copyright owners 
to ignore. But the real harm to our society from copyright extensions is not 
that Mickey Mouse remains Disney’s. Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. 
Forget all the works from the 1920s and 1930s that have continuing commercial 
value. The real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The 
real harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially exploited, and 
no longer available as a result.
If you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to 1942) 
affected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 2 percent of that work 
has any continuing commercial value. It was the copyright holders for that 2 
percent who pushed the CTEA through. But the law and its effect were not limited 
to that 2 percent. The law extended the terms of copyright generally. [10]
Think practically about the consequence of this extensionpractically, as a 
businessperson, and not as a lawyer eager for more legal work. In 1930, 10,047 
books were published. In 2000, 174 of those books were still in print. Let’s say 
you were Brewster Kahle, and you wanted to make available to the world in your 
iArchive project the remaining 9,873. What would you have to do?
Well, first, you’d have to determine which of the 9,873 books were still under 
copyright. That requires going to a library (these data are not on-line) and 
paging through tomes of books, cross-checking the titles and authors of the 
9,873 books with the copyright registration and renewal records for works 
published in 1930. That will produce a list of books still under copyright.
Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate the current 
copyright owners. How would you do that?
Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright owners somewhere. 
Practical people think this way. How could there be thousands and thousands of 
government monopolies without there being at least a list?
But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in 1959, of the 
person who registered the copyright. But just think practically about how 
impossibly difficult it would be to track down thousands of such records
especially since the person who registered is not necessarily the current owner. 
And we’re just talking about 1930!
But there isn’t a list of who owns property generally, the apologists for the 
system respond. Why should there be a list of copyright owners?
Well, actually, if you think about it, there are plenty of lists of who owns 
what property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles to cars. And where there 
isn’t a list, the code of real space is pretty good at suggesting who the owner 
of a bit of property is. (A swing set in your backyard is probably yours.) So 
formally or informally, we have a pretty good way to know who owns what tangible 
property.
So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who owns the house by 
looking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see a car, there is ordinarily 
a license plate that will link the owner to the car. If you see a bunch of 
children’s toys sitting on the front lawn of a house, it’s fairly easy to 
determine who owns the toys. And if you happen to see a baseball lying in a 
gutter on the side of the road, look around for a second for some kids playing 
ball. If you don’t see any kids, then okay: Here’s a bit of property whose owner 
we can’t easily determine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we 
ordinarily know quite well who owns what property.
Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library. The library 
owns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I’ve already described, there’s 
no list of copyright owners. There are authors’ names, of course, but their 
copyrights could have been assigned, or passed down in an estate like Grandma’s 
old jewelry. To know who owns what, you would have to hire a private detective. 
The bottom line: The owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, 
in which it is a felony to use such property without the property owner’s 
permission, the property isn’t going to be used.
The consequence with respect to old books is that they won’t be digitized, and 
hence will simply rot away on shelves. But the consequence for other creative 
works is much more dire.
Consider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Studios, which owns 
the copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee is a direct beneficiary of 
the Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films were made between 1921 and 1951. Only 
one of these films, The Lucky Dog, is currently out of copyright. But for the 
CTEA, films made after 1923 would have begun entering the public domain. Because 
Agee controls the exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great 
deal of money. According to one estimate, Roach has sold about 60,000 
videocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo’s silent films. [11]
Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare virtue in this 
culture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the Supreme Court that the 
Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act will, if left standing, destroy a whole 
generation of American film.
His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has any continuing 
commercial value. The restto the extent it survives at allsits in vaults 
gathering dust. It may be that some of this work not now commercially valuable 
will be deemed to be valuable by the owners of the vaults. For this to occur, 
however, the commercial benefit from the work must exceed the costs of making 
the work available for distribution.
We can’t know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs. For most of 
the history of film, the costs of restoring film were very high; digital 
technology has lowered these costs substantially. While it cost more than 
$10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white film in 1993, it can now cost 
as little as $100 to digitize one hour of 8 mm film. [12]
Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most important. Lawyers, 
too, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In addition to 
preserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights. And to secure the 
rights for a film that is under copyright, you need to locate the copyright 
owner.
Or more accurately, owners. As we’ve seen, there isn’t only a single copyright 
associated with a film; there are many. There isn’t a single person whom you can 
contact about those copyrights; there are as many as can hold the rights, which 
turns out to be an extremely large number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights 
to these films is exceptionally high.
But can’t you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the copyright 
owner when she shows up? Sure, if you want to commit a felony. And even if 
you’re not worried about committing a felony, when she does show up, she’ll have 
the right to sue you for all the profits you have made. So, if you’re 
successful, you can be fairly confident you’ll be getting a call from someone’s 
lawyer. And if you’re not successful, you won’t make enough to cover the costs 
of your own lawyer. Either way, you have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too 
often the case, saying you have to talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you 
won’t make any money.
For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed these costs. 
But for the vast majority of them, there is no way the benefit would outweigh 
the legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old films, Agee argued, the film 
will not be restored and distributed until the copyright expires.
But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will have 
expired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and nitrate stock 
dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal canisters in which they 
are now stored will be filled with nothing more than dust.
Of all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has 
continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a 
crucially important legal device. For that tiny fraction, the copyright creates 
incentives to produce and distribute the creative work. For that tiny fraction, 
the copyright acts as an engine of free expression.
But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the creative work 
has a commercial life is extremely short. As I’ve indicated, most books go out 
of print within one year. The same is true of music and film. Commercial culture 
is sharklike. It must keep moving. And when a creative work falls out of favor 
with the commercial distributors, the commercial life ends.
Yet that doesn’t mean the life of the creative work ends. We don’t keep 
libraries of books in order to compete with Barnes & Noble, and we don’t have 
archives of films because we expect people to choose between spending Friday 
night watching new movies and spending Friday night watching a 1930 news 
documentary. The noncommercial life of culture is important and valuablefor 
entertainment but also, and more importantly, for knowledge. To understand who 
we are, and where we came from, and how we have made the mistakes that we have, 
we need to have access to this history.
Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression. In this 
context, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in this context do 
no good.
Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of our 
history, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no copyright-related 
use that would be inhibited by an exclusive right. When a book went out of 
print, you could not buy it from a publisher. But you could still buy it from a 
used book store, and when a used book store sells it, in America, at least, 
there is no need to pay the copyright owner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of 
a book after its commercial life ended was a use that was independent of 
copyright law.
The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring a filmthe 
real economic costs, not the lawyer costswere so high, it was never at all 
feasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains of a great dinner, when 
it’s over, it’s over. Once a film passed out of its commercial life, it may have 
been archived for a bit, but that was the end of its life so long as the market 
didn’t have more to offer.
In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most of our 
history, long copyrights wouldn’t have mattered for the works that lost their 
commercial value. Long copyrights for these works would not have interfered with 
anything.
But this situation has now changed.
One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital technologies is 
to enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of. Digital technologies now 
make it possible to preserve and give access to all sorts of knowledge. Once a 
book goes out of print, we can now imagine digitizing it and making it available 
to everyone, forever. Once a film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it 
and make it available to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give new life 
to copyrighted material after it passes out of its commercial life. It is now 
possible to preserve and assure universal access to this knowledge and culture, 
whereas before it was not.
And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of producing this digital 
archive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of copyright. To 
digitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires permission of the copyright 
owner. The same with music, film, or any other aspect of our culture protected 
by copyright. The effort to make these things available to history, or to 
researchers, or to those who just want to explore, is now inhibited by a set of 
rules that were written for a radically different context.
Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: Now that 
technology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, the law gets in the 
way. And it doesn’t get in the way for any useful copyright purpose, for the 
purpose of copyright is to enable the commercial market that spreads culture. 
No, we are talking about culture after it has lived its commercial life. In this 
context, copyright is serving no purpose at all related to the spread of 
knowledge. In this context, copyright is not an engine of free expression. 
Copyright is a brake.
You may well ask, But if digital technologies lower the costs for Brewster 
Kahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too. So won’t Random 
House do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading culture widely?
Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that publishers 
would be as complete as libraries. If Barnes & Noble offered to lend books from 
its stores for a low price, would that eliminate the need for libraries? Only if 
you think that the only role of a library is to serve what the market would 
demand. But if you think the role of a library is bigger than thisif you think 
its role is to archive culture, whether there’s a demand for any particular bit 
of that culture or notthen we can’t count on the commercial market to do our 
library work for us.
I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We should 
rely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable culture. My 
message is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the market is not doing 
the job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the freedom to fill the gaps. As 
one researcher calculated for American culture, 94 percent of the films, books, 
and music produced between 1923 and 1946 is not commercially available. However 
much you love the commercial market, if access is a value, then 6 percent is a 
failure to provide that value. [13]
In January 1999, we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred’s behalf in federal district 
court in Washington, D.C., asking the court to declare the Sonny Bono Copyright 
Term Extension Act unconstitutional. The two central claims that we made were 
(1) that extending existing terms violated the Constitution’s limited Times 
requirement, and (2) that extending terms by another twenty years violated the 
First Amendment.
The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an argument. A 
panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also dismissed our claims, 
though after hearing an extensive argument. But that decision at least had a 
dissent, by one of the most conservative judges on that court. That dissent gave 
our claims life.
Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that copyrights be 
for limited Times only. His argument was as elegant as it was simple: If 
Congress can extend existing terms, then there is no stopping point to 
Congress’s power under the Copyright Clause. The power to extend existing terms 
means Congress is not required to grant terms that are limited. Thus, Judge 
Sentelle argued, the court had to interpret the term limited Times to give it 
meaning. And the best interpretation, Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny 
Congress the power to extend existing terms.
We asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to hear the case. 
Cases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for important cases or 
cases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a whole, where the court will 
sit en banc to hear the case.
The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc. This time, 
Judge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the D.C. Circuit, Judge 
David Tatel. Both the most conservative and the most liberal judges in the D.C. 
Circuit believed Congress had over-stepped its bounds.
It was here that most expected Eldred v. Ashcroft would die, for the Supreme 
Court rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It hears about one 
hundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand appeals.) And it 
practically never reviews a decision that upholds a statute when no other court 
has yet reviewed the statute.
But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by granting our 
petition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument was set for October of 
2002. The summer would be spent writing briefs and preparing for argument.
It is over a year later as I write these words. It is still astonishingly hard. 
If you know anything at all about this story, you know that we lost the appeal. 
And if you know something more than just the minimum, you probably think there 
was no way this case could have been won. After our defeat, I received literally 
thousands of missives by well-wishers and supporters, thanking me for my work on 
behalf of this noble but doomed cause. And none from this pile was more 
significant to me than the e-mail from my client, Eric Eldred.
But my client and these friends were wrong. This case could have been won. It 
should have been won. And no matter how hard I try to retell this story to 
myself, I can never escape believing that my own mistake lost it.
The mistake was made early, though it became obvious only at the very end. Our 
case had been supported from the very beginning by an extraordinary lawyer, 
Geoffrey Stewart, and by the law firm he had moved to, Jones, Day, Reavis and 
Pogue. Jones Day took a great deal of heat from its copyright-protectionist 
clients for supporting us. They ignored this pressure (something that few law 
firms today would ever do), and throughout the case, they gave it everything 
they could.
There were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff Stewart was the 
first, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became quite involved. Bromberg and 
Ayer in particular had a common view about how this case would be won: We would 
only win, they repeatedly told me, if we could make the issue seem important 
to the Supreme Court. It had to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free 
speech and free culture; otherwise, they would never vote against the most 
powerful media companies in the world.
I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act was a 
dramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still think it is. 
But the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based on how important they 
believe the issues are is just wrong. It might be right as in true, I 
thought, but it is wrong as in it just shouldn’t be that way. As I believed 
that any faithful interpretation of what the framers of our Constitution did 
would yield the conclusion that the CTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed 
that any faithful interpretation of what the First Amendment means would yield 
the conclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is 
unconstitutional, I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like soap. 
Just as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not because the Court 
likes Nazis but because such a law would violate the Constitution, so too, in my 
view, would the Court decide whether Congress’s law was constitutional based on 
the Constitution, not based on whether they liked the values that the framers 
put in the Constitution.
In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and the harm 
caused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review? There was no 
reason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they weren’t convinced that this 
regulation was harmful. So in my view, we didn’t need to persuade them that this 
law was bad, we needed to show why it was unconstitutional.
There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter and in which I 
thought a response was appropriate. I was convinced that the Court would not 
hear our arguments if it thought these were just the arguments of a group of 
lefty loons. This Supreme Court was not about to launch into a new field of 
judicial review if it seemed that this field of review was simply the preference 
of a small political minority. Although my focus in the case was not to 
demonstrate how bad the Sonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it was 
unconstitutional, my hope was to make this argument against a background of 
briefs that covered the full range of political views. To show that this claim 
against the CTEA was grounded in law and not politics, then, we tried to 
gather the widest range of credible criticscredible not because they were rich 
and famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated that this law was 
unconstitutional regardless of one’s politics.
The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly’s organization, Eagle 
Forum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the very beginning. Mrs. Schlafly 
viewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress. In November 1998, she wrote a stinging 
editorial attacking the Republican Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she 
wrote, Do you sometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to 
narrow special interests slide easily through the intricate legislative process, 
while bills that benefit the general public seem to get bogged down? The 
answer, as the editorial documented, was the power of money. Schlafly enumerated 
Disney’s contributions to the key players on the committees. It was money, not 
justice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty more years in Disney’s control, Schlafly 
argued.
In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief supporting our 
position. Their brief made the argument that became the core claim in the 
Supreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of existing copyrights, there is 
no limit to Congress’s power to set terms. That strong conservative argument 
persuaded a strong conservative judge, Judge Sentelle.
In the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse as it gets. 
They included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free Software Foundation 
(home of the GNU project that made GNU Linux possible). They included a 
powerful brief about the costs of uncertainty by Intel. There were two law 
professors’ briefs, one by copyright scholars and one by First Amendment 
scholars. There was an exhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the world’s 
experts in the history of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new 
brief by Eagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments.
Those briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal argument, there 
were a number of powerful briefs by libraries and archives, including the 
Internet Archive, the American Association of Law Libraries, and the National 
Writers Union.
But two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the argument I’ve 
already described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued that unless the law was 
struck, a whole generation of American film would disappear. The other made the 
economic argument absolutely clear.
This economists’ brief was signed by seventeen economists, including five Nobel 
Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan, Milton Friedman, Kenneth 
Arrow, and George Akerlof. The economists, as the list of Nobel winners 
demonstrates, spanned the political spectrum. Their conclusions were powerful: 
There was no plausible claim that extending the terms of existing copyrights 
would do anything to increase incentives to create. Such extensions were nothing 
more than rent-seekingthe fancy term economists use to describe special-
interest legislation gone wild.
The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gathered to write 
our briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been with us from the start. 
But when the case got to the Supreme Court, we added three lawyers to help us 
frame this argument to this Court: Alan Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, 
a Washington group that had made constitutional history with a series of seminal 
victories in the Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and 
dean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and who had 
advised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and finally, former 
solicitor general Charles Fried.
Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor general 
was hired by the other side to defend Congress’s power to give media companies 
the special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried was the only one who turned 
down that lucrative assignment to stand up for something he believed in. He had 
been Ronald Reagan’s chief lawyer in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the 
line of cases that limited Congress’s power in the context of the Commerce 
Clause. And while he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court that I 
personally disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of confidence in our 
argument.
The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of friends, as 
well. Significantly, however, none of these friends” included historians or 
economists. The briefs on the other side of the case were written exclusively by 
major media companies, congressmen, and copyright holders.
The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to gain from the law. 
The congressmen were not surprising eitherthey were defending their power and, 
indirectly, the gravy train of contributions such power induced. And of course 
it was not surprising that the copyright holders would defend the idea that they 
should continue to have the right to control who did what with content they 
wanted to control.
Dr.Seuss’s representatives, for example, argued that it was better for the Dr. 
Seuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss’s workbetter than allowing 
it to fall into the public domainbecause if this creativity were in the public 
domain, then people could use it to glorify drugs or to create pornography. 
[14] That was also the motive of the Gershwin estate, which defended its 
protection of the work of George Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to 
license Porgy and Bess to anyone who refuses to use African Americans in the 
cast. [15] That’s their view of how this part of American culture should be 
controlled, and they wanted this law to help them effect that control.
This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this debate. When 
Congress decides to extend the term of existing copyrights, Congress is making a 
choice about which speakers it will favor. Famous and beloved copyright owners, 
such as the Gershwin estate and Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, Give us 
twenty years to control the speech about these icons of American culture. We’ll 
do better with them than anyone else. Congress of course likes to reward the 
popular and famous by giving them what they want. But when Congress gives people 
an exclusive right to speak in a certain way, that’s just what the First 
Amendment is traditionally meant to block.
We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the CTEA mean that 
there was no limit to the power of Congress to extend copyrightsextensions that 
would further concentrate the market; it would also mean that there was no limit 
to Congress’s power to play favorites, through copyright, with who has the right 
to speak.
Between February and October, there was little I did beyond preparing for this 
case. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy.
The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One camp we called the 
Conservatives. The other we called the Rest. The Conservatives included Chief 
Justice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and 
Justice Thomas. These five had been the most consistent in limiting Congress’s 
power. They were the five who had supported the Lopez/Morrison line of cases 
that said that an enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that 
Congress’s powers had limits.
The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on Congress’s 
power. These fourJustice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice 
Breyerhad repeatedly argued that the Constitution gives Congress broad 
discretion to decide how best to implement its powers. In case after case, these 
justices had argued that the Court’s role should be one of deference. Though the 
votes of these four justices were the votes that I personally had most 
consistently agreed with, they were also the votes that we were least likely to 
get.
In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg’s. In addition to her 
general view about deference to Congress (except where issues of gender are 
involved), she had been particularly deferential in the context of intellectual 
property protections. She and her daughter (an excellent and well-known 
intellectual property scholar) were cut from the same intellectual property 
cloth. We expected she would agree with the writings of her daughter: that 
Congress had the power in this context to do as it wished, even if what Congress 
wished made little sense.
Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also viewed as unlikely 
allies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter strongly favored deference to 
Congress, as did Justice Breyer. But both were also very sensitive to free 
speech concerns. And as we strongly believed, there was a very important free 
speech argument against these retrospective extensions.
The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice Stevens. History 
will record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest judges on this Court. His 
votes are consistently eclectic, which just means that no simple ideology 
explains where he will stand. But he had consistently argued for limits in the 
context of intellectual property generally. We were fairly confident he would 
recognize limits here.
This analysis of the Rest showed most clearly where our focus had to be: on 
the Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open these five and get at 
least a majority to go our way.Thus, the single overriding argument that 
animated our claim rested on the Conservatives’ most important jurisprudential 
innovationthe argument that Judge Sentelle had relied upon in the Court of 
Appeals, that Congress’s power must be interpreted so that its enumerated powers 
have limits.
This then was the core of our strategya strategy for which I am responsible. We 
would get the Court to see that just as with the Lopez case, under the 
government’s argument here, Congress would always have unlimited power to extend 
existing terms. If anything was plain about Congress’s power under the Progress 
Clause, it was that this power was supposed to be limited. Our aim would be to 
get the Court to reconcile Eldred with Lopez: If Congress’s power to 
regulate commerce was limited, then so, too, must Congress’s power to regulate 
copyright be limited.
The argument on the government’s side came down to this: Congress has done it 
before. It should be allowed to do it again. The government claimed that from 
the very beginning, Congress has been extending the term of existing copyrights. 
So, the government argued, the Court should not now say that practice is 
unconstitutional.
There was some truth to the government’s claim, but not much. We certainly 
agreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831 and in 1909. And of 
course, in 1962, Congress began extending existing terms regularlyeleven times 
in forty years.
But this consistency should be kept in perspective. Congress extended existing 
terms once in the first hundred years of the Republic. It then extended existing 
terms once again in the next fifty. Those rare extensions are in contrast to the 
now regular practice of extending existing terms. Whatever restraint Congress 
had had in the past, that restraint was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of 
extensions; there was no reason to expect that cycle would end. This Court had 
not hesitated to intervene where Congress was in a similar cycle of extension. 
There was no reason it couldn’t intervene here.
Oral argument was scheduled for the first week in October. I arrived in D.C. two 
weeks before the argument. During those two weeks, I was repeatedly mooted by 
lawyers who had volunteered to help in the case. Such moots are basically 
practice rounds, where wannabe justices fire questions at wannabe winners.
I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a single point: 
that if this extension is permitted, then there is no limit to the power to set 
terms. Going with the government would mean that terms would be effectively 
unlimited; going with us would give Congress a clear line to follow: Don’t 
extend existing terms. The moots were an effective practice; I found ways to 
take every question back to this central idea.
One moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the skeptic. He had 
served in the Reagan Justice Department with Solicitor General Charles Fried. He 
had argued many cases before the Supreme Court. And in his review of the moot, 
he let his concern speak:
I’m just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won’t be willing to 
upset this practice that the government says has been a consistent practice for 
two hundred years. You have to make them see the harmpassionately get them to 
see the harm. For if they don’t see that, then we haven’t any chance of 
winning.
He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but he didn’t 
understand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the right thingnot 
because of politics but because it was right. As a law professor, I had spent my 
life teaching my students that this Court does the right thingnot because of 
politics but because it is right. As I listened to Ayer’s plea for passion in 
pressing politics, I understood his point, and I rejected it. Our argument was 
right. That was enough. Let the politicians learn to see that it was also good.
The night before the argument, a line of people began to form in front of the 
Supreme Court. The case had become a focus of the press and of the movement to 
free culture. Hundreds stood in line for the chance to see the proceedings. 
Scores spent the night on the Supreme Court steps so that they would be assured 
a seat.
Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can ask for seats 
they control. (I asked Justice Scalia’s chambers for seats for my parents, for 
example.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get a seat in a special section 
reserved for them. And senators and congressmen have a special place where they 
get to sit, too. And finally, of course, the press has a gallery, as do clerks 
working for the Justices on the Court. As we entered that morning, there was no 
place that was not taken. This was an argument about intellectual property law, 
yet the halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat at the front of the 
Court, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table, I saw 
Jack Valenti sitting in the special section ordinarily reserved for family of 
the Justices.
When the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began where I intended 
to stay: on the question of the limits on Congress’s power. This was a case 
about enumerated powers, I said, and whether those enumerated powers had any 
limit.
Justice O’Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening. The history was 
bothering her.
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Congress has extended the term so often through the years, 
and if you are right, don’t we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of 
time? I mean, this seems to be a practice that began with the very first act.
She was quite willing to concede that this flies directly in the face of what 
the framers had in mind. But my response again and again was to emphasize 
limits on Congress’s power.
MR. LESSIG: Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in mind, then 
the question is, is there a way of interpreting their words that gives effect to 
what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.
There were two points in this argument when I should have seen where the Court 
was going. The first was a question by Justice Kennedy, who observed,
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that the 76 act, 
too, should have been declared void, and that we might leave it alone because of 
the disruption, is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in 
science and the useful arts. I just don’t see any empirical evidence for that.
Here follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a student, I 
answered,
MR. LESSIG: Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. Nothing in 
our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding 
progress. Our only argument is this is a structural limit necessary to assure 
that what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the 
copyright laws.
That was a correct answer, but it wasn’t the right answer. The right answer was 
instead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any number of briefs had 
been written about it. He wanted to hear it. And here was the place Don Ayer’s 
advice should have mattered. This was a softball; my answer was a swing and a 
miss.
The second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had been crafted. For 
the Chief Justice had crafted the Lopez ruling, and we hoped that he would see 
this case as its second cousin.
It was clear a second into his question that he wasn’t at all sympathetic. To 
him, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked:
CHIEF JUSTICE: Well, but you want more than that. You want the right to copy 
verbatim other people’s books, don’t you?
MR. LESSIG: We want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the 
public domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be 
justified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under a proper reading of 
the limits built into the Copyright Clause.
Things went better for us when the government gave its argument; for now the 
Court picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia asked Solicitor 
General Olson,
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that the functional equivalent of an unlimited time 
would be a violation [of the Constitution], but that’s precisely the argument 
that’s being made by petitioners here, that a limited time which is extendable 
is the functional equivalent of an unlimited time.
When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal. Olson’s 
flailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed to the academic, 
not the practical. The government was arguing as if this were the first case 
ever to consider limits on Congress’s Copyright and Patent Clause power. Ever 
the professor and not the advocate, I closed by pointing out the long history of 
the Court imposing limits on Congress’s power in the name of the Copyright and 
Patent Clauseindeed, the very first case striking a law of Congress as 
exceeding a specific enumerated power was based upon the Copyright and Patent 
Clause. All true. But it wasn’t going to move the Court to my side.
As I left the court that day, I knew there were a hundred points I wished I 
could remake. There were a hundred questions I wished I had answered 
differently. But one way of thinking about this case left me optimistic.
The government had been asked over and over again, what is the limit? Over and 
over again, it had answered there is no limit. This was precisely the answer I 
wanted the Court to hear. For I could not imagine how the Court could understand 
that the government believed Congress’s power was unlimited under the terms of 
the Copyright Clause, and sustain the government’s argument. The solicitor 
general had made my argument for me. No matter how often I tried, I could not 
understand how the Court could find that Congress’s power under the Commerce 
Clause was limited, but under the Copyright Clause, unlimited. In those rare 
moments when I let myself believe that we may have prevailed, it was because I 
felt this Courtin particular, the Conservativeswould feel itself constrained 
by the rule of law that it had established elsewhere.
The morning of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to the office and 
missed the 7:00 A.M.call from the Supreme Court clerk. Listening to the message, 
I could tell in an instant that she had bad news to report.The Supreme Court had 
affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Seven justices had voted in the 
majority. There were two dissents.
A few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the phone off the 
hook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat down to see where I had been 
wrong in my reasoning.
My reasoning. Here was a case that pitted all the money in the world against 
/reasoning. And here was the last naïve law professor, scouring the pages, 
looking for reasoning.
I first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would distinguish the 
principle in this case from the principle in Lopez. The argument was nowhere 
to be found. The case was not even cited. The argument that was the core 
argument of our case did not even appear in the Court’s opinion.
Justice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument. Consistent with 
her view that Congress’s power was not limited generally, she had found 
Congress’s power not limited here.
Her opinion was perfectly reasonablefor her, and for Justice Souter. Neither 
believes in Lopez. It would be too much to expect them to write an opinion 
that recognized, much less explained, the doctrine they had worked so hard to 
defeat.
But as I realized what had happened, I couldn’t quite believe what I was 
reading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile limited powers 
with the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with the Progress Clause. It had 
never even occurred to me that they could reconcile the two simply by not 
addressing the argument. There was no inconsistency because they would not talk 
about the two together. There was therefore no principle that followed from the 
Lopez case: In that context, Congress’s power would be limited, but in this 
context it would not.
Yet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers’ values they would 
respect? By what right did theythe silent fiveget to select the part of the 
Constitution they would enforce based on the values they thought important? We 
were right back to the argument that I said I hated at the start: I had failed 
to convince them that the issue here was important, and I had failed to 
recognize that however much I might hate a system in which the Court gets to 
pick the constitutional values that it will respect, that is the system we have.
Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens’s opinion was 
crafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition of intellectual 
property law should not support this unjustified extension of terms. He based 
his argument on a parallel analysis that had governed in the context of patents 
(so had we). But the rest of the Court discounted the parallelwithout 
explaining how the very same words in the Progress Clause could come to mean 
totally different things depending upon whether the words were about patents or 
copyrights. The Court let Justice Stevens’s charge go unanswered.
Justice Breyer’s opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever written, was 
external to the Constitution. He argued that the term of copyrights has become 
so long as to be effectively unlimited. We had said that under the current term, 
a copyright gave an author 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term. Breyer 
said we were wrong, that the actual number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual 
term. Either way, the point was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be 
limited, and the existing term was so long as to be effectively unlimited, 
then it was unconstitutional.
These two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But because neither 
believed in the Lopez case, neither was willing to push it as a reason to 
reject this extension. The case was decided without anyone having addressed the 
argument that we had carried from Judge Sentelle. It was Hamlet without the 
Prince.
Defeat brings depression. They say it is a sign of health when depression gives 
way to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn’t cure the depression. This 
anger was of two sorts.
It was first anger with the five Conservatives. It would have been one thing 
for them to have explained why the principle of Lopez didn’t apply in this 
case. That wouldn’t have been a very convincing argument, I don’t believe, 
having read it made by others, and having tried to make it myself. But it at 
least would have been an act of integrity. These justices in particular have 
repeatedly said that the proper mode of interpreting the Constitution is 
originalismto first understand the framers’ text, interpreted in their 
context, in light of the structure of the Constitution. That method had produced 
Lopez and many other originalist rulings. Where was their originalism” now?
Here, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain what the 
framers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they did; they joined an 
opinion that never once tried to explain how the structure of that clause would 
affect the interpretation of Congress’s power. And they joined an opinion that 
didn’t even try to explain why this grant of power could be unlimited, whereas 
the Commerce Clause would be limited. In short, they had joined an opinion that 
did not apply to, and was inconsistent with, their own method for interpreting 
the Constitution. This opinion may well have yielded a result that they liked. 
It did not produce a reason that was consistent with their own principles.
My anger with the Conservatives quickly yielded to anger with myself. For I had 
let a view of the law that I liked interfere with a view of the law as it is.
Most lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for idealism about 
courts in general and this Supreme Court in particular. Most have a much more 
pragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that this case would be won based on whether 
I could convince the Justices that the framers’ values were important, I fought 
the idea, because I didn’t want to believe that that is how this Court decides. 
I insisted on arguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of 
principles. I had an argument that followed in logic. I didn’t need to waste my 
time showing it should also follow in popularity.
As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I can see a 
hundred places where the answers could have taken the conversation in different 
directions, where the truth about the harm that this unchecked power will cause 
could have been made clear to this Court. Justice Kennedy in good faith wanted 
to be shown. I, idiotically, corrected his question. Justice Souter in good 
faith wanted to be shown the First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher, 
reframed the question to make the logical point. I had shown them how they could 
strike this law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a hundred places where 
I could have helped them want to, yet my stubbornness, my refusal to give in, 
stopped me. I have stood before hundreds of audiences trying to persuade; I have 
used passion in that effort to persuade; but I refused to stand before this 
audience and try to persuade with the passion I had used elsewhere. It was not 
the basis on which a court should decide the issue.
Would it have been different if I had argued it differently? Would it have been 
different if Don Ayer had argued it? Or Charles Fried? Or Kathleen Sullivan?
My friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court was not ready, my 
friends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It would take a great deal 
more to show our society why our framers were right. And when we do that, we 
will be able to show that Court.
Maybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in doing 
anything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have little reason 
to resist doing right. I can’t help but think that if I had stepped down from 
this pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I could have persuaded.
And even if I couldn’t, then that doesn’t excuse what happened in January. For 
at the start of this case, one of America’s leading intellectual property 
professors stated publicly that my bringing this case was a mistake. The Court 
is not ready, Peter Jaszi said; this issue should not be raised until it is.
After the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and publicly, that 
he was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have been persuaded, then that 
is all the evidence that’s needed to know that here again Peter was right. 
Either I was not ready to argue this case in a way that would do some good or 
they were not ready to hear this case in a way that would do some good. Either 
way, the decision to bring this casea decision I had made four years beforewas 
wrong.
While the reaction to the Sonny Bono Act itself was almost unanimously negative, 
the reaction to the Court’s decision was mixed. No one, at least in the press, 
tried to say that extending the term of copyright was a good idea. We had won 
that battle over ideas. Where the decision was praised, it was praised by papers 
that had been skeptical of the Court’s activism in other cases. Deference was a 
good thing, even if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was 
attacked, it was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful law. The 
New York Times wrote in its editorial,
In effect, the Supreme Court’s decision makes it likely that we are seeing the 
beginning of the end of public domain and the birth of copyright perpetuity. The 
public domain has been a grand experiment, one that should not be allowed to 
die. The ability to draw freely on the entire creative output of humanity is one 
of the reasons we live in a time of such fruitful creative ferment.
The best responses were in the cartoons. There was a gaggle of hilarious images
of Mickey in jail and the like. The best, from my view of the case, was Ruben 
Bolling’s, reproduced on the next page. The powerful and wealthy line is a bit 
unfair. But the punch in the face felt exactly like that.
The image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the quote from 
/The New York Times. That grand experiment we call the public domain is 
over? When I can make light of it, I think, Honey, I shrunk the Constitution. 
But I can rarely make light of it. We had in our Constitution a commitment to 
free culture. In the case that I fathered, the Supreme Court effectively 
renounced that commitment. A better lawyer would have made them see differently.
