EAT, v.i.  To perform successively (and successfully) the functions of 
mastication, humectation, and deglutition.
  “I was in the drawing-room, enjoying my dinner,” said Brillat- 
Savarin, beginning an anecdote.  “What!” interrupted Rochebriant; 
“eating dinner in a drawing-room?”  “I must beg you to observe, 
monsieur,” explained the great gastronome, “that I did not say I was 
eating my dinner, but enjoying it.  I had dined an hour before.”
EAVESDROP, v.i.  Secretly to overhear a catalogue of the crimes and 
vices of another or yourself.
  A lady with one of her ears applied
  To an open keyhole heard, inside,
  Two female gossips in converse free —
  The subject engaging them was she.
  “I think,” said one, “and my husband thinks
  That she’s a prying, inquisitive minx!"
  As soon as no more of it she could hear
  The lady, indignant, removed her ear.
  “I will not stay,” she said, with a pout,
  “To hear my character lied about!”
Gopete Sherany

ECCENTRICITY, n.  A method of distinction so cheap that fools employ 
it to accentuate their incapacity.
ECONOMY, n.  Purchasing the barrel of whiskey that you do not need for 
the price of the cow that you cannot afford.
EDIBLE, adj.  Good to eat, and wholesome to digest, as a worm to a 
toad, a toad to a snake, a snake to a pig, a pig to a man, and a man 
to a worm.
EDITOR, n.  A person who combines the judicial functions of Minos, 
Rhadamanthus and Aeacus, but is placable with an obolus; a severely 
virtuous censor, but so charitable withal that he tolerates the 
virtues of others and the vices of himself; who flings about him the 
splintering lightning and sturdy thunders of admonition till he 
resembles a bunch of firecrackers petulantly uttering his mind at the 
tail of a dog; then straightway murmurs a mild, melodious lay, soft as 
the cooing of a donkey intoning its prayer to the evening star.  
Master of mysteries and lord of law, high-pinnacled upon the throne of 
thought, his face suffused with the dim splendors of the 
Transfiguration, his legs intertwisted and his tongue a-cheek, the 
editor spills his will along the paper and cuts it off in lengths to 
suit.  And at intervals from behind the veil of the temple is heard 
the voice of the foreman demanding three inches of wit and six lines 
of religious meditation, or bidding him turn off the wisdom and whack 
up some pathos.
  O, the Lord of Law on the Throne of Thought,
      A gilded impostor is he.
  Of shreds and patches his robes are wrought,
              His crown is brass,
              Himself an ass,
      And his power is fiddle-dee-dee.
  Prankily, crankily prating of naught,
  Silly old quilly old Monarch of Thought.
      Public opinion’s camp-follower he,
      Thundering, blundering, plundering free.
                  Affected,
                      Ungracious,
                  Suspected,
                      Mendacious,
  Respected contemporaree!
                                                    J.H. Bumbleshook
EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the 
foolish their lack of understanding.
EFFECT, n.  The second of two phenomena which always occur together in 
the same order.  The first, called a Cause, is said to generate the 
other — which is no more sensible than it would be for one who has 
never seen a dog except in the pursuit of a rabbit to declare the 
rabbit the cause of a dog.
EGOTIST, n.  A person of low taste, more interested in himself than in me.
  Megaceph, chosen to serve the State
  In the halls of legislative debate,
  One day with all his credentials came
  To the capitol’s door and announced his name.
  The doorkeeper looked, with a comical twist
  Of the face, at the eminent egotist,
  And said:  “Go away, for we settle here
  All manner of questions, knotty and queer,
  And we cannot have, when the speaker demands
  To be told how every member stands,
  A man who to all things under the sky
  Assents by eternally voting ’I’.”
EJECTION, n.  An approved remedy for the disease of garrulity.  It is 
also much used in cases of extreme poverty.
ELECTOR, n.  One who enjoys the sacred privilege of voting for the man 
of another man’s choice.
ELECTRICITY, n.  The power that causes all natural phenomena not known 
to be caused by something else.  It is the same thing as lightning, 
and its famous attempt to strike Dr. Franklin is one of the most 
picturesque incidents in that great and good man’s career.  The memory 
of Dr. Franklin is justly held in great reverence, particularly in 
France, where a waxen effigy of him was recently on exhibition, 
bearing the following touching account of his life and services to 
science:
      “Monsieur Franqulin, inventor of electricity.  This 
  illustrious savant, after having made several voyages around the 
  world, died on the Sandwich Islands and was devoured by savages, 
  of whom not a single fragment was ever recovered.”
  Electricity seems destined to play a most important part in the 
arts and industries.  The question of its economical application to 
some purposes is still unsettled, but experiment has already proved 
that it will propel a street car better than a gas jet and give more 
light than a horse.
ELEGY, n.  A composition in verse, in which, without employing any of 
the methods of humor, the writer aims to produce in the reader’s mind 
the dampest kind of dejection.  The most famous English example begins 
somewhat like this:
  The cur foretells the knell of parting day;
      The loafing herd winds slowly o’er the lea;
  The wise man homeward plods; I only stay
      To fiddle-faddle in a minor key.
ELOQUENCE, n.  The art of orally persuading fools that white is the 
color that it appears to be.  It includes the gift of making any color 
appear white.
ELYSIUM, n.  An imaginary delightful country which the ancients 
foolishly believed to be inhabited by the spirits of the good.  This 
ridiculous and mischievous fable was swept off the face of the earth 
by the early Christians — may their souls be happy in Heaven!
EMANCIPATION, n.  A bondman’s change from the tyranny of another to 
the despotism of himself.
  He was a slave:  at word he went and came;
      His iron collar cut him to the bone.
  Then Liberty erased his owner’s name,
      Tightened the rivets and inscribed his own.
G.J.

EMBALM, v.i.  To cheat vegetation by locking up the gases upon which 
it feeds.  By embalming their dead and thereby deranging the natural 
balance between animal and vegetable life, the Egyptians made their 
once fertile and populous country barren and incapable of supporting 
more than a meagre crew.  The modern metallic burial casket is a step 
in the same direction, and many a dead man who ought now to be 
ornamenting his neighbor’s lawn as a tree, or enriching his table as a 
bunch of radishes, is doomed to a long inutility.  We shall get him 
after awhile if we are spared, but in the meantime the violet and rose 
are languishing for a nibble at his glutoeus maximus.
EMOTION, n.  A prostrating disease caused by a determination of the 
heart to the head.  It is sometimes accompanied by a copious discharge 
of hydrated chloride of sodium from the eyes.
ENCOMIAST, n.  A special (but not particular) kind of liar.
END, n.  The position farthest removed on either hand from the 
Interlocutor.
  The man was perishing apace
      Who played the tambourine;
  The seal of death was on his face —
      ’Twas pallid, for ’twas clean.
  “This is the end,” the sick man said
      In faint and failing tones.
  A moment later he was dead,
      And Tambourine was Bones.
Tinley Roquot

ENOUGH, pro.  All there is in the world if you like it.
  Enough is as good as a feast — for that matter
  Enougher’s as good as a feast for the platter.
Arbely C. Strunk

ENTERTAINMENT, n.  Any kind of amusement whose inroads stop short of 
death by injection.
ENTHUSIASM, n.  A distemper of youth, curable by small doses of 
repentance in connection with outward applications of experience.  
Byron, who recovered long enough to call it “entuzy-muzy,” had a 
relapse, which carried him off — to Missolonghi.
ENVELOPE, n.  The coffin of a document; the scabbard of a bill; the 
husk of a remittance; the bed-gown of a love-letter.
ENVY, n.  Emulation adapted to the meanest capacity.
EPAULET, n.  An ornamented badge, serving to distinguish a military 
officer from the enemy — that is to say, from the officer of lower 
rank to whom his death would give promotion.
EPICURE, n.  An opponent of Epicurus, an abstemious philosopher who, 
holding that pleasure should be the chief aim of man, wasted no time 
in gratification from the senses.
EPIGRAM, n.  A short, sharp saying in prose or verse, frequently 
characterize by acidity or acerbity and sometimes by wisdom.  
Following are some of the more notable epigrams of the learned and 
ingenious Dr. Jamrach Holobom:
      We know better the needs of ourselves than of others.  To 
  serve oneself is economy of administration.
      In each human heart are a tiger, a pig, an ass and a 
  nightingale.  Diversity of character is due to their unequal 
  activity.
      There are three sexes; males, females and girls.
      Beauty in women and distinction in men are alike in this:  
  they seem to be the unthinking a kind of credibility.
      Women in love are less ashamed than men.  They have less to be 
  ashamed of.
      While your friend holds you affectionately by both your hands 
  you are safe, for you can watch both his.
EPITAPH, n.  An inscription on a tomb, showing that virtues acquired 
by death have a retroactive effect.  Following is a touching example:
  Here lie the bones of Parson Platt,
  Wise, pious, humble and all that,
  Who showed us life as all should live it;
  Let that be said — and God forgive it!
ERUDITION, n.  Dust shaken out of a book into an empty skull.
  So wide his erudition’s mighty span,
  He knew Creation’s origin and plan
  And only came by accident to grief —
  He thought, poor man, ’twas right to be a thief.
Romach Pute

ESOTERIC, adj.  Very particularly abstruse and consummately occult.  
The ancient philosophies were of two kinds, — exoteric, those that 
the philosophers themselves could partly understand, and esoteric, 
those that nobody could understand.  It is the latter that have most 
profoundly affected modern thought and found greatest acceptance in 
our time.
ETHNOLOGY, n.  The science that treats of the various tribes of Man, 
as robbers, thieves, swindlers, dunces, lunatics, idiots and 
ethnologists.
EUCHARIST, n.  A sacred feast of the religious sect of Theophagi.
  A dispute once unhappily arose among the members of this sect as 
to what it was that they ate.  In this controversy some five hundred 
thousand have already been slain, and the question is still unsettled.
EULOGY, n.  Praise of a person who has either the advantages of wealth 
and power, or the consideration to be dead.
EVANGELIST, n.  A bearer of good tidings, particularly (in a religious 
sense) such as assure us of our own salvation and the damnation of 
our neighbors.
EVERLASTING, adj.  Lasting forever.  It is with no small diffidence 
that I venture to offer this brief and elementary definition, for I am 
not unaware of the existence of a bulky volume by a sometime Bishop of 
Worcester, entitled, A Partial Definition of the Word “Everlasting,” 
as Used in the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.  His book 
was once esteemed of great authority in the Anglican Church, and is 
still, I understand, studied with pleasure to the mind and profit of 
the soul.
EXCEPTION, n.  A thing which takes the liberty to differ from other 
things of its class, as an honest man, a truthful woman, etc.  “The 
exception proves the rule” is an expression constantly upon the lips 
of the ignorant, who parrot it from one another with never a thought 
of its absurdity.  In the Latin, “Exceptio probat regulam” means 
that the exception tests the rule, puts it to the proof, not 
confirms it.  The malefactor who drew the meaning from this 
excellent dictum and substituted a contrary one of his own exerted an 
evil power which appears to be immortal.
EXCESS, n.  In morals, an indulgence that enforces by appropriate 
penalties the law of moderation.
  Hail, high Excess — especially in wine,
      To thee in worship do I bend the knee
      Who preach abstemiousness unto me —
  My skull thy pulpit, as my paunch thy shrine.
  Precept on precept, aye, and line on line,
      Could ne’er persuade so sweetly to agree
      With reason as thy touch, exact and free,
  Upon my forehead and along my spine.
  At thy command eschewing pleasure’s cup,
      With the hot grape I warm no more my wit;
      When on thy stool of penitence I sit
  I’m quite converted, for I can’t get up.
  Ungrateful he who afterward would falter
  To make new sacrifices at thine altar!
EXCOMMUNICATION, n.
  This “excommunication” is a word
  In speech ecclesiastical oft heard,
  And means the damning, with bell, book and candle,
  Some sinner whose opinions are a scandal —
  A rite permitting Satan to enslave him
  Forever, and forbidding Christ to save him.
Gat Huckle

EXECUTIVE, n.  An officer of the Government, whose duty it is to 
enforce the wishes of the legislative power until such time as the 
judicial department shall be pleased to pronounce them invalid and of 
no effect.  Following is an extract from an old book entitled, The 
Lunarian Astonished — Pfeiffer & Co., Boston, 1803:
  LUNARIAN:  Then when your Congress has passed a law it goes 
      directly to the Supreme Court in order that it may at once be 
      known whether it is constitutional?
  TERRESTRIAN:  O no; it does not require the approval of the 
      Supreme Court until having perhaps been enforced for many 
      years somebody objects to its operation against himself — I 
      mean his client.  The President, if he approves it, begins to 
      execute it at once.
  LUNARIAN:  Ah, the executive power is a part of the legislative.  
      Do your policemen also have to approve the local ordinances 
      that they enforce?
  TERRESTRIAN:  Not yet — at least not in their character of 
      constables.  Generally speaking, though, all laws require the 
      approval of those whom they are intended to restrain.
  LUNARIAN:  I see.  The death warrant is not valid until signed by 
      the murderer.
  TERRESTRIAN:  My friend, you put it too strongly; we are not so 
      consistent.
  LUNARIAN:  But this system of maintaining an expensive judicial 
      machinery to pass upon the validity of laws only after they 
      have long been executed, and then only when brought before the 
      court by some private person — does it not cause great 
      confusion?
  TERRESTRIAN:  It does.
  LUNARIAN:  Why then should not your laws, previously to being 
      executed, be validated, not by the signature of your 
      President, but by that of the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
      Court?
  TERRESTRIAN:  There is no precedent for any such course.
  LUNARIAN:  Precedent.  What is that?
  TERRESTRIAN:  It has been defined by five hundred lawyers in three 
      volumes each.  So how can any one know?
EXHORT, v.t. In religious affairs, to put the conscience of another 
upon the spit and roast it to a nut-brown discomfort.
EXILE, n.  One who serves his country by residing abroad, yet is not 
an ambassador.
  An English sea-captain being asked if he had read “The Exile of 
Erin,” replied:  “No, sir, but I should like to anchor on it.”  Years 
afterwards, when he had been hanged as a pirate after a career of 
unparalleled atrocities, the following memorandum was found in the 
ship’s log that he had kept at the time of his reply:
  Aug. 3d, 1842.  Made a joke on the ex-Isle of Erin.  Coldly 
  received.  War with the whole world!
EXISTENCE, n.
  A transient, horrible, fantastic dream,
  Wherein is nothing yet all things do seem:
  From which we’re wakened by a friendly nudge
  Of our bedfellow Death, and cry:  “O fudge!”
EXPERIENCE, n.  The wisdom that enables us to recognize as an 
undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced.
  To one who, journeying through night and fog,
  Is mired neck-deep in an unwholesome bog,
  Experience, like the rising of the dawn,
  Reveals the path that he should not have gone.
Joel Frad Bink

EXPOSTULATION, n.  One of the many methods by which fools prefer to 
lose their friends.
EXTINCTION, n.  The raw material out of which theology created the 
future state.
