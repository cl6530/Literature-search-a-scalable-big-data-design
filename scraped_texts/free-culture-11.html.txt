Jon Else is a filmmaker. He is best known for his documentaries and has been 
very successful in spreading his art. He is also a teacher, and as a teacher 
myself, I envy the loyalty and admiration that his students feel for him. (I 
met, by accident, two of his students at a dinner party. He was their god.)
Else worked on a documentary that I was involved in. At a break, he told me a 
story about the freedom to create with film in America today.
In 1990, Else was working on a documentary about Wagner’s Ring Cycle. The focus 
was stagehands at the San Francisco Opera. Stage- hands are a particularly funny 
and colorful element of an opera. During a show, they hang out below the stage 
in the grips’ lounge and in the lighting loft. They make a perfect contrast to 
the art on the stage.
During one of the performances, Else was shooting some stage- hands playing 
checkers. In one corner of the room was a television set. Playing on the 
television set, while the stagehands played checkers and the opera company 
played Wagner, was The Simpsons. As Else judged it, this touch of cartoon 
helped capture the flavor of what was special about the scene.
Years later, when he finally got funding to complete the film, Else attempted to 
clear the rights for those few seconds of The Simpsons. For of course, those 
few seconds are copyrighted; and of course, to use copyrighted material you need 
the permission of the copyright owner, unless fair use or some other privilege 
applies.
Else called Simpsons creator Matt Groening’s office to get permission. 
Groening approved the shot. The shot was a four-and-a-half-second image on a 
tiny television set in the corner of the room. How could it hurt? Groening was 
happy to have it in the film, but he told Else to contact Gracie Films, the 
company that produces the program.
Gracie Films was okay with it, too, but they, like Groening, wanted to be 
careful. So they told Else to contact Fox, Gracie’s parent company. Else called 
Fox and told them about the clip in the corner of the one room shot of the film. 
Matt Groening had already given permission, Else said. He was just confirming 
the permission with Fox.
Then, as Else told me, two things happened. First we discovered ... that Matt 
Groening doesn’t own his own creationor at least that someone [at Fox] believes 
he doesn’t own his own creation. And second, Fox wanted ten thousand dollars 
as a licensing fee for us to use this four-point-five seconds of ... entirely 
unsolicited Simpsons which was in the corner of the shot.
Else was certain there was a mistake. He worked his way up to someone he thought 
was a vice president for licensing, Rebecca Herrera. He explained to her, There 
must be some mistake here. ... We’re asking for your educational rate on this. 
That was the educational rate, Herrera told Else. A day or so later, Else called 
again to confirm what he had been told.
I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight, he told me. Yes, you have your 
facts straight, she said. It would cost $10,000 to use the clip of The 
Simpsons in the corner of a shot in a documentary film about Wagner’s Ring 
Cycle. And then, astonishingly, Herrera told Else, And if you quote me, I’ll 
turn you over to our attorneys. As an assistant to Herrera told Else later on, 
They don’t give a shit. They just want the money.
Else didn’t have the money to buy the right to replay what was playing on the 
television backstage at the San Francisco Opera.To reproduce this reality was 
beyond the documentary filmmaker’s budget. At the very last minute before the 
film was to be released, Else digitally replaced the shot with a clip from 
another film that he had worked on, The Day After Trinity, from ten years 
before.
There’s no doubt that someone, whether Matt Groening or Fox, owns the copyright 
to The Simpsons. That copyright is their property. To use that copyrighted 
material thus sometimes requires the permission of the copyright owner. If the 
use that Else wanted to make of the Simpsons copyright were one of the uses 
restricted by the law, then he would need to get the permission of the copyright 
owner before he could use the work in that way. And in a free market, it is the 
owner of the copyright who gets to set the price for any use that the law says 
the owner gets to control.
For example, public performance is a use of The Simpsons that the copyright 
owner gets to control. If you take a selection of favorite episodes, rent a 
movie theater, and charge for tickets to come see My Favorite Simpsons, then 
you need to get permission from the copyright owner. And the copyright owner 
(rightly, in my view) can charge whatever she wants$10 or $1,000,000. That’s 
her right, as set by the law.
But when lawyers hear this story about Jon Else and Fox, their first thought is 
fair use. [1] Else’s use of just 4.5 seconds of an indirect shot of a 
Simpsons episode is clearly a fair use of The Simpsonsand fair use does not 
require the permission of anyone.
So I asked Else why he didn’t just rely upon fair use. Here’s his reply:
The Simpsons fiasco was for me a great lesson in the gulf between what 
lawyers find irrelevant in some abstract sense, and what is crushingly relevant 
in practice to those of us actually trying to make and broadcast documentaries. 
I never had any doubt that it was clearly fair use in an absolute legal sense. 
But I couldn’t rely on the concept in any concrete way. Here’s why:
1. Before our films can be broadcast, the network requires that we buy Errors 
and Omissions insurance. The carriers require a detailed visual cue sheet 
listing the source and licensing status of each shot in the film. They take a 
dim view of fair use, and a claim of fair use can grind the application 
process to a halt.
2. I probably never should have asked Matt Groening in the first place. But I 
knew (at least from folklore) that Fox had a history of tracking down and 
stopping unlicensed Simpsons usage, just as George Lucas had a very high 
profile litigating Star Wars usage. So I decided to play by the book, thinking 
that we would be granted free or cheap license to four seconds of Simpsons. As 
a documentary producer working to exhaustion on a shoestring, the last thing I 
wanted was to risk legal trouble, even nuisance legal trouble, and even to 
defend a principle.
3. I did, in fact, speak with one of your colleagues at Stanford Law School ... 
who confirmed that it was fair use. He also confirmed that Fox would depose and 
litigate you to within an inch of your life, regardless of the merits of my 
claim. He made clear that it would boil down to who had the bigger legal 
department and the deeper pockets, me or them.
4. The question of fair use usually comes up at the end of the project, when we 
are up against a release deadline and out of money.
In theory, fair use means you need no permission. The theory therefore supports 
free culture and insulates against a permission culture. But in practice, fair 
use functions very differently. The fuzzy lines of the law, tied to the 
extraordinary liability if lines are crossed, means that the effective fair use 
for many types of creators is slight. The law has the right aim; practice has 
defeated the aim.
This practice shows just how far the law has come from its eighteenth-century 
roots. The law was born as a shield to protect publishers’ profits against the 
unfair competition of a pirate. It has matured into a sword that interferes with 
any use, transformative or not.
