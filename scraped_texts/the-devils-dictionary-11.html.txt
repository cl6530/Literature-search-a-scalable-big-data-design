J is a consonant in English, but some nations use it as a vowel — 
than which nothing could be more absurd.  Its original form, which has 
been but slightly modified, was that of the tail of a subdued dog, and 
it was not a letter but a character, standing for a Latin verb, 
jacere, “to throw,” because when a stone is thrown at a dog the 
dog’s tail assumes that shape.  This is the origin of the letter, as 
expounded by the renowned Dr. Jocolpus Bumer, of the University of 
Belgrade, who established his conclusions on the subject in a work of 
three quarto volumes and committed suicide on being reminded that the 
j in the Roman alphabet had originally no curl.
JEALOUS, adj.  Unduly concerned about the preservation of that which 
can be lost only if not worth keeping.
JESTER, n.  An officer formerly attached to a king’s household, whose 
business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and 
utterances, the absurdity being attested by his motley costume.  The 
king himself being attired with dignity, it took the world some 
centuries to discover that his own conduct and decrees were 
sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement not only of his court but of 
all mankind.  The jester was commonly called a fool, but the poets and 
romancers have ever delighted to represent him as a singularly wise 
and witty person.  In the circus of to-day the melancholy ghost of the 
court fool effects the dejection of humbler audiences with the same 
jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble hall, panged the 
patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal tears.
  The widow-queen of Portugal
      Had an audacious jester
  Who entered the confessional
      Disguised, and there confessed her.
  “Father,” she said, “thine ear bend down —
      My sins are more than scarlet:
  I love my fool — blaspheming clown,
      And common, base-born varlet.”
  “Daughter,” the mimic priest replied,
      “That sin, indeed, is awful:
  The church’s pardon is denied
      To love that is unlawful.
  “But since thy stubborn heart will be
      For him forever pleading,
  Thou’dst better make him, by decree,
      A man of birth and breeding.”
  She made the fool a duke, in hope
      With Heaven’s taboo to palter;
  Then told a priest, who told the Pope,
      Who damned her from the altar!
