“The site was something I would never have thought to look for but as
I’ve seen it now it has been a wee surprise. I work offshore on a
pipe-laying vessel and spend six weeks at a time at sea, now I have a
little library of works to read that I print off and use in my off
shift.
The other guys on-board are using it too and it’s thanks to yourself
we’ve got some interesting reading.”
– Brian McGuire
