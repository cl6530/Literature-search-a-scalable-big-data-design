This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a Brother who had
ceased striving after righteousness. Said the Teacher to him: “Is it
really true that you have ceased all striving?"–"Yes, Blessed One,” he
replied. Then the Teacher said: “O Brother, in former days wise men
made effort in the place where effort should be made, and so attained
unto royal power.” And he told a story of long ago.
Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was King of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born as son of his chief queen. On his name-day they asked 800
Brahmans, having satisfied them with all their desires, about his lucky
marks. The Brahmans who had skill in divining from such marks beheld
the excellence of his, and made answer:
“Full of goodness, great King, is your son, and when you die he will
become king; he shall be famous and renowned for his skill with the
five weapons, and shall be the chief man in all India.” On hearing what
the Brahmans had to say, they gave him the name of the Prince of the
Five Weapons, sword, spear, bow, battle-axe, and shield.
When he came to years of discretion, and had attained the measure of
sixteen years, the King said to him:
“My son, go and complete your education.”
“Who shall be my teacher?” the lad asked.
“Go, my son; in the kingdom of Candahar, in the city of Takkasila, is a
far-famed teacher from whom I wish you to learn. Take this, and give it
him for a fee.” With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money, and
dismissed him.
The lad departed, and was educated by this teacher; he received the
Five Weapons from him as a gift, bade him farewell, and leaving
Takkasila, he began his journey to Benares, armed with the Five
Weapons.
On his way he came to a forest inhabited by the Demon with the Matted
Hair. At the entering in of the forest some men saw him, and cried out:
“Hullo, young sir, keep clear of that wood! There’s a Demon in it
called he of the Matted Hair: he kills every man he sees!” And they
tried to stop him. But the Bodhisatta, having confidence in himself,
went straight on, fearless as a maned lion.
When he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself. He made himself as
tall as a palm tree; his head was the size of a pagoda, his eyes as big
as saucers, and he had two tusks all over knobs and bulbs; he had the
face of a hawk, a variegated belly, and blue hands and feet.
“Where are you going?” he shouted. “Stop! You’ll make a meal for me!”
Said the Bodhisatta: “Demon, I came here trusting in myself. I advise
you to be careful how you come near me. Here’s a poisoned arrow, which
I’ll shoot at you and knock you down!” With this menace, he fitted to
his bow an arrow dipped in deadly poison, and let fly. The arrow stuck
fast in the Demon’s hair. Then he shot and shot, till he had shot away
fifty arrows; and they all stuck in the Demon’s hair. The Demon snapped
them all off short, and threw them down at his feet; then came up to
the Bodhisatta, who drew his sword and struck the Demon, threatening
him the while. His sword–it was three-and-thirty inches long–stuck in
the Demon’s hair! The Bodhisatta struck him with his spear–that stuck
too! He struck him with his club–and that stuck too!
When the Bodhisatta saw that this had stuck fast, he addressed the
Demon. “You, Demon!” said he, “did you never hear of me before–the
Prince of the Five Weapons? When I came into the forest which you live
in I did not trust to my bow and other weapons. This day will I pound
you and grind you to powder!” Thus did he declare his resolve, and with
a shout he hit at the Demon with his right hand. It stuck fast in his
hair! He hit him with his left hand–that stuck too! With his right
foot he kicked him–that stuck too; then with his left–and that stuck
too! Then he butted at him with his head, crying, “I’ll pound you to
powder!” and his head stuck fast like the rest.
Thus the Bodhisatta was five times snared, caught fast in five places,
hanging suspended: yet he felt no fear–was not even nervous.
Thought the Demon to himself: “Here’s a lion of a man! A noble man!
More than man is he! Here he is, caught by a Demon like me; yet he will
not fear a bit. Since I have ravaged this road, I never saw such a man.
Now, why is it that he does not fear?” He was powerless to eat the man,
but asked him: “Why is it, young sir, that you are not frightened to
death?”
“Why should I fear, Demon?” replied he. “In one life a man can die but
once. Besides, in my belly is a thunderbolt; if you eat me, you will
never be able to digest it; this will tear your inwards into little
bits, and kill you: so we shall both perish. That is why I fear
nothing.” (By this, the Bodhisatta meant the weapon of knowledge which
he had within him.)
When he heard this, the Demon thought: “This young man speaks the
truth. A piece of the flesh of such a lion-man as he would be too much
for me to digest, if it were no bigger than a kidney-bean. I’ll let him
go!” So, being frightened to death, he let go the Bodhisatta, saying
“Young sir, you are a lion of a man! I will not eat you up. I set you
free from my hands, as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rahu
after the eclipse. Go back to the company of your friends and
relations!”
And the Bodhisatta said: “Demon, I will go, as you say. You were born a
Demon, cruel, blood-bibbing, devourer of the flesh and gore of others,
because you did wickedly in former lives. If you still go on doing
wickedly, you will go from darkness to darkness. But now that you have
seen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly. Taking the life of
living creatures causes birth, as an animal, in the world of Petas, or
in the body of an Asura, or, if one is reborn as a man, it makes his
life short.” With this and the like monition he told him the
disadvantage of the five kinds of wickedness, and the profit of the
five kinds of virtue, and frightened the Demon in various ways,
discoursing to him until he subdued him and made him self-denying, and
established him in the five kinds of virtue; he made him worship the
deity to whom offerings were made in that wood; and having carefully
admonished him, departed out of it.
At the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout; and
went on to Benares, armed with his five weapons. Afterwards he became
king, and ruled righteously; and after giving alms and doing good he
passed away according to his deeds.
And the Teacher, when this tale was ended, became perfectly
enlightened, and repeated this verse:
  Whose mind and heart from all desire is free,
  Who seeks for peace by living virtuously,
    He in due time will sever all the bonds
  That bind him fast to life, and cease to be.
Thus the Teacher reached the summit, through sainthood and the teaching
of the law, and thereupon he declared the Four Truths. At the end of
the declaring of the Truths, this Brother also attained to sainthood.
Then the Teacher made the connexion, and gave the key to the birth-
tale, saying: “At that time Angulimala was the Demon, but the Prance of
the Five Weapons was I myself.”
