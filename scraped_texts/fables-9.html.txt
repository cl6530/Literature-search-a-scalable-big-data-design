FOUR reformers met under a bramble bush.  They were all agreed the 
world must be changed.  “We must abolish property,” said one.
“We must abolish marriage,” said the second.
“We must abolish God,” said the third.
“I wish we could abolish work,” said the fourth.
“Do not let us get beyond practical politics,” said the first.  
“The first thing is to reduce men to a common level.”
“The first thing,” said the second, “is to give freedom to the 
sexes.”
“The first thing,” said the third, “is to find out how to do it.”
“The first step,” said the first, “is to abolish the Bible.”
“The first thing,” said the second, “is to abolish the laws.”
“The first thing,” said the third, “is to abolish mankind.”

“Oh, he had always a nasty tongue,” said the man.
