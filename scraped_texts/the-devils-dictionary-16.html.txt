OATH, n.  In law, a solemn appeal to the Deity, made binding upon the 
conscience by a penalty for perjury.
OBLIVION, n.  The state or condition in which the wicked cease from 
struggling and the dreary are at rest.  Fame’s eternal dumping ground.  
Cold storage for high hopes.  A place where ambitious authors meet 
their works without pride and their betters without envy.  A dormitory 
without an alarm clock.
OBSERVATORY, n.  A place where astronomers conjecture away the guesses 
of their predecessors.
OBSESSED, p.p.  Vexed by an evil spirit, like the Gadarene swine and 
other critics.  Obsession was once more common than it is now.  
Arasthus tells of a peasant who was occupied by a different devil for 
every day in the week, and on Sundays by two.  They were frequently 
seen, always walking in his shadow, when he had one, but were finally 
driven away by the village notary, a holy man; but they took the 
peasant with them, for he vanished utterly.  A devil thrown out of a 
woman by the Archbishop of Rheims ran through the trees, pursued by a 
hundred persons, until the open country was reached, where by a leap 
higher than a church spire he escaped into a bird.  A chaplain in 
Cromwell’s army exorcised a soldier’s obsessing devil by throwing the 
soldier into the water, when the devil came to the surface.  The 
soldier, unfortunately, did not.
OBSOLETE, adj.  No longer used by the timid.  Said chiefly of words.  
A word which some lexicographer has marked obsolete is ever thereafter 
an object of dread and loathing to the fool writer, but if it is a 
good word and has no exact modern equivalent equally good, it is good 
enough for the good writer.  Indeed, a writer’s attitude toward 
“obsolete” words is as true a measure of his literary ability as 
anything except the character of his work.  A dictionary of obsolete 
and obsolescent words would not only be singularly rich in strong and 
sweet parts of speech; it would add large possessions to the 
vocabulary of every competent writer who might not happen to be a 
competent reader.
OBSTINATE, adj.  Inaccessible to the truth as it is manifest in the 
splendor and stress of our advocacy.
  The popular type and exponent of obstinacy is the mule, a most 
intelligent animal.
OCCASIONAL, adj.  Afflicting us with greater or less frequency.  That, 
however, is not the sense in which the word is used in the phrase 
“occasional verses,” which are verses written for an “occasion,” such 
as an anniversary, a celebration or other event.  True, they afflict 
us a little worse than other sorts of verse, but their name has no 
reference to irregular recurrence.
OCCIDENT, n.  The part of the world lying west (or east) of the 
Orient.  It is largely inhabited by Christians, a powerful subtribe of 
the Hypocrites, whose principal industries are murder and cheating, 
which they are pleased to call “war” and “commerce.”  These, also, are 
the principal industries of the Orient.
OCEAN, n.  A body of water occupying about two-thirds of a world made 
for man — who has no gills.
OFFENSIVE, adj.  Generating disagreeable emotions or sensations, as 
the advance of an army against its enemy.
  “Were the enemy’s tactics offensive?” the king asked.  “I should 
say so!” replied the unsuccessful general.  “The blackguard wouldn’t 
come out of his works!”
OLD, adj.  In that stage of usefulness which is not inconsistent with 
general inefficiency, as an old man.  Discredited by lapse of time 
and offensive to the popular taste, as an old book.
  “Old books?  The devil take them!” Goby said.
  “Fresh every day must be my books and bread."
  Nature herself approves the Goby rule
  And gives us every moment a fresh fool.
Harley Shum

OLEAGINOUS, adj.  Oily, smooth, sleek.
  Disraeli once described the manner of Bishop Wilberforce as 
“unctuous, oleaginous, saponaceous.”  And the good prelate was ever 
afterward known as Soapy Sam.  For every man there is something in the 
vocabulary that would stick to him like a second skin.  His enemies 
have only to find it.
OLYMPIAN, adj.  Relating to a mountain in Thessaly, once inhabited by 
gods, now a repository of yellowing newspapers, beer bottles and 
mutilated sardine cans, attesting the presence of the tourist and his 
appetite.
  His name the smirking tourist scrawls
  Upon Minerva’s temple walls,
  Where thundered once Olympian Zeus,
  And marks his appetite’s abuse.
Averil Joop

OMEN, n.  A sign that something will happen if nothing happens.
ONCE, adv.  Enough.
OPERA, n.  A play representing life in another world, whose 
inhabitants have no speech but song, no motions but gestures and no 
postures but attitudes.  All acting is simulation, and the word 
simulation is from simia, an ape; but in opera the actor takes for 
his model Simia audibilis (or Pithecanthropos stentor) — the ape 
that howls.
  The actor apes a man — at least in shape;
  The opera performer apes and ape.
OPIATE, n.  An unlocked door in the prison of Identity.  It leads into 
the jail yard.
OPPORTUNITY, n.  A favorable occasion for grasping a disappointment.
OPPOSE, v.  To assist with obstructions and objections.
  How lonely he who thinks to vex
  With bandinage the Solemn Sex!
  Of levity, Mere Man, beware;
  None but the Grave deserve the Unfair.
Percy P. Orminder

OPPOSITION, n.  In politics the party that prevents the Government from 
running amuck by hamstringing it.
  The King of Ghargaroo, who had been abroad to study the science of 
government, appointed one hundred of his fattest subjects as members 
of a parliament to make laws for the collection of revenue.  Forty of 
these he named the Party of Opposition and had his Prime Minister 
carefully instruct them in their duty of opposing every royal measure.  
Nevertheless, the first one that was submitted passed unanimously.  
Greatly displeased, the King vetoed it, informing the Opposition that 
if they did that again they would pay for their obstinacy with their 
heads.  The entire forty promptly disemboweled themselves.
  “What shall we do now?” the King asked.  “Liberal institutions 
cannot be maintained without a party of Opposition."
  “Splendor of the universe,” replied the Prime Minister, “it is 
true these dogs of darkness have no longer their credentials, but all 
is not lost.  Leave the matter to this worm of the dust."
  So the Minister had the bodies of his Majesty’s Opposition 
embalmed and stuffed with straw, put back into the seats of power and 
nailed there.  Forty votes were recorded against every bill and the 
nation prospered.  But one day a bill imposing a tax on warts was 
defeated — the members of the Government party had not been nailed to 
their seats!  This so enraged the King that the Prime Minister was put 
to death, the parliament was dissolved with a battery of artillery, 
and government of the people, by the people, for the people perished 
from Ghargaroo.
OPTIMISM, n.  The doctrine, or belief, that everything is beautiful, 
including what is ugly, everything good, especially the bad, and 
everything right that is wrong.  It is held with greatest tenacity by 
those most accustomed to the mischance of falling into adversity, and 
is most acceptably expounded with the grin that apes a smile.  Being a 
blind faith, it is inaccessible to the light of disproof — an 
intellectual disorder, yielding to no treatment but death.  It is 
hereditary, but fortunately not contagious.
OPTIMIST, n.  A proponent of the doctrine that black is white.
  A pessimist applied to God for relief.
  “Ah, you wish me to restore your hope and cheerfulness,” said God.
  “No,” replied the petitioner, “I wish you to create something that 
would justify them."
  “The world is all created,” said God, “but you have overlooked 
something — the mortality of the optimist.”
ORATORY, n.  A conspiracy between speech and action to cheat the 
understanding.  A tyranny tempered by stenography.
ORPHAN, n.  A living person whom death has deprived of the power of 
filial ingratitude — a privation appealing with a particular 
eloquence to all that is sympathetic in human nature.  When young the 
orphan is commonly sent to an asylum, where by careful cultivation of 
its rudimentary sense of locality it is taught to know its place.  It 
is then instructed in the arts of dependence and servitude and 
eventually turned loose to prey upon the world as a bootblack or 
scullery maid.
ORTHODOX, n.  An ox wearing the popular religious joke.
ORTHOGRAPHY, n.  The science of spelling by the eye instead of the 
ear.  Advocated with more heat than light by the outmates of every 
asylum for the insane.  They have had to concede a few things since 
the time of Chaucer, but are none the less hot in defence of those to 
be conceded hereafter.
  A spelling reformer indicted
  For fudge was before the court cicted.
      The judge said:  “Enough —
      His candle we’ll snough,
  And his sepulchre shall not be whicted.”
OSTRICH, n.  A large bird to which (for its sins, doubtless) nature 
has denied that hinder toe in which so many pious naturalists have 
seen a conspicuous evidence of design.  The absence of a good working 
pair of wings is no defect, for, as has been ingeniously pointed out, 
the ostrich does not fly.
OTHERWISE, adv.  No better.
OUTCOME, n.  A particular type of disappointment.  By the kind of 
intelligence that sees in an exception a proof of the rule the wisdom 
of an act is judged by the outcome, the result.  This is immortal 
nonsense; the wisdom of an act is to be juded by the light that the 
doer had when he performed it.
OUTDO, v.t.  To make an enemy.
OUT-OF-DOORS, n.  That part of one’s environment upon which no 
government has been able to collect taxes.  Chiefly useful to inspire 
poets.
  I climbed to the top of a mountain one day
      To see the sun setting in glory,
  And I thought, as I looked at his vanishing ray,
      Of a perfectly splendid story.
  ’Twas about an old man and the ass he bestrode
      Till the strength of the beast was o’ertested;
  Then the man would carry him miles on the road
      Till Neddy was pretty well rested.
  The moon rising solemnly over the crest
      Of the hills to the east of my station
  Displayed her broad disk to the darkening west
      Like a visible new creation.
  And I thought of a joke (and I laughed till I cried)
      Of an idle young woman who tarried
  About a church-door for a look at the bride,
      Although ’twas herself that was married.
  To poets all Nature is pregnant with grand
      Ideas — with thought and emotion.
  I pity the dunces who don’t understand
      The speech of earth, heaven and ocean.
Stromboli Smith

OVATION, n.  n ancient Rome, a definite, formal pageant in honor of 
one who had been disserviceable to the enemies of the nation.  A 
lesser “triumph.”  In modern English the word is improperly used to 
signify any loose and spontaneous expression of popular homage to the 
hero of the hour and place.
  “I had an ovation!” the actor man said,
      But I thought it uncommonly queer,
  That people and critics by him had been led
          By the ear.
  The Latin lexicon makes his absurd
      Assertion as plain as a peg;
  In “ovum” we find the true root of the word.
          It means egg.
Dudley Spink

OVEREAT, v.  To dine.
  Hail, Gastronome, Apostle of Excess,
  Well skilled to overeat without distress!
  Thy great invention, the unfatal feast,
  Shows Man’s superiority to Beast.
John Boop

OVERWORK, n.  A dangerous disorder affecting high public functionaries 
who want to go fishing.
OWE, v.  To have (and to hold) a debt.  The word formerly signified 
not indebtedness, but possession; it meant “own,” and in the minds of 
debtors there is still a good deal of confusion between assets and 
liabilities.
OYSTER, n.  A slimy, gobby shellfish which civilization gives men the 
hardihood to eat without removing its entrails!  The shells are 
sometimes given to the poor.
