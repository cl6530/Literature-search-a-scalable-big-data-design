8. This is not the only purpose of copyright, though it is the overwhelmingly 
primary purpose of the copyright established in the federal constitution. State 
copyright law historically protected not just the commercial interest in 
publication, but also a privacy interest. By granting authors the exclusive 
right to first publication, state copyright law gave authors the power to 
control the spread of facts about them. See Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. 
Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, Harvard Law Review 4 (1890): 193, 198-200.

4. In The Rise of the Creative Class (New York: Basic Books, 2002), Richard 
Florida documents a shift in the nature of labor toward a labor of creativity. 
His work, however, doesn’t directly address the legal conditions under which 
that creativity is enabled or stifled. I certainly agree with him about the 
importance and significance of this change, but I also believe the conditions 
under which it will be enabled are much more tenuous.

2. I am grateful to David Gerstein and his careful history, described at link 
#4. According to Dave Smith of the Disney Archives, Disney paid royalties to use 
the music for five songs in Steamboat Willie: Steamboat Bill, The 
Simpleton (Delille), Mischief Makers (Carbonara), Joyful Hurry No. 1 
(Baron), and Gawky Rube (Lakay). A sixth song, The Turkey in the Straw, was 
already in the public domain. Letter from David Smith to Harry Surden, 10 July 
2003, on file with author.
3. He was also a fan of the public domain. See Chris Sprigman, The Mouse that 
Ate the Public Domain, Findlaw, 5 March 2002, at link #5.
4. Until 1976, copyright law granted an author the possibility of two terms: an 
initial term and a renewal term. I have calculated the average term by 
determining the weighted average of total registrations for any particular year, 
and the proportion renewing. Thus, if 100 copyrights are registered in year 1, 
and only 15 are renewed, and the renewal term is 28 years, then the average term 
is 32.2 years. For the renewal data and other relevant data, see the Web site 
associated with this book, available at link #6.

manga and anime artists to forgo bringing legal actions for infringement. One 
hypothesis is that all manga artists may be better off collectively if they set 
aside their individual self-interest and decide not to press their legal rights. 
This is essentially a prisoner’s dilemma solved.
7. The term intellectual property is of relatively recent origin. See Siva 
Vaidhyanathan, Copyrights and Copywrongs, 11 (New York: New York University 
Press, 2001). See also Lawrence Lessig, The Future of Ideas (New York: Random 
House, 2001), 293 n. 26. The term accurately describes a set of property 
rightscopyright, patents, trademark, and trade-secretbut the nature of those 
rights is very different.

2. See Peter Drahos with John Braithwaite, Information Feudalism: Who Owns the 
Knowledge Economy? (New York: The New Press, 2003), 10-13, 209. The Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement obligates 
member nations to create administrative and enforcement mechanisms for 
intellectual property rights, a costly proposition for developing countries. 
Additionally, patent rights may lead to higher prices for staple industries such 
as agriculture. Critics of TRIPS question the disparity between burdens imposed 
upon developing countries and benefits conferred to industrialized nations. 
TRIPS does permit governments to use patents for public, noncommercial uses 
without first obtaining the patent holder’s permission. Developing nations may 
be able to use this to gain the benefits of foreign patents at lower prices. 
This is a promising strategy for developing nations within the TRIPS framework.
3. For an analysis of the economic impact of copying technology, see Stan 
Liebowitz, Rethinking the Network Economy (New York: Amacom, 2002), 144-90. 
In some instances ... the impact of piracy on the copyright holder’s ability to 
appropriate the value of the work will be negligible. One obvious instance is 
the case where the individual engaging in pirating would not have purchased an 
original even if pirating were not an option. Ibid., 149.

5. See Clayton M. Christensen, The Innovator’s Dilemma: The Revolutionary 
National Bestseller That Changed the Way We Do Business (New York:

rise to and dominate a product area are frequently unable to come up with the 
most creative, paradigm-shifting uses for their own products. This job usually 
falls to outside innovators, who reassemble existing technology in inventive 
ways. For a discussion of Christensen’s ideas, see Lawrence Lessig, Future, 
89-92, 139.

24. These are the most important instances in our history, but there are other 
cases as well. The technology of digital audio tape (DAT), for example, was 
regulated by Congress to minimize the risk of piracy. The remedy Congress 
imposed did burden DAT producers, by taxing tape sales and controlling the 
technology of DAT. See Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (Title 17 of the United 
States Code), Pub. L. No. 102-563, 106 Stat. 4237, codified at 17 U.S.C. §1001.

2. As the legal realists taught American law, all property rights are 
intangible. A property right is simply a right that an individual has against 
the world to do or not do certain things that may or may not attach to a 
physical object. The right itself is intangible, even if the object to which it 
is (metaphorically) attached is tangible. See Adam Mossoff, What Is Property?

2. Lawyers speak of property not as an absolute thing, but as a bundle of 
rights that are sometimes associated with a particular object. Thus, my 
property right to my car gives me the right to exclusive use, but not the 
right to drive at 150 miles an hour. For the best effort to connect the ordinary 
meaning of property to lawyer talk, see Bruce Ackerman, Private Property 
and the Constitution (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977), 26-27.
3. By describing the way law affects the other three modalities, I don’t mean to 
suggest that the other three don’t affect law. Obviously, they do. Law’s only 
distinction is that it alone speaks as if it has a right self-consciously to 
change the other three. The right of the other three is more timidly expressed. 
See Lawrence Lessig, Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace (New York: Basic 
Books, 1999): 90-95; Lawrence Lessig, The New Chicago School, Journal of 
Legal Studies, June 1998.
4. Some people object to this way of talking about liberty. They object 
because their focus when considering the constraints that exist at any 
particular moment are constraints imposed exclusively by the government. For 
instance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people think it is meaningless to 
say that one’s liberty has been restrained. A bridge has washed out, and it’s 
harder to get from one place to another. To talk about this as a loss of 
freedom, they say, is to confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries of 
ordinary life.
I don’t mean to deny the value in this narrower view, which depends upon the 
context of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to argue against any insistence that 
this narrower view is the only proper view of liberty. As I argued in Code, we 
come from a long tradition of political thought with a broader focus than the 
narrow question of what the government did when. John Stuart Mill defended 
freedom of speech, for example, from the tyranny of narrow minds, not from the 
fear of government prosecution; John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (Indiana: Hackett 
Publishing Co., 1978), 19. John R. Commons famously defended the economic 
freedom of labor from constraints imposed by the market; John R. Commons, The 
Right to Work, in Malcom Rutherford and Warren J. Samuels, eds., John R. 
Commons: Selected Essays (London: Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans with 
Disabilities Act increases the liberty of people with physical disabilities by 
changing the architecture of certain public places, thereby making access to 
those places easier; 42 United States Code, section 12101 (2000). Each of 
these interventions to change existing conditions changes the liberty of a 
particular group. The effect of those interventions should be accounted for in 
order to understand the effective liberty that each of these groups might face.

perpetual rights which authors had, or were supposed by some to have, under the 
Common Law/ (emphasis added).
9. Although 13,000 titles were published in the United States from 1790 to 1799, 
only 556 copyright registrations were filed; John Tebbel, A History of Book 
Publishing in the United States, vol. 1, The Creation of an Industry, 1630-
1865 (New York: Bowker, 1972), 141. Of the 21,000 imprints recorded before 
1790, only twelve were copyrighted under the 1790 act; William J. Maher, 
/Copyright Term, Retrospective Extension and the Copyright Law of 1790 in 
Historical Context, 7-10 (2002), available at link #25. Thus, the overwhelming 
majority of works fell immediately into the public domain. Even those works that 
were copyrighted fell into the public domain quickly, because the term of 
copyright was short. The initial term of copyright was fourteen years, with the 
option of renewal for an additional fourteen years. Copyright Act of May 31, 
1790, §1, 1 stat. 124.
10. Few copyright holders ever chose to renew their copyrights. For instance, of 
the 25,006 copyrights registered in 1883, only 894 were renewed in 1910. For a 
year-by-year analysis of copyright renewal rates, see Barbara A. Ringer, Study 
No. 31: Renewal of Copyright, Studies on Copyright, vol. 1 (New York: 
Practicing Law Institute, 1963), 618. For a more recent and comprehensive 
analysis, see William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner, Indefinitely Renewable 
Copyright, University of Chicago Law Review 70 (2003): 471, 498-501, and 
accompanying figures.
11. See Ringer, ch. 9, n. 2.
12. These statistics are understated. Between the years 1910 and 1962 (the first 
year the renewal term was extended), the average term was never more than 
thirty-two years, and averaged thirty years. See Landes and Posner, 
Indefinitely Renewable Copyright, loc. cit.

15. Professor Rubenfeld has presented a powerful constitutional argument about 
the difference that copyright law should draw (from the perspective of the First 
Amendment) between mere copies and derivative works. See Jed Rubenfeld, The 
Freedom of Imagination: Copyright’s Constitutionality, Yale Law Journal 112 
(2002): 1-60 (see especially pp. 53-59).
16. This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one. The law certainly 
regulates more than copiesa public performance of a copyrighted song, for 
example, is regulated even though performance per se doesn’t make a copy; 17 
/United States Code, section 106(4). And it certainly sometimes doesn’t 
regulate a copy; 17 United States Code, section 112(a). But the presumption 
under the existing law (which regulates copies; 17 United States Code, 
section 102) is that if there is a copy, there is a right.
17. Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright law extends, we 
should repeal it. It is instead that we should have a good argument for its 
extending where it does, and should not determine its reach on the basis of 
arbitrary and automatic changes caused by technology.
18. I don’t mean nature in the sense that it couldn’t be different, but rather 
that its present instantiation entails a copy. Optical networks need not make 
copies of content they transmit, and a digital network could be designed to 
delete anything it copies so that the same number of copies remain.

21. In principle, a contract might impose a requirement on me. I might, for 
example, buy a book from you that includes a contract that says I will read it 
only three times, or that I promise to read it three times. But that obligation 
(and the limits for creating that obligation) would come from the contract, not 
from copyright law, and the obligations of contract would not necessarily pass 
to anyone who subsequently acquired the book.

These restrictions are, of course, not limited to drug policy. See, for example, 
Nat Ives, On the Issue of an Iraq War, Advocacy Ads Meet with Rejection from TV 
Networks, New York Times, 13 March 2003, C4. Outside of election-related air 
time there is very little that the FCC or the courts are willing to do to even 
the playing field. For a general overview, see Rhonda Brown, Ad Hoc Access: The 
Regulation of Editorial Advertising on Television and Radio, Yale Law and 
Policy Review 6 (1988): 449-79, and for a more recent summary of the stance of 
the FCC and the courts, see Radio-Television News Directors Association v. 
/FCC, 184 F. 3d 872 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Municipal authorities exercise the same 
authority as the networks. In a recent example from San Francisco, the San 
Francisco transit authority rejected an ad that criticized its Muni diesel 
buses. Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross, Antidiesel Group Fuming After Muni 
Rejects Ad, SFGate.com, 16 June 2003, available at link #32. The ground was

Reps. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Howard L. Berman (D-Calif.) have introduced 
a bill that would treat unauthorized on-line copying as a felony offense with 
punishments ranging as high as five years imprisonment; see Jon Healey, House 
Bill Aims to Up Stakes on Piracy, Los Angeles Times, 17 July 2003, available 
at link #34. Civil penalties are currently set at $150,000 per copied song. For 
a recent (and unsuccessful) legal challenge to the RIAA’s demand that an ISP 
reveal the identity of a user accused of sharing more than 600 songs through a 
family computer, see RIAA v. Verizon Internet Services (In re. Verizon 
Internet Services), 240 F. Supp. 2d 24 (D.D.C. 2003). Such a user could face 
liability ranging as high as $90 million. Such astronomical figures furnish the 
RIAA with a powerful arsenal in its prosecution of file sharers. Settlements 
ranging from $12,000 to $17,500 for four students accused of heavy file sharing 
on university networks must have seemed a mere pittance next to the $98 billion 
the RIAA could seek should the matter proceed to court. See Elizabeth Young, 
Downloading Could Lead to Fines, redandblack.com, 26 August 2003, available at

10. The only circuit court exception is found in Recording Industry Association 
of America (RIAA) v. Diamond Multimedia Systems, 180 F. 3d 1072 (9th Cir. 
1999). There the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit reasoned that makers of 
a portable MP3 player were not liable for contributory copyright infringement 
for a device that is unable to record or redistribute music (a device whose only 
copying function is to render portable a music file already stored on a user’s 
hard drive).
At the district court level, the only exception is found in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029 (C.D. Cal., 2003), 
where the court found the link between the distributor and any given user’s 
conduct too attenuated to make the distributor liable for contributory or 
vicarious infringement liability.
11. For example, in July 2002, Representative Howard Berman introduced the Peer-
to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act (H.R. 5211), which would immunize copyright 
holders from liability for damage done to computers when the copyright holders 
use technology to stop copyright infringement. In August 2002, Representative 
Billy Tauzin introduced a bill to mandate that technologies capable of 
rebroadcasting digital copies of films broadcast on TV (i.e., computers) respect 
a broadcast flag that would disable copying of that content. And in March of 
the same year, Senator Fritz Hollings introduced the Consumer Broadband and 
Digital Television Promotion Act, which mandated copyright protection technology 
in all digital media devices. See GartnerG2, Copyright and Digital Media in a

1. There’s a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard to describe, but 
it’s a strong one. One phenomenon that the Internet created was a world of 
noncommercial pornographerspeople who were distributing porn but were not 
making money directly or indirectly from that distribution. Such a class didn’t 
exist before the Internet came into being because the costs of distributing porn 
were so high. Yet this new class of distributors got special attention in the 
Supreme Court, when the Court struck down the Communications Decency Act of 
1996. It was partly because of the burden on noncommercial speakers that the 
statute was found to exceed Congress’s power. The same point could have been 
made about noncommercial publishers after the advent of the Internet. The Eric 
Eldreds of the world before the Internet were extremely few. Yet one would think 
it at least as important to protect the Eldreds of the world as to protect 
noncommercial pornographers.

one enumerated power to another. The animating point in the context of the 
Commerce Clause was that the interpretation offered by the government would 
allow the government unending power to regulate commercethe limitation to 
interstate commerce notwithstanding. The same point is true in the context of 
the Copyright Clause. Here, too, the government’s interpretation would allow the 
government unending power to regulate copyrightsthe limitation to limited 
times” notwithstanding.

1. Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national copyright 
legislation sometimes made protection depend upon compliance with formalities 
such as registration, deposit, and affixation of notice of the author’s claim of 
copyright. However, starting with the 1908 act, every text of the Convention has 
provided that the enjoyment and the exercise of rights guaranteed by the 
Convention shall not be subject to any formality. The prohibition against 
formalities is presently embodied in Article 5(2) of the Paris Text of the Berne 
Convention. Many countries continue to impose some form of deposit or 
registration requirement, albeit not as a condition of copyright. French law, 
for example, requires the deposit of copies of works in national repositories, 
principally the National Museum. Copies of books published in the United Kingdom 
must be deposited in the British Library. The German Copyright Act provides for 
a Registrar of Authors where the author’s true name can be filed in the case of 
anonymous or pseudonymous works. Paul Goldstein, International Intellectual

8. Microsoft’s position about free and open source software is more 
sophisticated. As it has repeatedly asserted, it has no problem with open 
source software or software in the public domain. Microsoft’s principal 
opposition is to free software licensed under a copyleft” license, meaning a 
license that requires the licensee to adopt the same terms on any derivative 
work. See Bradford L. Smith, The Future of Software: Enabling the Marketplace 
to Decide, Government Policy Toward Open Source Software (Washington, D.C.:

1. The proposal I am advancing here would apply to American works only. 
Obviously, I believe it would be beneficial for the same idea to be adopted by 
other countries as well.
2. There would be a complication with derivative works that I have not solved 
here. In my view, the law of derivatives creates a more complicated system than 
is justified by the marginal incentive it creates.

Netanel has proposed a related idea that would exempt noncommercial sharing from 
the reach of copyright and would establish compensation to artists to balance 
any loss. See Neil Weinstock Netanel, Impose a Noncommercial Use Levy to Allow 
Free P2P File Sharing, available at link #79. For other proposals, see Lawrence

Fisher’s proposal is very similar to Richard Stallman’s proposal for DAT. Unlike 
Fisher’s, Stallman’s proposal would not pay artists directly proportionally, 
though more popular artists would get more than the less popular. As is typical 
with Stallman, his proposal predates the current debate by about a decade. See 
link #85.

11. A good example is the work of Professor Stan Liebowitz. Liebowitz is to be 
commended for his careful review of data about infringement, leading him to 
question his own publicly stated positiontwice. He initially predicted that 
downloading would substantially harm the industry. He then revised his view in 
light of the data, and he has since revised his view again. Compare Stan J. 
Liebowitz, Rethinking the Network Economy: The True Forces That Drive the 
Digital Marketplace (New York: Amacom, 2002), 173 (reviewing his original view 
but expressing skepticism) with Stan J. Liebowitz, Will MP3s Annihilate the 
Record Industry? working paper, June 2003, available at link #86.
Liebowitz’s careful analysis is extremely valuable in estimating the effect of 
file-sharing technology. In my view, however, he underestimates the costs of the 
legal system. See, for example, Rethinking, 174-76.
