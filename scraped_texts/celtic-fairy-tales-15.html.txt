Shortly after the birth of Kilhuch, the son of King Kilyth, his
mother died. Before her death she charged the king that he should
not take a wife again until he saw a briar with two blossoms upon
her grave, and the king sent every morning to see if anything were
growing thereon. After many years the briar appeared, and he took to
wife the widow of King Doged. She foretold to her stepson, Kilhuch,
that it was his destiny to marry a maiden named Olwen, or none
other, and he, at his father’s bidding, went to the court of his
cousin, King Arthur, to ask as a boon the hand of the maiden. He
rode upon a grey steed with shell-formed hoofs, having a bridle of
linked gold, and a saddle also of gold. In his hand were two spears
of silver, well-tempered, headed with steel, of an edge to wound the
wind and cause blood to flow, and swifter than the fall of the dew-
drop from the blade of reed grass upon the earth when the dew of
June is at its heaviest. A gold-hilted sword was on his thigh, and
the blade was of gold, having inlaid upon it a cross of the hue of
the lightning of heaven. Two brindled, white-breasted greyhounds,
with strong collars of rubies, sported round him, and his courser
cast up four sods with its four hoofs like four swallows about his
head. Upon the steed was a four-cornered cloth of purple, and an
apple of gold was at each corner. Precious gold was upon the
stirrups and shoes, and the blade of grass bent not beneath them, so
light was the courser’s tread as he went towards the gate of King
Arthur’s palace.
Arthur received him with great ceremony, and asked him to remain at
the palace; but the youth replied that he came not to consume meat
and drink, but to ask a boon of the king.
Then said Arthur, “Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou
shalt receive the boon, whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as
the wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the
sea encircles, and the earth extends, save only my ships and my
mantle, my sword, my lance, my shield, my dagger, and Guinevere my
wife.”
So Kilhuch craved of him the hand of Olwen, the daughter of
Yspathaden Penkawr, and also asked the favour and aid of all
Arthur’s court.
Then said Arthur, “O chieftain, I have never heard of the maiden of
whom thou speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will gladly send
messengers in search of her.”
And the youth said, “I will willingly grant from this night to that
at the end of the year to do so.”
Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to
seek for the maiden; and at the end of the year Arthur’s messengers
returned without having gained any knowledge or information
concerning Olwen more than on the first day.
Then said Kilhuch, “Every one has received his boon, and I yet lack
mine. I will depart and bear away thy honour with me.”
Then said Kay, “Rash chieftain! dost thou reproach Arthur? Go with
us, and we will not part until thou dost either confess that the
maiden exists not in the world, or until we obtain her.”
Thereupon Kay rose up.
Kay had this peculiarity, that his breath lasted nine nights and
nine days under water, and he could exist nine nights and nine days
without sleep. A wound from Kay’s sword no physician could heal.
Very subtle was Kay. When it pleased him he could render himself as
tall as the highest tree in the forest. And he had another
peculiarity–so great was the heat of his nature, that, when it
rained hardest, whatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth
above and a handbreadth below his hand; and when his companions were
coldest, it was to them as fuel with which to light their fire.
And Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise upon
which Kay was bound. None was equal to him in swiftness throughout
this island except Arthur and Drych Ail Kibthar. And although he was
one-handed, three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on
the field of battle. Another property he had; his lance would
produce a wound equal to those of nine opposing lances.
And Arthur called to Kynthelig the guide. “Go thou upon this
expedition with the Chieftain.” For as good a guide was he in a land
which he had never seen as he was in his own.
He called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, because he knew all tongues.
He called Gwalchmai, the son of Gwyar, because he never returned
home without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest. He
was the best of footmen and the best of knights. He was nephew to
Arthur, the son of his sister, and his cousin.
And Arthur called Menw, the son of Teirgwaeth, in order that if they
went into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an illusion
over them, so that none might see them whilst they could see every
one.
They journeyed on till they came to a vast open plain, wherein they
saw a great castle, which was the fairest in the world. But so far
away was it that at night it seemed no nearer, and they scarcely
reached it on the third day. When they came before the castle they
beheld a vast flock of sheep, boundless and without end. They told
their errand to the herdsman, who endeavoured to dissuade them,
since none who had come thither on that quest had returned alive.
They gave to him a gold ring, which he conveyed to his wife, telling
her who the visitors were.
On the approach of the latter, she ran out with joy to greet them,
and sought to throw her arms about their necks. But Kay, snatching a
billet out of the pile, placed the log between her two hands, and
she squeezed it so that it became a twisted coil.
“O woman,” said Kay, “if thou hadst squeezed me thus, none could
ever again have set their affections on me. Evil love were this.”
They entered the house, and after meat she told them that the maiden
Olwen came there every Saturday to wash. They pledged their faith
that they would not harm her, and a message was sent to her. So
Olwen came, clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and with a
collar of ruddy gold, in which were emeralds and rubies, about her
neck. More golden was her hair than the flower of the broom, and her
skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands
and her fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the
spray of the meadow fountain. Brighter were her glances than those
of a falcon; her bosom was more snowy than the breast of the white
swan, her cheek redder than the reddest roses. Whoso beheld was
filled with her love. Four white trefoils sprang up wherever she
trod, and therefore was she called Olwen.
Then Kilhuch, sitting beside her on a bench, told her his love, and
she said that he would win her as his bride if he granted whatever
her father asked.
Accordingly they went up to the castle and laid their request before
him.
“Raise up the forks beneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over
my eyes,” said Yspathaden Penkawr, “that I may see the fashion of my
son-in-law.”
They did so, and he promised, them an answer on the morrow. But as
they were going forth, Yspathaden seized one of the three poisoned
darts that lay beside him and threw it back after them.
And Bedwyr caught it and flung it back, wounding Yspathaden in the
knee.
Then said he, “A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly. I shall ever
walk the worse for his rudeness. This poisoned iron pains me like
the bite of a gad-fly. Cursed be the smith who forged it, and the
anvil whereon it was wrought.”
The knights rested in the house of Custennin the herdsman, but the
next day at dawn they returned to the castle and renewed their
request.
Yspathaden said it was necessary that he should consult Olwen’s four
great-grandmothers and her four great-grand-sires.
The knights again withdrew, and as they were going he took the
second dart and cast it after them.
But Menw caught it and flung it back, piercing Yspathaden’s breast
with it, so that it came out at the small of his back.
“A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly,” says he, “the hard iron pains
me like the bite of a horse-leech. Cursed be the hearth whereon it
was heated! Henceforth whenever I go up a hill, I shall have a scant
in my breath and a pain in my chest.”
On the third day the knights returned once more to the palace, and
Yspathaden took the third dart and cast it at them.
But Kilhuch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him
through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his
head.
“A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly. As long as I remain alive my
eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind my eyes
will water, and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a
giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged.
Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.”
And they went to meat.
Said Yspathaden Penkawr, “Is it thou that seekest my daughter?”
“It is I,” answered Kilhuch.
“I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not do towards me otherwise
than is just, and when I have gotten that which I shall name, my
daughter thou shalt have.”
“I promise thee that willingly,” said Kilhuch, “name what thou
wilt.”
“I will do so,” said he.
“Throughout the world there is not a comb or scissors with which I
can arrange my hair, on, account of its rankness, except the comb
and scissors that are between the two ears of Turch Truith, the son
of Prince Tared. He will not give them of his own free will, and
thou wilt not be able to compel him.”
“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think
that it will not be easy.”
“Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get. It
will not be possible to hunt Turch Truith without Drudwyn the whelp
of Greid, the son of Eri, and know that throughout the world there
is not a huntsman who can hunt with this dog, except Mabon the son
of Modron. He was taken from his mother when three nights old, and
it is not known where he now is, nor whether he is living or dead.”
“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think
that it will not be easy.”
“Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get.
Thou wilt not get Mabon, for it is not known where he is, unless
thou find Eidoel, his kinsman in blood, the son of Aer. For it would
be useless to seek for him. He is his cousin.”
“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think
that it will not be easy. Horses shall I have, and chivalry; and my
lord and kinsman Arthur will obtain for me all these things. And I
shall gain thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.”
“Go forward. And thou shalt not be chargeable for food or raiment
for my daughter while thou art seeking these things; and when thou
hast compassed all these marvels, thou shalt have my daughter for
wife.”
Now, when they told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said, “Which of
these marvels will it be best for us to seek first?”
“It will be best,” said they, “to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and
he will not be found unless we first find Eidoel, the son of Aer,
his kinsman.”
Then Arthur rose up, and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with
him, to seek for Eidoel; and they proceeded until they came before
the castle of Glivi, where Eidoel was imprisoned.
Glivi stood on the summit of his castle, and said, “Arthur, what
requirest thou of me, since nothing remains to me in this fortress,
and I have neither joy nor pleasure in it; neither wheat nor oats?”
Said Arthur, “Not to injure thee came I hither, but to seek for the
prisoner that is with thee.”
“I will give thee my prisoner, though I had not thought to give him
up to any one; and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid.”
His followers then said unto Arthur, “Lord, go thou home, thou canst
not proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as
these.”
Then said Arthur, “It were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawt
Ieithoedd, to go upon this quest, for thou knowest all languages,
and art familiar with those of the birds and the beasts. Go, Eidoel,
likewise with my men in search of thy cousin. And as for you, Kay
and Bedwyr, I have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of,
that ye will achieve it. Achieve ye this adventure for me.”
These went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri, and
Gwrhyr adjured her for the sake of Heaven, saying, “Tell me if thou
knowest aught of Mabon, the son of Modron, who was taken when three
nights old from between his mother and the wall.”
And the Ousel answered, “When I first came here there was a smith’s
anvil in this place, and I was then a young bird, and from that time
no work has been done upon it, save the pecking of my beak every
evening, and now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining
thereof; yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me if during all that
time I have ever heard of the man for whom you inquire.
Nevertheless, there is a race of animals who were formed before me,
and I will be your guide to them.”
So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre.
“Stag of Redynvre, behold we are come to thee, an embassy from
Arthur, for we have not heard of any animal older than thou. Say,
knowest thou aught of Mabon?”
The stag said, “When first I came hither there was a plain all
around me, without any trees save one oak sapling, which grew up to
be an oak with an hundred branches. And that oak has since perished,
so that now nothing remains of it but the withered stump; and from
that day to this I have been here, yet have I never heard of the man
for whom you inquire. Nevertheless, I will be your guide to the
place where there is an animal which was formed before I was.”
So they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd, to
inquire of him concerning Mabon.
And the owl said, “If I knew I would tell you. When first I came
hither, the wide valley you see was a wooded glen. And a race of men
came and rooted it up. And there grew there a second wood, and this
wood is the third. My wings, are they not withered stumps? Yet all
this time, even until to-day, I have never heard of the man for whom
you inquire. Nevertheless, I will be the guide of Arthur’s embassy
until you come to the place where is the oldest animal in this
world, and the one who has travelled most, the eagle of Gwern Abwy.”
When they came to the eagle, Gwrhyr asked it the same question; but
it replied, “I have been here for a great space of time, and when I
first came hither there was a rock here, from the top of which I
pecked at the stars every evening, and now it is not so much as a
span high. From that day to this I have been here, and I have never
heard of the man for whom you inquire, except once when I went in
search of food as far as Llyn Llyw.  And when I came there, I struck
my talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve me as food for a
long time. But he drew me into the deep, and I was scarcely able to
escape from him. After that I went with my whole kindred to attack
him and to try to destroy him, but he sent messengers and made peace
with me, and came and besought me to take fifty fish-spears out of
his back. Unless he know something of him whom you seek, I cannot
tell you who may. However, I will guide you to the place where he
is.”
So they went thither, and the eagle said, “Salmon of Llyn Llyw, I
have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to ask thee if thou
knowest aught concerning Mabon, the son of Modron, who was taken
away at three nights old from between his mother and the wall.”
And the salmon answered, “As much as I know I will tell thee. With
every tide I go along the river upwards, until I come near to the
walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never
found elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give credence thereto,
let one of you go thither upon each of my two shoulders.”
So Kay and Gwrhyr went upon his shoulders, and they proceeded till
they came to the wall of the prison, and they heard a great wailing
and lamenting from the dungeon. Said Gwrhyr, “Who is it that laments
in this house of stone?”
And the voice replied, “Alas, it is Mabon, the son of Modron, who is
here imprisoned!”
Then they returned and told Arthur, who, summoning his warriors,
attacked the castle.
And whilst the fight was going on, Kay and Bedwyr, mounting on the
shoulders of the fish, broke into the dungeon, and brought away with
them Mabon, the son of Modron.
Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the
three islands of Britain and in the three islands adjacent; and he
went as far as Esgeir Ocrvel in Ireland where the Boar Truith was
with his seven young pigs. And the dogs were let loose upon him from
all sides. But he wasted the fifth part of Ireland, and then set
forth through the sea to Wales. Arthur and his hosts, and his
horses, and his dogs followed hard after him. But ever and awhile
the boar made a stand, and many a champion of Arthur’s did he slay.
Throughout all Wales did Arthur follow him, and one by one the
young pigs were killed. At length, when he would fain have crossed
the Severn and escaped into Cornwall, Mabon the son of Modron came
up with him, and Arthur fell upon him together with the champions of
Britain. On the one side Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed
and snatched his razor from him, whilst Kay came up with him on the
other side and took from him the scissors. But before they could
obtain the comb he had regained the ground with his feet, and from
the moment that he reached the shore, neither dog nor man nor horse
could overtake him until he came to Cornwall. There Arthur and his
hosts followed in his track until they overtook him in Cornwall.
Hard had been their trouble before, but it was child’s play to what
they met in seeking the comb. Win it they did, and the Boar Truith
they hunted into the deep sea, and it was never known whither he
went.
Then Kilhuch set forward, and as many as wished ill to Yspathaden
Penkawr. And they took the marvels with them to his court. And Kaw
of North Britain came and shaved his beard, skin and flesh clean off
to the very bone from ear to ear.
“Art thou shaved, man?” said Kilhuch.
“I am shaved,” answered he.
“Is thy daughter mine now?”
“She is thine, but therefore needst thou not thank me, but Arthur
who hath accomplished this for thee. By my free will thou shouldst
never have had her, for with her I lose my life.”
Then Goreu the son of Custennin seized him by the hair of his head
and dragged him after him to the keep, and cut off his head and
placed it on a stake on the citadel.
Thereafter the hosts of Arthur dispersed themselves each man to his
own country.
Thus did Kilhuch son of Kelython win to wife Olwen, the daughter of
Yspathaden Penkawr.
