Remind thyself that he whom thou lovest is mortal—that what
thou lovest is not thine own; it is given thee for the present,
not irrevocably nor for ever, but even as a fig or a bunch of
grapes at the appointed season of the year. . . .
“But these are words of evil omen.”. . .
What, callest thou aught of evil omen save that which
signifies some evil thing? Cowardice is a word of evil omen, if
thou wilt, and meanness of spirit, and lamentation and mourning
and shamelessness. . . .
But do not, I pray thee, call of evil omen a word that is
significant of any natural thing:—as well call of evil omen the
reaping of the corn; for it means the destruction of the ears,
though not of the World!—as well say that the fall of the leaf
is of evil omen; that the dried fig should take the place of the
green; that raisins should be made from grapes. All these are
changes from a former state into another; not destruction, but an
ordered economy, a fixed administration. Such is leaving home, a
change of small account; such is Death, a greater change, from
what now is, not to what is not, but to what is not now.
“Shall I then no longer be?”
Not so; thou wilt be; but something different, of which the
World now hath need. For thou too wert born not when thou
chosest, but when the World had need of thee.
