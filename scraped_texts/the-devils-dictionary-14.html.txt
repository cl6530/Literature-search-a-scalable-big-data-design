MACE, n.  A staff of office signifying authority.  Its form, that of a 
heavy club, indicates its original purpose and use in dissuading from 
dissent.
MACHINATION, n.  The method employed by one’s opponents in baffling 
one’s open and honorable efforts to do the right thing.
  So plain the advantages of machination
  It constitutes a moral obligation,
  And honest wolves who think upon’t with loathing
  Feel bound to don the sheep’s deceptive clothing.
  So prospers still the diplomatic art,
  And Satan bows, with hand upon his heart.

MACROBIAN, n.  One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age.  
History is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old 
Parr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known.  A 
Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he 
had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace.  
Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he 
could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging.  In 1566 a 
linen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five 
hundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie.  
There are instances of longevity (macrobiosis) in our own country.  
Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better.  The editor of 
The American, a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes 
back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact.  The 
President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the 
friends of his youth have risen to high political and military 
preferment without the assistance of personal merit.  The verses 
following were written by a macrobian:
  When I was young the world was fair
      And amiable and sunny.
  A brightness was in all the air,
      In all the waters, honey.
      The jokes were fine and funny,
  The statesmen honest in their views,
      And in their lives, as well,
  And when you heard a bit of news
      ’Twas true enough to tell.
  Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking,
  Nor women “generally speaking.”
  The Summer then was long indeed:
      It lasted one whole season!
  The sparkling Winter gave no heed
      When ordered by Unreason
      To bring the early peas on.
  Now, where the dickens is the sense
      In calling that a year
  Which does no more than just commence
      Before the end is near?
  When I was young the year extended
  From month to month until it ended.
  I know not why the world has changed
      To something dark and dreary,
  And everything is now arranged
      To make a fellow weary.
      The Weather Man — I fear he
  Has much to do with it, for, sure,
      The air is not the same:
  It chokes you when it is impure,
      When pure it makes you lame.
  With windows closed you are asthmatic;
  Open, neuralgic or sciatic.
  Well, I suppose this new regime
      Of dun degeneration
  Seems eviler than it would seem
      To a better observation,
      And has for compensation
  Some blessings in a deep disguise
      Which mortal sight has failed
  To pierce, although to angels’ eyes
      They’re visible unveiled.
  If Age is such a boon, good land!
  He’s costumed by a master hand!
Venable Strigg

MAD, adj.  Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; 
not conforming to standards of thought, speech and action derived by 
the conformants from study of themselves; at odds with the majority; 
in short, unusual.  It is noteworthy that persons are pronounced mad 
by officials destitute of evidence that themselves are sane.  For 
illustration, this present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no 
firmer in the faith of his own sanity than is any inmate of any 
madhouse in the land; yet for aught he knows to the contrary, instead 
of the lofty occupation that seems to him to be engaging his powers he 
may really be beating his hands against the window bars of an asylum 
and declaring himself Noah Webster, to the innocent delight of many 
thoughtless spectators.
MAGDALENE, n.  An inhabitant of Magdala.  Popularly, a woman found 
out.  This definition of the word has the authority of ignorance, Mary 
of Magdala being another person than the penitent woman mentioned by 
St. Luke.  It has also the official sanction of the governments of 
Great Britain and the United States.  In England the word is 
pronounced Maudlin, whence maudlin, adjective, unpleasantly 
sentimental.  With their Maudlin for Magdalene, and their Bedlam for 
Bethlehem, the English may justly boast themselves the greatest of 
revisers.
MAGIC, n.  An art of converting superstition into coin.  There are 
other arts serving the same high purpose, but the discreet 
lexicographer does not name them.
MAGNET, n.  Something acted upon by magnetism.
MAGNETISM, n.  Something acting upon a magnet.
  The two definitions immediately foregoing are condensed from the 
works of one thousand eminent scientists, who have illuminated the 
subject with a great white light, to the inexpressible advancement of 
human knowledge.
MAGNIFICENT, adj.  Having a grandeur or splendor superior to that to 
which the spectator is accustomed, as the ears of an ass, to a rabbit, 
or the glory of a glowworm, to a maggot.
MAGNITUDE, n.  Size.  Magnitude being purely relative, nothing is 
large and nothing small.  If everything in the universe were increased 
in bulk one thousand diameters nothing would be any larger than it was 
before, but if one thing remain unchanged all the others would be 
larger than they had been.  To an understanding familiar with the 
relativity of magnitude and distance the spaces and masses of the 
astronomer would be no more impressive than those of the microscopist.  
For anything we know to the contrary, the visible universe may be a 
small part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life- 
fluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal.  Possibly the wee creatures 
peopling the corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper 
emotion when contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these 
to another.
MAGPIE, n.  A bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone 
that it might be taught to talk.
MAIDEN, n.  A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless 
conduct and views that madden to crime.  The genus has a wide 
geographical distribution, being found wherever sought and deplored 
wherever found.  The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye, 
nor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear, though 
in respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with 
regard to the part of her that is audible, bleating out of the field 
by the canary — which, also, is more portable.
  A lovelorn maiden she sat and sang —
      This quaint, sweet song sang she;
  “It’s O for a youth with a football bang
      And a muscle fair to see!
              The Captain he
              Of a team to be!
  On the gridiron he shall shine,
  A monarch by right divine,
      And never to roast on it — me!”
Opoline Jones

MAJESTY, n.  The state and title of a king.  Regarded with a just 
contempt by the Most Eminent Grand Masters, Grand Chancellors, Great 
Incohonees and Imperial Potentates of the ancient and honorable orders 
of republican America.
MALE, n.  A member of the unconsidered, or negligible sex.  The male 
of the human race is commonly known (to the female) as Mere Man.  The 
genus has two varieties:  good providers and bad providers.
MALEFACTOR, n.  The chief factor in the progress of the human race.
MALTHUSIAN, adj.  Pertaining to Malthus and his doctrines.  Malthus 
believed in artificially limiting population, but found that it could 
not be done by talking.  One of the most practical exponents of the 
Malthusian idea was Herod of Judea, though all the famous soldiers 
have been of the same way of thinking.
MAMMALIA, n.pl.  A family of vertebrate animals whose females in a 
state of nature suckle their young, but when civilized and enlightened 
put them out to nurse, or use the bottle.
MAMMON, n.  The god of the world’s leading religion.  The chief temple 
is in the holy city of New York.
  He swore that all other religions were gammon,
  And wore out his knees in the worship of Mammon.
Jared Oopf

MAN, n.  An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he 
thinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be.  His 
chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own 
species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to 
infest the whole habitable earh and Canada.
  When the world was young and Man was new,
      And everything was pleasant,
  Distinctions Nature never drew
      ’Mongst kings and priest and peasant.
      We’re not that way at present,
  Save here in this Republic, where
      We have that old regime,
  For all are kings, however bare
      Their backs, howe’er extreme
  Their hunger.  And, indeed, each has a voice
  To accept the tyrant of his party’s choice.
  A citizen who would not vote,
      And, therefore, was detested,
  Was one day with a tarry coat
      (With feathers backed and breasted)
      By patriots invested.
  “It is your duty,” cried the crowd,
      “Your ballot true to cast
  For the man o’ your choice.”  He humbly bowed,
      And explained his wicked past:
  “That’s what I very gladly would have done,
  Dear patriots, but he has never run.”
Apperton Duke

MANES, n.  The immortal parts of dead Greeks and Romans.  They were in 
a state of dull discomfort until the bodies from which they had 
exhaled were buried and burned; and they seem not to have been 
particularly happy afterward.
MANICHEISM, n.  The ancient Persian doctrine of an incessant warfare 
between Good and Evil.  When Good gave up the fight the Persians 
joined the victorious Opposition.
MANNA, n.  A food miraculously given to the Israelites in the 
wilderness.  When it was no longer supplied to them they settled 
down and tilled the soil, fertilizing it, as a rule, with the bodies 
of the original occupants.
MARRIAGE, n.  The state or condition of a community consisting of a 
master, a mistress and two slaves, making in all, two.
MARTYR, n.  One who moves along the line of least reluctance to a 
desired death.
MATERIAL, adj.  Having an actual existence, as distinguished from an 
imaginary one.  Important.
  Material things I know, or fell, or see;
  All else is immaterial to me.
Jamrach Holobom

MAUSOLEUM, n.  The final and funniest folly of the rich.
MAYONNAISE, n.  One of the sauces which serve the French in place of a 
state religion.
ME, pro.  The objectionable case of I.  The personal pronoun in 
English has three cases, the dominative, the objectionable and the 
oppressive.  Each is all three.
MEANDER, n.  To proceed sinuously and aimlessly.  The word is the 
ancient name of a river about one hundred and fifty miles south of 
Troy, which turned and twisted in the effort to get out of hearing 
when the Greeks and Trojans boasted of their prowess.
MEDAL, n.  A small metal disk given as a reward for virtues, 
attainments or services more or less authentic.
  It is related of Bismark, who had been awarded a medal for 
gallantly rescuing a drowning person, that, being asked the meaning of 
the medal, he replied:  “I save lives sometimes.”  And sometimes he 
didn’t.
MEDICINE, n.  A stone flung down the Bowery to kill a dog in Broadway.
MEEKNESS, n.  Uncommon patience in planning a revenge that is worth 
while.
  M is for Moses,
      Who slew the Egyptian.
  As sweet as a rose is
  The meekness of Moses.
  No monument shows his
      Post-mortem inscription,
  But M is for Moses
      Who slew the Egyptian.
The Biographical Alphabet
MEERSCHAUM, n.  (Literally, seafoam, and by many erroneously supposed 
to be made of it.)  A fine white clay, which for convenience in 
coloring it brown is made into tobacco pipes and smoked by the workmen 
engaged in that industry.  The purpose of coloring it has not been 
disclosed by the manufacturers.
  There was a youth (you’ve heard before,
      This woeful tale, may be),
  Who bought a meerschaum pipe and swore
      That color it would he!
  He shut himself from the world away,
      Nor any soul he saw.
  He smoke by night, he smoked by day,
      As hard as he could draw.
  His dog died moaning in the wrath
      Of winds that blew aloof;
  The weeds were in the gravel path,
      The owl was on the roof.
  “He’s gone afar, he’ll come no more,"
      The neighbors sadly say.
  And so they batter in the door
      To take his goods away.
  Dead, pipe in mouth, the youngster lay,
      Nut-brown in face and limb.
  “That pipe’s a lovely white,” they say,
      “But it has colored him!”
  The moral there’s small need to sing —
      ’Tis plain as day to you:
  Don’t play your game on any thing
      That is a gamester too.
Martin Bulstrode

MENDACIOUS, adj.  Addicted to rhetoric.
MERCHANT, n.  One engaged in a commercial pursuit.  A commercial 
pursuit is one in which the thing pursued is a dollar.
MERCY, n.  An attribute beloved of detected offenders.
MESMERISM, n.  Hypnotism before it wore good clothes, kept a carriage 
and asked Incredulity to dinner.
METROPOLIS, n.  A stronghold of provincialism.
MILLENNIUM, n.  The period of a thousand years when the lid is to be 
screwed down, with all reformers on the under side.
MIND, n.  A mysterious form of matter secreted by the brain.  Its 
chief activity consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, 
the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing 
but itself to know itself with.  From the Latin mens, a fact unknown 
to that honest shoe-seller, who, observing that his learned competitor 
over the way had displayed the motto “Mens conscia recti,” 
emblazoned his own front with the words “Men’s, women’s and children’s 
conscia recti.”
MINE, adj.  Belonging to me if I can hold or seize it.
MINISTER, n.  An agent of a higher power with a lower responsibility.  
In diplomacy and officer sent into a foreign country as the visible 
embodiment of his sovereign’s hostility.  His principal qualification 
is a degree of plausible inveracity next below that of an ambassador.
MINOR, adj.  Less objectionable.
MINSTREL, adj.  Formerly a poet, singer or musician; now a nigger with 
a color less than skin deep and a humor more than flesh and blood can 
bear.
MIRACLE, n.  An act or event out of the order of nature and 
unaccountable, as beating a normal hand of four kings and an ace with 
four aces and a king.
MISCREANT, n.  A person of the highest degree of unworth.  
Etymologically, the word means unbeliever, and its present 
signification may be regarded as theology’s noblest contribution to 
the development of our language.
MISDEMEANOR, n.  An infraction of the law having less dignity than a 
felony and constituting no claim to admittance into the best criminal 
society.
  By misdemeanors he essays to climb
  Into the aristocracy of crime.
  O, woe was him! — with manner chill and grand
  “Captains of industry” refused his hand,
  “Kings of finance” denied him recognition
  And “railway magnates” jeered his low condition.
  He robbed a bank to make himself respected.
  They still rebuffed him, for he was detected.
S.V. Hanipur

MISERICORDE, n.  A dagger which in mediaeval warfare was used by the 
foot soldier to remind an unhorsed knight that he was mortal.
MISFORTUNE, n.  The kind of fortune that never misses.
MISS, n.  The title with which we brand unmarried women to indicate 
that they are in the market.  Miss, Missis (Mrs.) and Mister (Mr.) are 
the three most distinctly disagreeable words in the language, in sound 
and sense.  Two are corruptions of Mistress, the other of Master.  In 
the general abolition of social titles in this our country they 
miraculously escaped to plague us.  If we must have them let us be 
consistent and give one to the unmarried man.  I venture to suggest 
Mush, abbreviated to Mh.
MOLECULE, n.  The ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  It is 
distinguished from the corpuscle, also the ultimate, indivisible unit 
of matter, by a closer resemblance to the atom, also the ultimate, 
indivisible unit of matter.  Three great scientific theories of the 
structure of the universe are the molecular, the corpuscular and the 
atomic.  A fourth affirms, with Haeckel, the condensation of 
precipitation of matter from ether — whose existence is proved by the 
condensation of precipitation.  The present trend of scientific 
thought is toward the theory of ions.  The ion differs from the 
molecule, the corpuscle and the atom in that it is an ion.  A fifth 
theory is held by idiots, but it is doubtful if they know any more 
about the matter than the others.
MONAD, n.  The ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  (See 
Molecule.)  According to Leibnitz, as nearly as he seems willing to 
be understood, the monad has body without bulk, and mind without 
manifestation — Leibnitz knows him by the innate power of 
considering.  He has founded upon him a theory of the universe, which 
the creature bears without resentment, for the monad is a gentlmean.  
Small as he is, the monad contains all the powers and possibilities 
needful to his evolution into a German philosopher of the first class 
— altogether a very capable little fellow.  He is not to be 
confounded with the microbe, or bacillus; by its inability to discern 
him, a good microscope shows him to be of an entirely distinct 
species.
MONARCH, n.  A person engaged in reigning.  Formerly the monarch 
ruled, as the derivation of the word attests, and as many subjects 
have had occasion to learn.  In Russia and the Orient the monarch has 
still a considerable influence in public affairs and in the 
disposition of the human head, but in western Europe political 
administration is mostly entrusted to his ministers, he being 
somewhat preoccupied with reflections relating to the status of his 
own head.
MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT, n.  Government.
MONDAY, n.  In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.
MONEY, n.  A blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we 
part with it.  An evidence of culture and a passport to polite 
society.  Supportable property.
MONKEY, n.  An arboreal animal which makes itself at home in 
genealogical trees.
MONOSYLLABIC, adj.  Composed of words of one syllable, for literary 
babes who never tire of testifying their delight in the vapid compound 
by appropriate googoogling.  The words are commonly Saxon — that is 
to say, words of a barbarous people destitute of ideas and incapable 
of any but the most elementary sentiments and emotions.
  The man who writes in Saxon
  Is the man to use an ax on
Judibras

MONSIGNOR, n.  A high ecclesiastical title, of which the Founder of 
our religion overlooked the advantages.
MONUMENT, n.  A structure intended to commemorate something which 
either needs no commemoration or cannot be commemorated.
  The bones of Agammemnon are a show,
  And ruined is his royal monument,
but Agammemnon’s fame suffers no diminution in consequence.  The 
monument custom has its reductiones ad absurdum in monuments “to the 
unknown dead” — that is to say, monuments to perpetuate the memory of 
those who have left no memory.
MORAL, adj.  Conforming to a local and mutable standard of right.  
Having the quality of general expediency.
      It is sayd there be a raunge of mountaynes in the Easte, on 
one syde of the which certayn conducts are immorall, yet on the other 
syde they are holden in good esteeme; wherebye the mountayneer is much 
conveenyenced, for it is given to him to goe downe eyther way and act 
as it shall suite his moode, withouten offence.
Gooke’s Meditations

MORE, adj.  The comparative degree of too much.
MOUSE, n.  An animal which strews its path with fainting women.  As in 
Rome Christians were thrown to the lions, so centuries earlier in 
Otumwee, the most ancient and famous city of the world, female 
heretics were thrown to the mice.  Jakak-Zotp, the historian, the only 
Otumwump whose writings have descended to us, says that these martyrs 
met their death with little dignity and much exertion.  He even 
attempts to exculpate the mice (such is the malice of bigotry) by 
declaring that the unfortunate women perished, some from exhaustion, 
some of broken necks from falling over their own feet, and some from 
lack of restoratives.  The mice, he avers, enjoyed the pleasures of 
the chase with composure.  But if “Roman history is nine-tenths 
lying,” we can hardly expect a smaller proportion of that rhetorical 
figure in the annals of a people capable of so incredible cruelty to a 
lovely women; for a hard heart has a false tongue.
MOUSQUETAIRE, n.  A long glove covering a part of the arm.  Worn in 
New Jersey.  But “mousquetaire” is a might poor way to spell 
muskeeter.
MOUTH, n.  In man, the gateway to the soul; in woman, the outlet of 
the heart.
MUGWUMP, n.  In politics one afflicted with self-respect and addicted 
to the vice of independence.  A term of contempt.
MULATTO, n.  A child of two races, ashamed of both.
MULTITUDE, n.  A crowd; the source of political wisdom and virtue.  In 
a republic, the object of the statesman’s adoration.  “In a multitude 
of consellors there is wisdom,” saith the proverb.  If many men of 
equal individual wisdom are wiser than any one of them, it must be 
that they acquire the excess of wisdom by the mere act of getting 
together.  Whence comes it?  Obviously from nowhere — as well say 
that a range of mountains is higher than the single mountains 
composing it.  A multitude is as wise as its wisest member if it obey 
him; if not, it is no wiser than its most foolish.
MUMMY, n.  An ancient Egyptian, formerly in universal use among modern 
civilized nations as medicine, and now engaged in supplying art with 
an excellent pigment.  He is handy, too, in museums in gratifying the 
vulgar curiosity that serves to distinguish man from the lower 
animals.
  By means of the Mummy, mankind, it is said,
  Attests to the gods its respect for the dead.
  We plunder his tomb, be he sinner or saint,
  Distil him for physic and grind him for paint,
  Exhibit for money his poor, shrunken frame,
  And with levity flock to the scene of the shame.
  O, tell me, ye gods, for the use of my rhyme:
  For respecting the dead what’s the limit of time?
Scopas Brune

MUSTANG, n.  An indocile horse of the western plains.  In English 
society, the American wife of an English nobleman.
MYRMIDON, n.  A follower of Achilles — particularly when he didn’t 
lead.
MYTHOLOGY, n.  The body of a primitive people’s beliefs concerning its 
origin, early history, heroes, deities and so forth, as distinguished 
from the true accounts which it invents later.
