X in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility 
to the attacks of the spelling reformers, and like them, will 
doubtless last as long as the language.  X is the sacred symbol of ten 
dollars, and in such words as Xmas, Xn, etc., stands for Christ, not, 
as is popular supposed, because it represents a cross, but because the 
corresponding letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name 
— Xristos.  If it represented a cross it would stand for St.

psychology x stands for Woman’s mind.  Words beginning with X are 
Grecian and will not be defined in this standard English dictionary.
