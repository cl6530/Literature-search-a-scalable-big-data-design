Gentlemen,–I take this opportunity of forwarding to you, the proof
sheets of the unpublished Life of Hans Christian Andersen–
translated from a copy transmitted to me for that purpose, by the
Author. It is as well to state that this is the Author’s Edition, he
being participant in the proceeds of this work.
I remain, gentlemen,
Yours truly,
Mary Howitt.
LONDON, June 29, 1847.
No literary labor is more delightful to me than translating the
beautiful thoughts and fancies of Hans Christian Andersen. My heart is
in the work, and I feel as if my spirit were kindred to his; just as
our Saxon English seems to me eminently fitted to give the simple,
pure, and noble sentiments of the Danish mind.
This True Story of his Life will not be found the least interesting of
his writings; indeed, to me it seems one of the most so. It furnishes
the key, as it were, to all the rest; and the treasures which it
unlocks will be found to be possessed of additional value when viewed
through the medium of this introduction. It is gratifying for me to be
able to state that the original Author has a personal interest in this
English version of his “Life,” as I have arranged with my publishers to
pay Mr. Andersen a certain sum on the publication of this translation,
and the same on all future editions.
