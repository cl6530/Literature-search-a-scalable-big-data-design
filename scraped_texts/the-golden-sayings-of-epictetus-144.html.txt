I am free, I am a friend of God, ready to render Him willing
obedience. Of all else I may set store by nothing—neither by
mine own body, nor possessions, nor office, nor good report, nor,
in a word, aught else beside. For it is not His Will, that I
should so set store by these things. Had it been His pleasure, He
would have placed my Good therein. But now He hath not done so:
therefore I cannot transgress one jot of His commands. In
everything hold fast to that which is thy Good—but to all else
(as far as is given thee) within the measure of Reason only,
contented with this alone. Else thou wilt meet with failure, ill
success, let and hindrance. These are the Laws ordained of God—
these are His Edicts; these a man should expound and interpret;
to these submit himself, not to the laws of Masurius and
Cassius.(16)
