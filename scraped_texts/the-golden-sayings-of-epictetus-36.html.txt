Asked how a man might convince himself that every single act
of his was under the eye of God, Epictetus answered:—
“Do you not hold that all things are bound together in one?”
“I do.”
“Well, and do you not hold that things on earth and things in
heaven are continuous and in unison with each other?”
“I do,” was the reply.
“Else how should the trees so regularly, as though by God’s
command, at His bidding flower; at His bidding send forth shoots,
bear fruit and ripen it; at His bidding let it fall and shed
their leaves, and folded up upon themselves lie in quietness and
rest? How else, as the Moon waxes and wanes, as the Sun
approaches and recedes, can it be that such vicissitude and
alternation is seen in earthly things?
“If then all things that grow, nay, our own bodies, are thus
bound up with the whole, is not this still truer of our souls?

very parts and fragments plucked from Himself, shall He not feel
every movement of theirs as though it were His own, and belonging
to His own nature?”
