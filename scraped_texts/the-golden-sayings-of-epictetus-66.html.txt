Providence directs the Universe; further, that to hide from Him

impossible; secondly, what the nature of God is. Whatever that
nature is discovered to be, the man who would please and obey Him
must strive with all his might to be made like unto Him. If the
Divine is faithful, he also must be faithful; if free, he also
