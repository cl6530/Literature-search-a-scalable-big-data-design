RABBLE, n.  In a republic, those who exercise a supreme authority 
tempered by fraudulent elections.  The rabble is like the sacred 
Simurgh, of Arabian fable — omnipotent on condition that it do 
nothing.  (The word is Aristocratese, and has no exact equivalent in 
our tongue, but means, as nearly as may be, “soaring swine.”)
RACK, n.  An argumentative implement formerly much used in persuading 
devotees of a false faith to embrace the living truth.  As a call to 
the unconverted the rack never had any particular efficacy, and is now 
held in light popular esteem.
RANK, n.  Relative elevation in the scale of human worth.
  He held at court a rank so high
  That other noblemen asked why.
  “Because,” ’twas answered, “others lack
  His skill to scratch the royal back.”
Aramis Jukes

RANSOM, n.  The purchase of that which neither belongs to the seller, 
nor can belong to the buyer.  The most unprofitable of investments.
RAPACITY, n.  Providence without industry.  The thrift of power.
RAREBIT, n.  A Welsh rabbit, in the speech of the humorless, who point 
out that it is not a rabbit.  To whom it may be solemnly explained 
that the comestible known as toad-in-a-hole is really not a toad, and 
that riz-de-veau a la financiere is not the smile of a calf prepared 
after the recipe of a she banker.
RASCAL, n.  A fool considered under another aspect.
RASCALITY, n.  Stupidity militant.  The activity of a clouded 
intellect.
RASH, adj.  Insensible to the value of our advice.
  “Now lay your bet with mine, nor let
      These gamblers take your cash."
  “Nay, this child makes no bet.”  “Great snakes!
      How can you be so rash?”
Bootle P. Gish

RATIONAL, adj.  Devoid of all delusions save those of observation, 
experience and reflection.
RATTLESNAKE, n.  Our prostrate brother, Homo ventrambulans.
RAZOR, n.  An instrument used by the Caucasian to enhance his beauty, 
by the Mongolian to make a guy of himself, and by the Afro-American to 
affirm his worth.
REACH, n.  The radius of action of the human hand.  The area within 
which it is possible (and customary) to gratify directly the 
propensity to provide.
  This is a truth, as old as the hills,
      That life and experience teach:
  The poor man suffers that keenest of ills,
      An impediment of his reach.
G.J.

READING, n.  The general body of what one reads.  In our country it 
consists, as a rule, of Indiana novels, short stories in “dialect” and 
humor in slang.
  We know by one’s reading
  His learning and breeding;
  By what draws his laughter
  We know his Hereafter.
  Read nothing, laugh never —
  The Sphinx was less clever!
Jupiter Muke

RADICALISM, n.  The conservatism of to-morrow injected into the 
affairs of to-day.
RADIUM, n.  A mineral that gives off heat and stimulates the organ 
that a scientist is a fool with.
RAILROAD, n.  The chief of many mechanical devices enabling us to get 
away from where we are to wher we are no better off.  For this purpose 
the railroad is held in highest favor by the optimist, for it permits 
him to make the transit with great expedition.
RAMSHACKLE, adj.  Pertaining to a certain order of architecture, 
otherwise known as the Normal American.  Most of the public buildings 
of the United States are of the Ramshackle order, though some of our 
earlier architects preferred the Ironic.  Recent additions to the 
White House in Washington are Theo-Doric, the ecclesiastic order of 
the Dorians.  They are exceedingly fine and cost one hundred dollars a 
brick.
REALISM, n.  The art of depicting nature as it is seem by toads.  The 
charm suffusing a landscape painted by a mole, or a story written by a 
measuring-worm.
REALITY, n.  The dream of a mad philosopher.  That which would remain 
in the cupel if one should assay a phantom.  The nucleus of a vacuum.
REALLY, adv.  Apparently.
REAR, n.  In American military matters, that exposed part of the army 
that is nearest to Congress.
REASON, v.i.  To weight probabilities in the scales of desire.
REASON, n.  Propensitate of prejudice.

it.
RECOLLECT, v.  To recall with additions something not previously 
known.
RECONCILIATION, n.  A suspension of hostilities.  An armed truce for 
the purpose of digging up the dead.
RECONSIDER, v.  To seek a justification for a decision already made.
RECOUNT, n.  In American politics, another throw of the dice, accorded 
to the player against whom they are loaded.
RECREATION, n.  A particular kind of dejection to relieve a general 
fatigue.
RECRUIT, n.  A person distinguishable from a civilian by his uniform 
and from a soldier by his gait.
  Fresh from the farm or factory or street,
  His marching, in pursuit or in retreat,
      Were an impressive martial spectacle
  Except for two impediments — his feet.
Thompson Johnson

RECTOR, n.  In the Church of England, the Third Person of the 
parochial Trinity, the Cruate and the Vicar being the other two.
REDEMPTION, n.  Deliverance of sinners from the penalty of their sin, 
through their murder of the deity against whom they sinned.  The 
doctrine of Redemption is the fundamental mystery of our holy 
religion, and whoso believeth in it shall not perish, but have 
everlasting life in which to try to understand it.
  We must awake Man’s spirit from his sin,
      And take some special measure for redeeming it;
  Though hard indeed the task to get it in
      Among the angels any way but teaming it,
      Or purify it otherwise than steaming it.
  I’m awkward at Redemption — a beginner:
  My method is to crucify the sinner.
Golgo Brone

REDRESS, n.  Reparation without satisfaction.
  Among the Anglo-Saxon a subject conceiving himself wronged by the 
king was permitted, on proving his injury, to beat a brazen image of 
the royal offender with a switch that was afterward applied to his own 
naked back.  The latter rite was performed by the public hangman, and 
it assured moderation in the plaintiff’s choice of a switch.
RED-SKIN, n.  A North American Indian, whose skin is not red — at 
least not on the outside.
REDUNDANT, adj.  Superfluous; needless; de trop.
  The Sultan said:  “There’s evidence abundant
  To prove this unbelieving dog redundant."
  To whom the Grand Vizier, with mien impressive,
  Replied:  “His head, at least, appears excessive.”
Habeeb Suleiman

  Mr. Debs is a redundant citizen.
Theodore Roosevelt

REFERENDUM, n.  A law for submission of proposed legislation to a 
popular vote to learn the nonsensus of public opinion.
REFLECTION, n.  An action of the mind whereby we obtain a clearer view 
of our relation to the things of yesterday and are able to avoid the 
perils that we shall not again encounter.
REFORM, v.  A thing that mostly satisfies reformers opposed to 
reformation.
REFUGE, n.  Anything assuring protection to one in peril.  Moses and 
Joshua provided six cities of refuge — Bezer, Golan, Ramoth, Kadesh, 
Schekem and Hebron — to which one who had taken life inadvertently 
could flee when hunted by relatives of the deceased.  This admirable 
expedient supplied him with wholesome exercise and enabled them to 
enjoy the pleasures of the chase; whereby the soul of the dead man was 
appropriately honored by observations akin to the funeral games of 
early Greece.
REFUSAL, n.  Denial of something desired; as an elderly maiden’s hand 
in marriage, to a rich and handsome suitor; a valuable franchise to a 
rich corporation, by an alderman; absolution to an impenitent king, by 
a priest, and so forth.  Refusals are graded in a descending scale of 
finality thus:  the refusal absolute, the refusal condition, the 
refusal tentative and the refusal feminine.  The last is called by 
some casuists the refusal assentive.
REGALIA, n.  Distinguishing insignia, jewels and costume of such 
ancient and honorable orders as Knights of Adam; Visionaries of 
Detectable Bosh; the Ancient Order of Modern Troglodytes; the League 
of Holy Humbug; the Golden Phalanx of Phalangers; the Genteel Society 
of Expurgated Hoodlums; the Mystic Alliances of Georgeous Regalians; 
Knights and Ladies of the Yellow Dog; the Oriental Order of Sons of 
the West; the Blatherhood of Insufferable Stuff; Warriors of the Long 
Bow; Guardians of the Great Horn Spoon; the Band of Brutes; the 
Impenitent Order of Wife-Beaters; the Sublime Legion of Flamboyant 
Conspicuants; Worshipers at the Electroplated Shrine; Shining 
Inaccessibles; Fee-Faw-Fummers of the inimitable Grip; Jannissaries of 
the Broad-Blown Peacock; Plumed Increscencies of the Magic Temple; the 
Grand Cabal of Able-Bodied Sedentarians; Associated Deities of the 
Butter Trade; the Garden of Galoots; the Affectionate Fraternity of 
Men Similarly Warted; the Flashing Astonishers; Ladies of Horror; 
Cooperative Association for Breaking into the Spotlight; Dukes of Eden; 
Disciples Militant of the Hidden Faith; Knights-Champions of the 
Domestic Dog; the Holy Gregarians; the Resolute Optimists; the Ancient 
Sodality of Inhospitable Hogs; Associated Sovereigns of Mendacity; 
Dukes-Guardian of the Mystic Cess-Pool; the Society for Prevention of 
Prevalence; Kings of Drink; Polite Federation of Gents-Consequential; 
the Mysterious Order of the Undecipherable Scroll; Uniformed Rank of 
Lousy Cats; Monarchs of Worth and Hunger; Sons of the South Star; 
Prelates of the Tub-and-Sword.
RELIGION, n.  A daughter of Hope and Fear, explaining to Ignorance the 
nature of the Unknowable.
  “What is your religion my son?” inquired the Archbishop of Rheims.
  “Pardon, monseigneur,” replied Rochebriant; “I am ashamed of it."
  “Then why do you not become an atheist?"
  “Impossible!  I should be ashamed of atheism."
  “In that case, monsieur, you should join the Protestants.”
RELIQUARY, n.  A receptacle for such sacred objects as pieces of the 
true cross, short-ribs of the saints, the ears of Balaam’s ass, the 
lung of the cock that called Peter to repentance and so forth.  
Reliquaries are commonly of metal, and provided with a lock to prevent 
the contents from coming out and performing miracles at unseasonable 
times.  A feather from the wing of the Angel of the Annunciation once 
escaped during a sermon in Saint Peter’s and so tickled the noses of 
the congregation that they woke and sneezed with great vehemence three 
times each.  It is related in the “Gesta Sanctorum” that a sacristan 
in the Canterbury cathedral surprised the head of Saint Dennis in the 
library.  Reprimanded by its stern custodian, it explained that it was 
seeking a body of doctrine.  This unseemly levity so raged the 
diocesan that the offender was publicly anathematized, thrown into the 
Stour and replaced by another head of Saint Dennis, brought from Rome.
RENOWN, n.  A degree of distinction between notoriety and fame — a 
little more supportable than the one and a little more intolerable 
than the other.  Sometimes it is conferred by an unfriendly and 
inconsiderate hand.
  I touched the harp in every key,
      But found no heeding ear;
  And then Ithuriel touched me
      With a revealing spear.
  Not all my genius, great as ’tis,
      Could urge me out of night.
  I felt the faint appulse of his,
      And leapt into the light!
W.J. Candleton

REPARATION, n.  Satisfaction that is made for a wrong and deducted 
from the satisfaction felt in committing it.
REPARTEE, n.  Prudent insult in retort.  Practiced by gentlemen with a 
constitutional aversion to violence, but a strong disposition to 
offend.  In a war of words, the tactics of the North American Indian.
REPENTANCE, n.  The faithful attendant and follower of Punishment.  It 
is usually manifest in a degree of reformation that is not 
inconsistent with continuity of sin.
  Desirous to avoid the pains of Hell,
  You will repent and join the Church, Parnell?
  How needless! — Nick will keep you off the coals
  And add you to the woes of other souls.
Jomater Abemy

REPLICA, n.  A reproduction of a work of art, by the artist that made 
the original.  It is so called to distinguish it from a “copy,” which 
is made by another artist.  When the two are mae with equal skill the 
replica is the more valuable, for it is supposed to be more beautiful 
than it looks.
REPORTER, n.  A writer who guesses his way to the truth and dispels it 
with a tempest of words.
  “More dear than all my bosom knows, O thou
  Whose ’lips are sealed’ and will not disavow!"
  So sang the blithe reporter-man as grew
  Beneath his hand the leg-long “interview.”
Barson Maith

REPOSE, v.i.  To cease from troubling.
REPRESENTATIVE, n.  In national politics, a member of the Lower House 
in this world, and without discernible hope of promotion in the next.
REPROBATION, n.  In theology, the state of a luckless mortal 
prenatally damned.  The doctrine of reprobation was taught by Calvin, 
whose joy in it was somewhat marred by the sad sincerity of his 
conviction that although some are foredoomed to perdition, others are 
predestined to salvation.
REPUBLIC, n.  A nation in which, the thing governing and the thing 
governed being the same, there is only a permitted authority to 
enforce an optional obedience.  In a republic, the foundation of 
public order is the ever lessening habit of submission inherited from 
ancestors who, being truly governed, submitted because they had to.  
There are as many kinds of republics as there are graduations between 
the despotism whence they came and the anarchy whither they lead.
REQUIEM, n.  A mass for the dead which the minor poets assure us the 
winds sing o’er the graves of their favorites.  Sometimes, by way of 
providing a varied entertainment, they sing a dirge.
RESIDENT, adj.  Unable to leave.
RESIGN, v.t.  To renounce an honor for an advantage.  To renounce an 
advantage for a greater advantage.
  ’Twas rumored Leonard Wood had signed
      A true renunciation
  Of title, rank and every kind
      Of military station —
      Each honorable station.
  By his example fired — inclined
      To noble emulation,
  The country humbly was resigned
      To Leonard’s resignation —
      His Christian resignation.
Politian Greame

RESOLUTE, adj.  Obstinate in a course that we approve.
RESPECTABILITY, n.  The offspring of a liaison between a bald head 
and a bank account.
RESPIRATOR, n.  An apparatus fitted over the nose and mouth of an 
inhabitant of London, whereby to filter the visible universe in its 
passage to the lungs.
RESPITE, n.  A suspension of hostilities against a sentenced assassin, 
to enable the Executive to determine whether the murder may not have 
been done by the prosecuting attorney.  Any break in the continuity of 
a disagreeable expectation.
  Altgeld upon his incandescend bed
  Lay, an attendant demon at his head.
  “O cruel cook, pray grant me some relief —
  Some respite from the roast, however brief.”
  “Remember how on earth I pardoned all
  Your friends in Illinois when held in thrall.”
  “Unhappy soul! for that alone you squirm
  O’er fire unquenched, a never-dying worm.
  “Yet, for I pity your uneasy state,
  Your doom I’ll mollify and pains abate.
  “Naught, for a season, shall your comfort mar,
  Not even the memory of who you are.”
  Throughout eternal space dread silence fell;
  Heaven trembled as Compassion entered Hell.
  “As long, sweet demon, let my respite be
  As, governing down here, I’d respite thee.”
  “As long, poor soul, as any of the pack
  You thrust from jail consumed in getting back.”
  A genial chill affected Altgeld’s hide
  While they were turning him on t’other side.
Joel Spate Woop

RESPLENDENT, adj.  Like a simple American citizen beduking himself in 
his lodge, or affirming his consequence in the Scheme of Things as an 
elemental unit of a parade.
      The Knights of Dominion were so resplendent in their velvet- 
  and-gold that their masters would hardly have known them.
“Chronicles of the Classes”

RESPOND, v.i.  To make answer, or disclose otherwise a consciousness 
of having inspired an interest in what Herbert Spencer calls “external 
coexistences,” as Satan “squat like a toad” at the ear of Eve, 
responded to the touch of the angel’s spear.  To respond in damages is 
to contribute to the maintenance of the plaintiff’s attorney and, 
incidentally, to the gratification of the plaintiff.
RESPONSIBILITY, n.  A detachable burden easily shifted to the 
shoulders of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one’s neighbor.  In the days 
of astrology it was customary to unload it upon a star.
  Alas, things ain’t what we should see
  If Eve had let that apple be;
  And many a feller which had ought
  To set with monarchses of thought,
  Or play some rosy little game
  With battle-chaps on fields of fame,
  Is downed by his unlucky star
  And hollers:  “Peanuts! — here you are!”
“The Sturdy Beggar”

RESTITUTIONS, n.  The founding or endowing of universities and public 
libraries by gift or bequest.
RESTITUTOR, n.  Benefactor; philanthropist.
RETALIATION, n.  The natural rock upon which is reared the Temple of 
Law.
RETRIBUTION, n.  A rain of fire-and-brimstone that falls alike upon 
the just and such of the unjust as have not procured shelter by 
evicting them.
  In the lines following, addressed to an Emperor in exile by Father 
Gassalasca Jape, the reverend poet appears to hint his sense of the 
improduence of turning about to face Retribution when it is talking 
exercise:
  What, what! Dom Pedro, you desire to go
      Back to Brazil to end your days in quiet?
  Why, what assurance have you ’twould be so?
      ’Tis not so long since you were in a riot,
      And your dear subjects showed a will to fly at
  Your throat and shake you like a rat.  You know
  That empires are ungrateful; are you certain
  Republics are less handy to get hurt in?
REVEILLE, n.  A signal to sleeping soldiers to dream of battlefields 
no more, but get up and have their blue noses counted.  In the 
American army it is ingeniously called “rev-e-lee,” and to that 
pronunciation our countrymen have pledged their lives, their 
misfortunes and their sacred dishonor.
REVELATION, n.  A famous book in which St. John the Divine concealed 
all that he knew.  The revealing is done by the commentators, who know 
nothing.
REVERENCE, n.  The spiritual attitude of a man to a god and a dog to a 
man.
REVIEW, v.t.
  To set your wisdom (holding not a doubt of it,
      Although in truth there’s neither bone nor skin to it)
  At work upon a book, and so read out of it
      The qualities that you have first read into it.
REVOLUTION, n.  In politics, an abrupt change in the form of 
misgovernment.  Specifically, in American history, the substitution of 
the rule of an Administration for that of a Ministry, whereby the 
welfare and happiness of the people were advanced a full half-inch.  
Revolutions are usually accompanied by a considerable effusion of 
blood, but are accounted worth it — this appraisement being made by 
beneficiaries whose blood had not the mischance to be shed.  The 
French revolution is of incalculable value to the Socialist of to-day; 
when he pulls the string actuating its bones its gestures are 
inexpressibly terrifying to gory tyrants suspected of fomenting law 
and order.
RHADOMANCER, n.  One who uses a divining-rod in prospecting for 
precious metals in the pocket of a fool.
RIBALDRY, n.  Censorious language by another concerning oneself.
RIBROASTER, n.  Censorious language by oneself concerning another.  
The word is of classical refinement, and is even said to have been 
used in a fable by Georgius Coadjutor, one of the most fastidious 
writers of the fifteenth century — commonly, indeed, regarded as the 
founder of the Fastidiotic School.
RICE-WATER, n.  A mystic beverage secretly used by our most popular 
novelists and poets to regulate the imagination and narcotize the 
conscience.  It is said to be rich in both obtundite and lethargine, 
and is brewed in a midnight fog by a fat which of the Dismal Swamp.
RICH, adj.  Holding in trust and subject to an accounting the property 
of the indolent, the incompetent, the unthrifty, the envious and the 
luckless.  That is the view that prevails in the underworld, where the 
Brotherhood of Man finds its most logical development and candid 
advocacy.  To denizens of the midworld the word means good and wise.
RICHES, n.
      A gift from Heaven signifying, “This is my beloved son, in 
  whom I am well pleased.”
John D. Rockefeller

      The reward of toil and virtue.
J.P. Morgan

      The sayings of many in the hands of one.
Eugene Debs

  To these excellent definitions the inspired lexicographer feels 
that he can add nothing of value.
RIDICULE, n.  Words designed to show that the person of whom they are 
uttered is devoid of the dignity of character distinguishing him who 
utters them.  It may be graphic, mimetic or merely rident.  
Shaftesbury is quoted as having pronounced it the test of truth — a 
ridiculous assertion, for many a solemn fallacy has undergone 
centuries of ridicule with no abatement of its popular acceptance.  
What, for example, has been more valorously derided than the doctrine 
of Infant Respectability?
RIGHT, n.  Legitimate authority to be, to do or to have; as the right 
to be a king, the right to do one’s neighbor, the right to have 
measles, and the like.  The first of these rights was once universally 
believed to be derived directly from the will of God; and this is 
still sometimes affirmed in partibus infidelium outside the 
enlightened realms of Democracy; as the well known lines of Sir 
Abednego Bink, following:
      By what right, then, do royal rulers rule?
          Whose is the sanction of their state and pow’r?
      He surely were as stubborn as a mule
          Who, God unwilling, could maintain an hour
  His uninvited session on the throne, or air
  His pride securely in the Presidential chair.
      Whatever is is so by Right Divine;
          Whate’er occurs, God wills it so.  Good land!
      It were a wondrous thing if His design
          A fool could baffle or a rogue withstand!
  If so, then God, I say (intending no offence)
  Is guilty of contributory negligence.
RIGHTEOUSNESS, n.  A sturdy virtue that was once found among the 
Pantidoodles inhabiting the lower part of the peninsula of Oque.  Some 
feeble attempts were made by returned missionaries to introduce it 
into several European countries, but it appears to have been 
imperfectly expounded.  An example of this faulty exposition is found 
in the only extant sermon of the pious Bishop Rowley, a characteristic 
passage from which is here given:
      “Now righteousness consisteth not merely in a holy state of 
  mind, nor yet in performance of religious rites and obedience to 
  the letter of the law.  It is not enough that one be pious and 
  just:  one must see to it that others also are in the same state; 
  and to this end compulsion is a proper means.  Forasmuch as my 
  injustice may work ill to another, so by his injustice may evil be 
  wrought upon still another, the which it is as manifestly my duty 
  to estop as to forestall mine own tort.  Wherefore if I would be 
  righteous I am bound to restrain my neighbor, by force if needful, 
  in all those injurious enterprises from which, through a better 
  disposition and by the help of Heaven, I do myself restrain.”
RIME, n.  Agreeing sounds in the terminals of verse, mostly bad.  The 
verses themselves, as distinguished from prose, mostly dull.  Usually 
(and wickedly) spelled “rhyme.”
RIMER, n.  A poet regarded with indifference or disesteem.
  The rimer quenches his unheeded fires,
  The sound surceases and the sense expires.
  Then the domestic dog, to east and west,
  Expounds the passions burning in his breast.
  The rising moon o’er that enchanted land
  Pauses to hear and yearns to understand.
Mowbray Myles

RIOT, n.  A popular entertainment given to the military by innocent 
bystanders.
R.I.P.  A careless abbreviation of requiescat in pace, attesting to 
indolent goodwill to the dead.  According to the learned Dr. Drigge, 
however, the letters originally meant nothing more than reductus in 
pulvis.
RITE, n.  A religious or semi-religious ceremony fixed by law, precept 
or custom, with the essential oil of sincerity carefully squeezed out 
of it.
RITUALISM, n.  A Dutch Garden of God where He may walk in rectilinear 
freedom, keeping off the grass.
ROAD, n.  A strip of land along which one may pass from where it is 
too tiresome to be to where it is futile to go.
  All roads, howsoe’er they diverge, lead to Rome,
  Whence, thank the good Lord, at least one leads back home.
Borey the Bald

ROBBER, n.  A candid man of affairs.
  It is related of Voltaire that one night he and some traveling 
companion lodged at a wayside inn.  The surroundings were suggestive, 
and after supper they agreed to tell robber stories in turn.  “Once 
there was a Farmer-General of the Revenues.”  Saying nothing more, he 
was encouraged to continue.  “That,” he said, “is the story.”
ROMANCE, n.  Fiction that owes no allegiance to the God of Things as 
They Are.  In the novel the writer’s thought is tethered to 
probability, as a domestic horse to the hitching-post, but in romance 
it ranges at will over the entire region of the imagination — free, 
lawless, immune to bit and rein.  Your novelist is a poor creature, as 
Carlyle might say — a mere reporter.  He may invent his characters 
and plot, but he must not imagine anything taking place that might not 
occur, albeit his entire narrative is candidly a lie.  Why he imposes 
this hard condition on himself, and “drags at each remove a 
lengthening chain” of his own forging he can explain in ten thick 
volumes without illuminating by so much as a candle’s ray the black 
profound of his own ignorance of the matter.  There are great novels, 
for great writers have “laid waste their powers” to write them, but it 
remains true that far and away the most fascinating fiction that we 
have is “The Thousand and One Nights.”
ROPE, n.  An obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they 
too are mortal.  It is put about the neck and remains in place one’s 
whole life long.  It has been largely superseded by a more complex 
electrical device worn upon another part of the person; and this is 
rapidly giving place to an apparatus known as the preachment.
ROSTRUM, n.  In Latin, the beak of a bird or the prow of a ship.  In 
America, a place from which a candidate for office energetically 
expounds the wisdom, virtue and power of the rabble.
ROUNDHEAD, n.  A member of the Parliamentarian party in the English 
civil war — so called from his habit of wearing his hair short, 
whereas his enemy, the Cavalier, wore his long.  There were other 
points of difference between them, but the fashion in hair was the 
fundamental cause of quarrel.  The Cavaliers were royalists because 
the king, an indolent fellow, found it more convenient to let his hair 
grow than to wash his neck.  This the Roundheads, who were mostly 
barbers and soap-boilers, deemed an injury to trade, and the royal 
neck was therefore the object of their particular indignation.  
Descendants of the belligerents now wear their hair all alike, but the 
fires of animosity enkindled in that ancient strife smoulder to this 
day beneath the snows of British civility.
RUBBISH, n.  Worthless matter, such as the religions, philosophies, 
literatures, arts and sciences of the tribes infesting the regions 
lying due south from Boreaplas.
RUIN, v.  To destroy.  Specifically, to destroy a maid’s belief in the 
virtue of maids.
RUM, n.  Generically, fiery liquors that produce madness in total 
abstainers.
RUMOR, n.  A favorite weapon of the assassins of character.
  Sharp, irresistible by mail or shield,
      By guard unparried as by flight unstayed,
  O serviceable Rumor, let me wield
      Against my enemy no other blade.
  His be the terror of a foe unseen,
      His the inutile hand upon the hilt,
  And mine the deadly tongue, long, slender, keen,
      Hinting a rumor of some ancient guilt.
  So shall I slay the wretch without a blow,
  Spare me to celebrate his overthrow,
  And nurse my valor for another foe.
Joel Buxter

RUSSIAN, n.  A person with a Caucasian body and a Mongolian soul.  A 
Tartar Emetic.
