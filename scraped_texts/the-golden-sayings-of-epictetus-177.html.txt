When a man prides himself on being able to understand and
interpret the writings of Chrysippus,(19) say to yourself:—
If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this fellow would
have had nothing to be proud of. But what is it that I desire? To
understand Nature, and to follow her! Accordingly I ask who is
the Interpreter. On hearing that it is Chrysippus, I go to him.
But it seems I do not understand what he wrote. So I seek one to
interpret that. So far there is nothing to pride myself upon. But
when I have found my interpreter, what remains is to put in
practice his instructions. This itself is the only thing to be
proud of. But if I admire the interpretation and that alone, what
else have I turned out but a mere commentator instead of a lover
of wisdom?—except indeed that I happen to be interpreting
Chrysippus instead of Homer. So when any one says to me, Prithee,
read me Chrysippus, I am more inclined to blush, when I cannot
show my deeds to be in harmony and accordance with his sayings.
