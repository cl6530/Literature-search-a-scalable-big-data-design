bestowed on everything rather than that which claims it most;
and, to crown all, that you know neither what God nor Man is—

everything else, perhaps you may bear to be told; but to hear
that you know nothing of yourself, how could you submit to that?
How could you stand your ground and suffer that to be proved?
Clearly not at all. You instantly turn away in wrath. Yet what
harm have I done you? Unless indeed the mirror harms the
ill-favoured man by showing him to himself just as he is; unless the
physician can be thought to insult his patient, when he tells

why, you have a fever. Eat nothing to-day, and drink only water."
Yet no one says, “What an insufferable insult!” Whereas, if you
