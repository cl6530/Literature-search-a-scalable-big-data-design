which we may bear everything that comes to pass without being
crushed or depressed thereby; but like a good King and Father, He
has given us this without let or hindrance, placed wholly at our
own disposition, without reserving to Himself any power of
impediment or restraint. Though possessing all these things free

it is you have received nor whence it comes, but sit moaning and
groaning; some of you blind to the Giver, making no
acknowledgment to your Benefactor; others basely giving
