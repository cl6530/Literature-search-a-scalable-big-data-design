gave me being, if thou hadst destined this happiness for me, my
whole life would have been one continual thanksgiving! But I will
not murmur — forgive these tears, forgive these fruitless wishes.
She — my wife! Oh, the very thought of folding that dearest of
Heaven’s creatures in my arms! Dear Wilhelm, my whole frame feels
convulsed when I see Albert put his arms around her slender waist!
And shall I avow it? Why should I not, Wilhelm? She would have
been happier with me than with him. Albert is not the man to
satisfy the wishes of such a heart. He wants a certain sensibility;
he wants — in short, their hearts do not beat in unison. How
often, my dear friend, im reading a passage from some interesting
book, when my heart and Charlotte’s seemed to meet, and in a hundred
other instances when our sentiments were unfolded by the story of
some fictitious character, have I felt that we were made for each
other! But, dear Wilhelm, he loves her with his whole soul; and
what does not such a love deserve?
I have been interrupted by an insufferable visit. I have dried
my tears, and composed my thoughts. Adieu, my best friend!
