In 1993, Alex Alben was a lawyer working at Starwave, Inc. Starwave was an 
innovative company founded by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen to develop digital 
entertainment. Long before the Internet became popular, Starwave began investing 
in new technology for delivering entertainment in anticipation of the power of 
networks.
Alben had a special interest in new technology. He was intrigued by the emerging 
market for CD-ROM technologynot to distribute film, but to do things with film 
that otherwise would be very difficult. In 1993, he launched an initiative to 
develop a product to build retrospectives on the work of particular actors. The 
first actor chosen was Clint Eastwood. The idea was to showcase all of the work 
of Eastwood, with clips from his films and interviews with figures important to 
his career.
At that time, Eastwood had made more than fifty films, as an actor and as a 
director. Alben began with a series of interviews with Eastwood, asking him 
about his career. Because Starwave produced those interviews, it was free to 
include them on the CD.
That alone would not have made a very interesting product, so Starwave wanted to 
add content from the movies in Eastwood’s career: posters, scripts, and other 
material relating to the films Eastwood made. Most of his career was spent at 
Warner Brothers, and so it was relatively easy to get permission for that 
content.
Then Alben and his team decided to include actual film clips. Our goal was that 
we were going to have a clip from every one of East-wood’s films, Alben told 
me. It was here that the problem arose. No one had ever really done this 
before, Alben explained. No one had ever tried to do this in the context of an 
artistic look at an actor’s career.
Alben brought the idea to Michael Slade, the CEO of Starwave. Slade asked, 
Well, what 
will it take?
Alben replied, Well, we’re going to have to clear rights from everyone who 
appears in these films, and the music and everything else that we want to use in 
these film clips. Slade said, Great! Go for it. [1]
The problem was that neither Alben nor Slade had any idea what clearing those 
rights would mean. Every actor in each of the films could have a claim to 
royalties for the reuse of that film. But CD-ROMs had not been specified in the 
contracts for the actors, so there was no clear way to know just what Starwave 
was to do.
I asked Alben how he dealt with the problem. With an obvious pride in his 
resourcefulness that obscured the obvious bizarreness of his tale, Alben 
recounted just what they did:
So we very mechanically went about looking up the film clips. We made some 
artistic decisions about what film clips to includeof course we were going to 
use the Make my day clip from Dirty Harry. But you then need to get the guy 
on the ground who’s wiggling under the gun and you need to get his permission. 
And then you have to decide what you are going to pay him.
We decided that it would be fair if we offered them the day-player rate for the 
right to reuse that performance. We’re talking about a clip of less than a 
minute, but to reuse that performance in the CD-ROM the rate at the time was 
about $600.
So we had to identify the peoplesome of them were hard to identify because in 
Eastwood movies you can’t tell who’s the guy crashing through the glassis it 
the actor or is it the stuntman? And then we just, we put together a team, my 
assistant and some others, and we just started calling people.
Some actors were glad to helpDonald Sutherland, for example, followed up 
himself to be sure that the rights had been cleared. Others were dumbfounded at 
their good fortune. Alben would ask, Hey, can I pay you $600 or maybe if you 
were in two films, you know, $1,200? And they would say, Are you for real? 
Hey, I’d love to get $1,200. And some of course were a bit difficult (estranged 
ex-wives, in particular). But eventually, Alben and his team had cleared the 
rights to this retrospective CD-ROM on Clint Eastwood’s career.
It was one year laterand even then we weren’t sure whether we were totally 
in the clear.
Alben is proud of his work. The project was the first of its kind and the only 
time he knew of that a team had undertaken such a massive project for the 
purpose of releasing a retrospective.
Everyone thought it would be too hard. Everyone just threw up their hands and 
said, Oh, my gosh, a film, it’s so many copyrights, there’s the music, there’s 
the screenplay, there’s the director, there’s the actors. But we just broke it 
down. We just put it into its constituent parts and said, Okay, there’s this 
many actors, this many directors, ... this many musicians, and we just went at 
it very systematically and cleared the rights.
And no doubt, the product itself was exceptionally good. Eastwood loved it, and 
it sold very well.
But I pressed Alben about how weird it seems that it would have to take a year’s 
work simply to clear rights. No doubt Alben had done this efficiently, but as 
Peter Drucker has famously quipped, There is nothing so useless as doing 
efficiently that which should not be done at all. [2] Did it make sense, I 
asked Alben, that this is the way a new work has to be made?
For, as he acknowledged, very few ... have the time and resources, and the will 
to do this, and thus, very few such works would ever be made. Does it make 
sense, I asked him, from the standpoint of what anybody really thought they were 
ever giving rights for originally, that you would have to go clear rights for 
these kinds of clips?
I don’t think so. When an actor renders a performance in a movie, he or she 
gets paid very well. ... And then when 30 seconds of that performance is used in 
a new product that is a retrospective of somebody’s career, I don’t think that 
that person ... should be compensated for that.
Or at least, is this how the artist should be compensated? Would it make 
sense, I asked, for there to be some kind of statutory license that someone 
could pay and be free to make derivative use of clips like this? Did it really 
make sense that a follow-on creator would have to track down every artist, 
actor, director, musician, and get explicit permission from each? Wouldn’t a lot 
more be created if the legal part of the creative process could be made to be 
more clean?
Absolutely. I think that if there were some fair-licensing mechanismwhere you 
weren’t subject to hold-ups and you weren’t subject to estranged former spouses
you’d see a lot more of this work, because it wouldn’t be so daunting to try to 
put together a retrospective of someone’s career and meaningfully illustrate it 
with lots of media from that person’s career. You’d build in a cost as the 
producer of one of these things. You’d build in a cost of paying X dollars to 
the talent that performed. But it would be a known cost. That’s the thing that 
trips everybody up and makes this kind of product hard to get off the ground. If 
you knew I have a hundred minutes of film in this product and it’s going to cost 
me X, then you build your budget around it, and you can get investments and 
everything else that you need to produce it. But if you say, Oh, I want a 
hundred minutes of something and I have no idea what it’s going to cost me, and 
a certain number of people are going to hold me up for money, then it becomes 
difficult to put one of these things together.
Alben worked for a big company. His company was backed by some of the richest 
investors in the world. He therefore had authority and access that the average 
Web designer would not have. So if it took him a year, how long would it take 
someone else? And how much creativity is never made just because the costs of 
clearing the rights are so high?
These costs are the burdens of a kind of regulation. Put on a Republican hat for 
a moment, and get angry for a bit. The government defines the scope of these 
rights, and the scope defined determines how much it’s going to cost to 
negotiate them. (Remember the idea that land runs to the heavens, and imagine 
the pilot purchasing fly- through rights as he negotiates to fly from Los 
Angeles to San Francisco.) These rights might well have once made sense; but as 
circumstances change, they make no sense at all. Or at least, a well-trained, 
regulation-minimizing Republican should look at the rights and ask, Does this 
still make sense?
I’ve seen the flash of recognition when people get this point, but only a few 
times. The first was at a conference of federal judges in California. The judges 
were gathered to discuss the emerging topic of cyber-law. I was asked to be on 
the panel. Harvey Saferstein, a well-respected lawyer from an L.A. firm, 
introduced the panel with a video that he and a friend, Robert Fairbank, had 
produced.
The video was a brilliant collage of film from every period in the twentieth 
century, all framed around the idea of a 60 Minutes episode. The execution was 
perfect, down to the sixty-minute stopwatch. The judges loved every minute of 
it.
When the lights came up, I looked over to my copanelist, David Nimmer, perhaps 
the leading copyright scholar and practitioner in the nation. He had an 
astonished look on his face, as he peered across the room of over 250 well-
entertained judges. Taking an ominous tone, he began his talk with a question: 
Do you know how many federal laws were just violated in this room?
For of course, the two brilliantly talented creators who made this film hadn’t 
done what Alben did. They hadn’t spent a year clearing the rights to these 
clips; technically, what they had done violated the law. Of course, it wasn’t as 
if they or anyone were going to be prosecuted for this violation (the presence 
of 250 judges and a gaggle of federal marshals notwithstanding). But Nimmer was 
making an important point: A year before anyone would have heard of the word 
Napster, and two years before another member of our panel, David Boies, would 
defend Napster before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Nimmer was trying to 
get the judges to see that the law would not be friendly to the capacities that 
this technology would enable. Technology means you can now do amazing things 
easily; but you couldn’t easily do them legally.
We live in a cut and paste culture enabled by technology. Anyone building a 
presentation knows the extraordinary freedom that the cut and paste architecture 
of the Internet createdin a second you can find just about any image you want; 
in another second, you can have it planted in your presentation.
But presentations are just a tiny beginning. Using the Internet and its 
archives, musicians are able to string together mixes of sound never before 
imagined; filmmakers are able to build movies out of clips on computers around 
the world. An extraordinary site in Sweden takes images of politicians and 
blends them with music to create biting political commentary. A site called Camp 
Chaos has produced some of the most biting criticism of the record industry that 
there is through the mixing of Flash! and music.
All of these creations are technically illegal. Even if the creators wanted to 
be legal, the cost of complying with the law is impossibly high. Therefore, 
for the law-abiding sorts, a wealth of creativity is never made. And for that 
part that is made, if it doesn’t follow the clearance rules, it doesn’t get 
released.
To some, these stories suggest a solution: Let’s alter the mix of rights so that 
people are free to build upon our culture. Free to add or mix as they see fit. 
We could even make this change without necessarily requiring that the free use 
be free as in free beer. Instead, the system could simply make it easy for 
follow-on creators to compensate artists without requiring an army of lawyers to 
come along: a rule, for example, that says the royalty owed the copyright owner 
of an unregistered work for the derivative reuse of his work will be a flat 1 
percent of net revenues, to be held in escrow for the copyright owner. Under 
this rule, the copyright owner could benefit from some royalty, but he would not 
have the benefit of a full property right (meaning the right to name his own 
price) unless he registers the work.
Who could possibly object to this? And what reason would there be for objecting? 
We’re talking about work that is not now being made; which if made, under this 
plan, would produce new income for artists. What reason would anyone have to 
oppose it?
In February 2003, DreamWorks studios announced an agreement with Mike Myers, the 
comic genius of Saturday Night Live and Austin Powers. According to the 
announcement, Myers and DreamWorks would work together to form a unique 
filmmaking pact. Under the agreement, DreamWorks will acquire the rights to 
existing motion picture hits and classics, write new storylines andwith the use 
of state- of-the-art digital technologyinsert Myers and other actors into the 
film, thereby creating an entirely new piece of entertainment.
The announcement called this film sampling. As Myers explained, Film Sampling 
is an exciting way to put an original spin on existing films and allow audiences 
to see old movies in a new light. Rap artists have been doing this for years 
with music and now we are able to take that same concept and apply it to film. 
Steven Spielberg is quoted as saying, If anyone can create a way to bring old 
films to new audiences, it is Mike.
Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if you don’t 
think about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point about this 
announcement. As the vast majority of our film heritage remains under copyright, 
the real meaning of the DreamWorks announcement is just this: It is Mike Myers 
and only Mike Myers who is free to sample. Any general freedom to build upon the 
film archive of our culture, a freedom in other contexts presumed for us all, is 
now a privilege reserved for the funny and famousand presumably rich.
This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first continues 
the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of fair use. Much of sampling 
should be considered fair use. But few would rely upon so weak a doctrine to 
create. That leads to the second reason that the privilege is reserved for the 
few: The costs of negotiating the legal rights for the creative reuse of content 
are astronomically high. These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either 
pay a lawyer to defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down 
permissions so you don’t have to rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the 
creative process is a process of paying lawyersagain a privilege, or perhaps a 
curse, reserved for the few.
