“Just the DAY for a Whisky Rebellion,” said Aunt Polly and off
she ran, lipperty-lipperty-lip, to get a few shooting rifles.
“Oh goody goody,” cried little Emily.  “Now we can all shoot at
those horrid Revenue Officers,” for the collectors of internal
revenue were far from popular with these kindly Pennsylvania folk
and Aunt Polly Pinkwood had often promised the children that if
they were good some day they would be allowed to take a shot at a
Revenue Officer.
Soon she returned, bearing in her arms a number of bright shiny
new guns. The children crowded around in glee and soon all were
supplied with weapons except little Frank who of course was too
young to use a gun and was given a two-gallon jug of nice, old
whisky to carry. Jed hitched up old Taylor, the faithful farm
horse, and as quick as you could say Jack Robinson the little
ones had piled into the old carryall. Round Mr. Sun was just
peeping over the Purple Hills when the merry little party started
on its way, singing and laughing at the prospect of the day’s
sport.
“I bet I kill five Revenue Officers,” said little Edgar.
“Ha Ha Ha—you boaster, you,” laughed Aunt Polly.  “You will be
lucky if you kill two, for I fear they will be hard to find
today.”
“Oh do you think so, Aunt Polly?” said little Elinor and she
began to cry, for Elinor dearly loved to shoot.
“Hush dear,” said Miss Pinkwood with a kindly pat, for she loved
her little charges and it hurt her to see them unhappy. “I was
only joking.  And now children I will tell you a story.”
“Oh goody goody,” cried they all.  “Tell us a true story.”
“All right,” said Aunt Polly.  “I shall tell you a true story,"
and she began.
“Once there was a brave handsome man—”
“Mr. Welsbach,” cried the children with one voice, for it was
well known in the neighborhood that Aunt Polly had long been
sweet on Julius Welsbach, the popular superintendent of the
Sabbath School and the best whisky maker for miles around.
“Hush children,” said Aunt Polly blushing in vexation.  “Of
course not. And if you interrupt me I shall not tell my story at
all.” But she was not really angry.
“And one day this brave handsome man was out making whisky and he
had just sampled some when he looked up and what do you suppose
he saw?”
“Snakes,” cried little Elmer whose father had often had delirium
tremens, greatly to the delight of his children.
“No, Elmer,” said Miss Pinkwood, “not snakes.”
“Pink lizards,” cried little Esther, Elmer’s sister.
“No,” said Aunt Polly, with a hearty laugh, “he saw a—stranger.
And what do you suppose the stranger had?”
“A snoot full,” chorused the Schultz twins.  “He was pie-eyed.”
“No,” replied Miss Pinkwood laughing merrily.  “It was before
noon. Guess again children.  What did the stranger have?”
“Blind staggers,” suggested little Faith whose mother had
recently been adjudged insane.
“Come children,” replied Aunt Polly.  “You are not very wide
awake this morning.  The stranger had a gun.  And when the brave
handsome man offered the stranger a drink what do you suppose the
stranger said?”
“I know,” cried little Prudence eagerly.  “He said, ’Why yes I
don’t care if I do.’  That’s what they all say.”
“No, Prudence,” replied Miss Pinkwood.  “The stranger refused a
drink.”
“Oh come now, Aunt Polly,” chorused the boys and girls. “You said
you were going to tell us a true story.” And their little faces
fell.
“Children,” said Miss Polly, “the stranger refused the drink
because he was a Revenue Officer.  And he pointed his gun at the
brave handsome man and said he would have to go to jail because
he had not paid the tax on his whisky. And the brave handsome man
would have had to have gone to jail, too; but fortunately his
brother came up just at the right time and—”
“Shot the Revenuer dead,” cried the children in glee.
“Yes children,” said Miss Polly.  “He shot the Revenue Officer
dead.”
“Oh goody goody,” cried all.  “Now tell us another story. Tell us
about the time your father killed a Revenue Officer with an ax.”
“Oh you don’t want to hear that again, do you children?” said
Aunt Polly.
“Oh yes—yes—please,” they cried, and Aunt Polly was just going
to begin when Jed the driver stopped his horses and said:
“This hilltop is as good a place to shoot from as I know of, Miss
Pinkwood.  You can see both roads, and nobody can see you.”
“Thank you, Jed,” said Aunt Polly giving him a kindly smile, and
without more ado the children clambered out of the carryall and
filled their guns with powder and bullets.
“I get first shot,” proudly announced Robert, the oldest boy, and
somewhat of a bully.
“Robert!” said Aunt Polly severely, and she looked almost ready
to cry, for Aunt Polly had tried hard to teach the boys to be
true knights of chivalry and it hurt her to have Robert wish to
shoot a Revenue Officer before the girls had had a chance. Robert
had not meant to hurt Aunt Polly’s feelings but had only been
thoughtless, and soon all was sunshine again as little Ellen the
youngest made ready to fire the first shot.
The children waited patiently and soon they were rewarded by the
sight of a Revenue Officer riding on horseback in the distant
valley, as pretty a target as one could wish.
“Now do be careful, dear,” whispered Miss Pinkwood, “for if you
miss, he may take alarm and be off.”  But little Ellen did not
miss.  “Bang” went her gun and the little Merry Breezes echoed
back and forth, “She got him. She got him”, and old Mother West
Wind smiled down at the happy sport.  Sure enough, when old Mr.
Smoke had cleared away there was a nice dead Revenue Officer
lying in the road. “Well done, Ellen,” said Miss Pinkwood,
patting her little charge affectionately which caused the happy
girl to coo with childish delight.
Mary had next shot and soon all were popping away in great glee.
All the merry wood folk gathered near to watch the children at
their sport. There was Johnny Chuck and Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk
and Bobby Coon and oh everybody.
Soon round Mr. Sun was high in the Blue Sky and the children
began to tire somewhat of their sport.  “I’m as hungry as a
bear,” said little Dick.  “I’m as hungry as two bears,” said
Emily. “Ha Ha Ha,” laughed Miss Pinkwood, “I know what will fix
that,” and soon she had spread out a delicious repast.  “Now
children,” said Miss Pinkwood when all had washed their faces and
hands, “while you were busy washing I prepared a surprise for
you,” and from a large jug, before their delighted gaze, she
poured out— what do you think?  “Bronxes,” cried little Harriet. 
“Oh goody goody.” And sure enough Aunt Polly had prepared a jug
of delicious Bronx cocktails which all pronounced excellent.
And after that there were sandwiches and olives and pie and good
three year old whisky, too.
“That’s awfully smooth rye, Aunt Polly,” said little Prudence
smacking her two red lips.  “I think I’ll have another shot.”
“No dear,” said Miss Pinkwood, pleased by the compliment, but
firm withal. “Not now.  Perhaps on the way home, if there is any
left,” for Aunt Polly knew that too much alcohol in the middle of
the day is bad for growing children, and she had seen many a
promising child spoiled by over-indulgent parents.
After lunch those children who could stand helped Aunt Polly to
clear away the dishes and then all went sound asleep, as is the
custom in Pennsylvania.
When they awoke round Mr. Sun was just sinking behind the Purple
Hills and so, after taking a few more scattered shots at Revenue
Officers, they piled once more into the carryall and drove back
to town. And as they passed Mrs. Oliphant’s house (Aunt Polly’s
sister) Aunt Flo Oliphant came out on the porch and waved her
handkerchief at the merry party.
“Let’s give her a cheer,” said Fred.
“Agreed,” cried they all, and so twelve little throats united in
three lusty “huzzahs” which made Auntie Flo very happy you may be
sure.
And as they drove up before the Pinkwoods’ modest home twelve
tired but happy children with one accord voted the Whisky
Rebellion capital fun and Aunt Polly a brick.
