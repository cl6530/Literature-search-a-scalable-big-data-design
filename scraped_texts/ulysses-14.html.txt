SHORTS, MASTER DONALD TURNBULL, MASTER ABRAHAM CHATTERTON, MASTER OWEN
GOLDBERG, MASTER JACK MEREDITH, MASTER PERCY APJOHN, STAND IN A CLEARING
OF THE TREES AND SHOUT TO MASTER LEOPOLD BLOOM.)
THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! (THEY CHEER)
BLOOM: (HOBBLEDEHOY, WARMGLOVED, MAMMAMUFFLERED, STARRED WITH SPENT
SNOWBALLS, STRUGGLES TO RISE) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let’s
ring all the bells in Montague street. (HE CHEERS FEEBLY) Hurray for the
High School!
THE ECHO: Fool!
THE YEWS: (RUSTLING) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (WHISPERED KISSES
ARE HEARD IN ALL THE WOOD. FACES OF HAMADRYADS PEEP OUT FROM THE BOLES
AND AMONG THE LEAVES AND BREAK, BLOSSOMING INTO BLOOM.) Who profaned our
silent shade?
THE NYMPH: (COYLY, THROUGH PARTING FINGERS) There? In the open air?
THE YEWS: (SWEEPING DOWNWARD) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
The Waterfall:
    Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
    Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.
THE NYMPH: (WITH WIDE FINGERS) O, infamy!
BLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of the
forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time.
Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired,
I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains with poor papa’s
operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto
bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their
crooked tree and I ... A saint couldn’t resist it. The demon possessed
me. Besides, who saw?
(STAGGERING BOB, A WHITEPOLLED CALF, THRUSTS A RUMINATING HEAD WITH HUMID
NOSTRILS THROUGH THE FOLIAGE.)
STAGGERING BOB: (LARGE TEARDROPS ROLLING FROM HIS PROMINENT EYES,
SNIVELS) Me. Me see.
BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I ... (WITH PATHOS) No girl would when I
went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn’t play ...
(HIGH ON BEN HOWTH THROUGH RHODODENDRONS A NANNYGOAT PASSES,
PLUMPUDDERED, BUTTYTAILED, DROPPING CURRANTS.)
THE NANNYGOAT: (BLEATS) Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!
BLOOM: (HATLESS, FLUSHED, COVERED WITH BURRS OF THISTLEDOWN AND
GORSESPINE) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (HE GAZES
INTENTLY DOWNWARDS ON THE WATER) Thirtytwo head over heels per second.
Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government
printer’s clerk. (THROUGH SILVERSILENT SUMMER AIR THE DUMMY OF BLOOM,
ROLLED IN A MUMMY, ROLLS ROTEATINGLY FROM THE LION’S HEAD CLIFF INTO THE
PURPLE WAITING WATERS.)
THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!
(FAR OUT IN THE BAY BETWEEN BAILEY AND KISH LIGHTS THE Erin’s King SAILS,
SENDING A BROADENING PLUME OF COALSMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL TOWARDS THE
LAND.)
COUNCILLOR NANNETII: (ALONE ON DECK, IN DARK ALPACA, YELLOWKITEFACED, HIS
HAND IN HIS WAISTCOAT OPENING, DECLAIMS) When my country takes her place
among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph
be written. I have ...
BLOOM: Done. Prff!
THE NYMPH: (LOFTILY) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a
place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat
electric light. (SHE ARCHES HER BODY IN LASCIVIOUS CRISPATION, PLACING
HER FOREFINGER IN HER MOUTH) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then
could you ...?
BLOOM: (PAWING THE HEATHER ABJECTLY) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas
too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which add a
tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long’s
syringe, the ladies’ friend.
THE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. (SHE BLUSHES AND MAKES A KNEE)
And the rest!
BLOOM: (DEJECTED) Yes. PECCAVI! I have paid homage on that living altar
where the back changes name. (WITH SUDDEN FERVOUR) For why should the
dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules ...?
(FIGURES WIND SERPENTING IN SLOW WOODLAND PATTERN AROUND THE TREESTEMS,
COOEEING)
THE VOICE OF KITTY: (IN THE THICKET) Show us one of them cushions.
THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.
(a Grouse Wings Clumsily Through the Underwood.)
THE VOICE OF LYNCH: (IN THE THICKET) Whew! Piping hot!
THE VOICE OF ZOE: (FROM THE THICKET) Came from a hot place.
THE VOICE OF VIRAG: (A BIRDCHIEF, BLUESTREAKED AND FEATHERED IN WAR
PANOPLY WITH HIS ASSEGAI, STRIDING THROUGH A CRACKLING CANEBRAKE OVER
BEECHMAST AND ACORNS) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit
where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.
The Waterfall:
    Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
    Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!
THE NYMPH: (EYELESS, IN NUN’S WHITE HABIT, COIF AND HUGEWINGED WIMPLE,
SOFTLY, WITH REMOTE EYES) Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount
Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (SHE
RECLINES HER HEAD, SIGHING) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull
waves o’er the waters dull.
(bloom Half Rises. His Back Trouserbutton Snaps.)
THE BUTTON: Bip!
(TWO SLUTS OF THE COOMBE DANCE RAINILY BY, SHAWLED, YELLING FLATLY.)
THE SLUTS:
    O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
    He didn’t know what to do,
    To keep it up,
    To keep it up.
BLOOM: (COLDLY) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were
only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but
willing like an ass pissing.
THE YEWS: (THEIR SILVERFOIL OF LEAVES PRECIPITATING, THEIR SKINNY ARMS
AGING AND SWAYING) Deciduously!
THE NYMPH: (her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit)
Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A LARGE MOIST STAIN APPEARS ON HER
ROBE) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure
woman. (SHE CLUTCHES AGAIN IN HER ROBE) Wait. Satan, you’ll sing no more
lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (SHE DRAWS A PONIARD AND, CLAD IN THE
SHEATHMAIL OF AN ELECTED KNIGHT OF NINE, STRIKES AT HIS LOINS) Nekum!
BLOOM: (STARTS UP, SEIZES HER HAND) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o’ nine lives!
Fair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do
you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (HE CLUTCHES
HER VEIL) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the
spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus, eh
Reynard?
THE NYMPH: (WITH A CRY FLEES FROM HIM UNVEILED, HER PLASTER CAST
CRACKING, A CLOUD OF STENCH ESCAPING FROM THE CRACKS) Poli ...!
BLOOM: (CALLS AFTER HER) As if you didn’t get it on the double
yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it.
Your strength our weakness. What’s our studfee? What will you pay on the
nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. (THE FLEEING NYMPH
RAISES A KEEN) Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me.
And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool
someone else, not me. (HE SNIFFS) Rut. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.
(the Figure of Bella Cohen Stands Before Him.)
BELLA: You’ll know me the next time.
BLOOM: (COMPOSED, REGARDS HER) Passee. Mutton dressed as lamb. Long in
the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night would
benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are
as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions
of your other features, that’s all. I’m not a triple screw propeller.
BELLA: (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) You’re not game, in fact. (HER SOWCUNT BARKS)
Fbhracht!
BLOOM: (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) Clean your nailless middle finger first, your
bully’s cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay
and wipe yourself.
BELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
BELLA: (TURNS TO THE PIANO) Which of you was playing the dead march from
SAUL?
ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. (SHE DARTS TO THE PIANO AND BANGS CHORDS
ON IT WITH CROSSED ARMS) The cat’s ramble through the slag. (SHE GLANCES
BACK) Eh? Who’s making love to my sweeties? (SHE DARTS BACK TO THE TABLE)
What’s yours is mine and what’s mine is my own.
(KITTY, DISCONCERTED, COATS HER TEETH WITH THE SILVER PAPER. BLOOM
APPROACHES ZOE.)
BLOOM: (GENTLY) Give me back that potato, will you?
ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
BLOOM: (WITH FEELING) It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.
Zoe:
    Give a thing and take it back
    God’ll ask you where is that
    You’ll say you don’t know
    God’ll send you down below.
BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.
ZOE: Here. (SHE HAULS UP A REEF OF HER SLIP, REVEALING HER BARE THIGH,
AND UNROLLS THE POTATO FROM THE TOP OF HER STOCKING) Those that hides
knows where to find.
BELLA: (FROWNS) Here. This isn’t a musical peepshow. And don’t you smash
that piano. Who’s paying here?
(SHE GOES TO THE PIANOLA. STEPHEN FUMBLES IN HIS POCKET AND, TAKING OUT A
BANKNOTE BY ITS CORNER, HANDS IT TO HER.)
STEPHEN: (WITH EXAGGERATED POLITENESS) This silken purse I made out of
the sow’s ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (HE
INDICATES VAGUELY LYNCH AND BLOOM) We are all in the same sweepstake,
Kinch and Lynch. DANS CE BORDEL OU TENONS NOSTRE ETAT.
LYNCH: (CALLS FROM THE HEARTH) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.
STEPHEN: (HANDS BELLA A COIN) Gold. She has it.
BELLA: (LOOKS AT THE MONEY, THEN AT STEPHEN, THEN AT ZOE, FLORRY AND
KITTY) Do you want three girls? It’s ten shillings here.
STEPHEN: (DELIGHTEDLY) A hundred thousand apologies. (HE FUMBLES AGAIN
AND TAKES OUT AND HANDS HER TWO CROWNS) Permit, BREVI MANU, my sight is
somewhat troubled.
(BELLA GOES TO THE TABLE TO COUNT THE MONEY WHILE STEPHEN TALKS TO
HIMSELF IN MONOSYLLABLES. ZOE BENDS OVER THE TABLE. KITTY LEANS OVER
ZOE’S NECK. LYNCH GETS UP, RIGHTS HIS CAP AND, CLASPING KITTY’S WAIST,
ADDS HIS HEAD TO THE GROUP.)
FLORRY: (STRIVES HEAVILY TO RISE) Ow! My foot’s asleep. (SHE LIMPS OVER
TO THE TABLE. BLOOM APPROACHES.)
BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: (CHATTERING AND SQUABBLING) The
gentleman ... ten shillings ... paying for the three ... allow me a
moment ... this gentleman pays separate ... who’s touching it? ... ow!
... mind who you’re pinching ... are you staying the night or a short
time?... who did?... you’re a liar, excuse me ... the gentleman paid down
like a gentleman ... drink ... it’s long after eleven.
STEPHEN: (AT THE PIANOLA, MAKING A GESTURE OF ABHORRENCE) No bottles!
What, eleven? A riddle!
ZOE: (LIFTING UP HER PETTIGOWN AND FOLDING A HALF SOVEREIGN INTO THE TOP
OF HER STOCKING) Hard earned on the flat of my back.
LYNCH: (LIFTING KITTY FROM THE TABLE) Come!
KITTY: Wait. (SHE CLUTCHES THE TWO CROWNS)
FLORRY: And me?
LYNCH: Hoopla! (HE LIFTS HER, CARRIES HER AND BUMPS HER DOWN ON THE
SOFA.)
Stephen:
    The fox crew, the cocks flew,
    The bells in heaven
    Were striking eleven.
    ’Tis time for her poor soul
    To get out of heaven.
BLOOM: (QUIETLY LAYS A HALF SOVEREIGN ON THE TABLE BETWEEN BELLA AND
FLORRY) So. Allow me. (HE TAKES UP THE POUNDNOTE) Three times ten. We’re
square.
BELLA: (ADMIRINGLY) You’re such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.
ZOE: (POINTS) Him? Deep as a drawwell. (LYNCH BENDS KITTY BACK OVER THE
SOFA AND KISSES HER. BLOOM GOES WITH THE POUNDNOTE TO STEPHEN.)
BLOOM: This is yours.
STEPHEN: How is that? LES DISTRAIT or absentminded beggar. (HE FUMBLES
AGAIN IN HIS POCKET AND DRAWS OUT A HANDFUL OF COINS. AN OBJECT FILLS.)
That fell.
BLOOM: (STOOPING, PICKS UP AND HANDS A BOX OF MATCHES) This.
STEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.
BLOOM: (QUIETLY) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care
of. Why pay more?
STEPHEN: (HANDS HIM ALL HIS COINS) Be just before you are generous.
BLOOM: I will but is it wise? (HE COUNTS) One, seven, eleven, and five.
Six. Eleven. I don’t answer for what you may have lost.
STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next
Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (HE LAUGHS LOUDLY) Burying his grandmother.
Probably he killed her.
BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
STEPHEN: Doesn’t matter a rambling damn.
 BLOOM: No, but ...
STEPHEN: (COMES TO THE TABLE) Cigarette, please. (LYNCH TOSSES A
CIGARETTE FROM THE SOFA TO THE TABLE) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and
married. (A CIGARETTE APPEARS ON THE TABLE. STEPHEN LOOKS AT IT) Wonder.
Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (HE STRIKES A MATCH AND PROCEEDS TO LIGHT THE
CIGARETTE WITH ENIGMATIC MELANCHOLY)
LYNCH: (WATCHING HIM) You would have a better chance of lighting it if
you held the match nearer.
STEPHEN: (BRINGS THE MATCH NEAR HIS EYE) Lynx eye. Must get glasses.
Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat.
(HE DRAWS THE MATCH AWAY. IT GOES OUT.) Brain thinks. Near: far.
Ineluctable modality of the visible. (HE FROWNS MYSTERIOUSLY) Hm. Sphinx.
The beast that has twobacks at midnight. Married.
ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with
him.
FLORRY: (NODS) Mr Lambe from London.
STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
Lynch: (embracing Kitty On the Sofa, Chants Deeply) Dona Nobis Pacem.
(THE CIGARETTE SLIPS FROM STEPHEN ’S FINGERS. BLOOM PICKS IT UP AND
THROWS IT IN THE GRATE.)
BLOOM: Don’t smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (TO ZOE) You have
nothing?
ZOE: Is he hungry?
STEPHEN: (EXTENDS HIS HAND TO HER SMILING AND CHANTS TO THE AIR OF THE
BLOODOATH IN THE Dusk of the Gods)
    Hangende Hunger,
    Fragende Frau,
    Macht uns alle kaputt.
ZOE: (TRAGICALLY) Hamlet, I am thy father’s gimlet! (SHE TAKES HIS HAND)
Blue eyes beauty I’ll read your hand. (SHE POINTS TO HIS FOREHEAD) No
wit, no wrinkles. (SHE COUNTS) Two, three, Mars, that’s courage. (STEPHEN
SHAKES HIS HEAD) No kid.
LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake.
(TO ZOE) Who taught you palmistry?
ZOE: (TURNS) Ask my ballocks that I haven’t got. (TO STEPHEN) I see it in
your face. The eye, like that. (SHE FROWNS WITH LOWERED HEAD)
LYNCH: (LAUGHING, SLAPS KITTY BEHIND TWICE) Like that. Pandybat.
(TWICE LOUDLY A PANDYBAT CRACKS, THE COFFIN OF THE PIANOLA FLIES OPEN,
THE BALD LITTLE ROUND JACK-IN-THE-BOX HEAD OF FATHER DOLAN SPRINGS UP.)
FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little
schemer. See it in your eye.
(MILD, BENIGN, RECTORIAL, REPROVING, THE HEAD OF DON JOHN CONMEE RISES
FROM THE PIANOLA COFFIN.)
DON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan! Now. I’m sure that Stephen is a very
good little boy!
ZOE: (EXAMINING STEPHEN’S PALM) Woman’s hand.
STEPHEN: (MURMURS) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His
handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.
ZOE: What day were you born?
STEPHEN: Thursday. Today.
ZOE: Thursday’s child has far to go. (SHE TRACES LINES ON HIS HAND) Line
of fate. Influential friends.
FLORRY: (POINTING) Imagination.
ZOE: Mount of the moon. You’ll meet with a ... (SHE PEERS AT HIS HANDS
ABRUPTLY) I won’t tell you what’s not good for you. Or do you want to
know?
BLOOM: (DETACHES HER FINGERS AND OFFERS HIS PALM) More harm than good.
Here. Read mine.
BELLA: Show. (SHE TURNS UP BLOOM’S HAND) I thought so. Knobby knuckles
for the women.
ZOE: (PEERING AT BLOOM’S PALM) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry
money.
BLOOM: Wrong.
ZOE: (QUICKLY) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That
wrong?
(BLACK LIZ, A HUGE ROOSTER HATCHING IN A CHALKED CIRCLE, RISES, STRETCHES
HER WINGS AND CLUCKS.)
BLACK LIZ: Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.
(she Sidles From Her Newlaid Egg and Waddles Off)
BLOOM: (POINTS TO HIS HAND) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut
it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.
ZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.
STEPHEN: See? Moves to one great goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen years ago
he was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled. Twentytwo
years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (HE WINCES) Hurt my hand
somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?
(ZOE WHISPERS TO FLORRY. THEY GIGGLE. BLOOM RELEASES HIS HAND AND WRITES
IDLY ON THE TABLE IN BACKHAND, PENCILLING SLOW CURVES.)
FLORRY: What?
(A HACKNEYCAR, NUMBER THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTYFOUR, WITH A

SIDEWAYS, A RED FLOWER IN HIS MOUTH. LENEHAN IN YACHTSMAN’S CAP AND WHITE
SHOES OFFICIOUSLY DETACHES A LONG HAIR FROM BLAZES BOYLAN’S COAT
SHOULDER.)
LENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a
few quims?
BOYLAN: (SEATED, SMILES) Plucking a turkey.
LENEHAN: A good night’s work.
BOYLAN: (HOLDING UP FOUR THICK BLUNTUNGULATED FINGERS, WINKS) Blazes
Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (HE HOLDS OUT A FOREFINGER) Smell
that.
LENEHAN: (SMELLS GLEEFULLY) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!
ZOE AND FLORRY: (LAUGH TOGETHER) Ha ha ha ha.
BOYLAN: (JUMPS SURELY FROM THE CAR AND CALLS LOUDLY FOR ALL TO HEAR)
Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom dressed yet?
BLOOM: (IN FLUNKEY’S PRUNE PLUSH COAT AND KNEEBREECHES, BUFF STOCKINGS
AND POWDERED WIG) I’m afraid not, sir. The last articles ...
BOYLAN: (TOSSES HIM SIXPENCE) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (HE
HANGS HIS HAT SMARTLY ON A PEG OF BLOOM’S ANTLERED HEAD) Show me in. I
have a little private business with your wife, you understand?
BLOOM: Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.
MARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (SHE PLOPS SPLASHING
OUT OF THE WATER) Raoul darling, come and dry me. I’m in my pelt. Only my
new hat and a carriage sponge.
BOYLAN: (A MERRY TWINKLE IN HIS EYE) Topping!
BELLA: What? What is it?
(zoe Whispers to Her.)
MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I’ll write
to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise
weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and
stamped receipt.
BOYLAN: (clasps himself) Here, I can’t hold this little lot much longer.
(he strides off on stiff cavalry legs)
BELLA: (LAUGHING) Ho ho ho ho.
BOYLAN: (TO BLOOM, OVER HIS SHOULDER) You can apply your eye to the
keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness
the deed and take a snapshot? (HE HOLDS OUT AN OINTMENT JAR) Vaseline,
sir? Orangeflower ...? Lukewarm water ...?
KITTY: (FROM THE SOFA) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.
(FLORRY WHISPERS TO HER. WHISPERING LOVEWORDS MURMUR, LIPLAPPING LOUDLY,
POPPYSMIC PLOPSLOP.)
MINA KENNEDY: (HER EYES UPTURNED) O, it must be like the scent of
geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!
Stuck together! Covered with kisses!
LYDIA DOUCE: (HER MOUTH OPENING) Yumyum. O, he’s carrying her round the
room doing it! Ride a cockhorse. You could hear them in Paris and New
York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

(STEPHEN AND BLOOM GAZE IN THE MIRROR. THE FACE OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
BEARDLESS, APPEARS THERE, RIGID IN FACIAL PARALYSIS, CROWNED BY THE
REFLECTION OF THE REINDEER ANTLERED HATRACK IN THE HALL.)
SHAKESPEARE: (IN DIGNIFIED VENTRILOQUY) ’Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the
vacant mind. (TO BLOOM) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible.
Gaze. (HE CROWS WITH A BLACK CAPON’S LAUGH) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow
chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!

BUCK MULLIGAN: She’s beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the
afflicted mother. (HE UPTURNS HIS EYES) Mercurial Malachi!
THE MOTHER: (WITH THE SUBTLE SMILE OF DEATH’S MADNESS) I was once the
beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.
STEPHEN: (HORRORSTRUCK) Lemur, who are you? No. What bogeyman’s trick is
this?
BUCK MULLIGAN: (SHAKES HIS CURLING CAPBELL) The mockery of it! Kinch
dogsbody killed her bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (TEARS OF MOLTEN
BUTTER FALL FROM HIS EYES ON TO THE SCONE) Our great sweet mother! EPI
OINOPA PONTON.
THE MOTHER: (COMES NEARER, BREATHING UPON HIM SOFTLY HER BREATH OF WETTED
ASHES) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world.
You too. Time will come.
STEPHEN: (CHOKING WITH FRIGHT, REMORSE AND HORROR) They say I killed you,
mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.
THE MOTHER: (A GREEN RILL OF BILE TRICKLING FROM A SIDE OF HER MOUTH) You
sang that song to me. LOVE’S BITTER MYSTERY.
STEPHEN: (EAGERLY) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word
known to all men.
THE MOTHER: Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey
with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the
strangers? Prayer is allpowerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the
Ursuline manual and forty days’ indulgence. Repent, Stephen.
STEPHEN: The ghoul! Hyena!
THE MOTHER: I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that
boiled rice every night after your brainwork. Years and years I loved
you, O, my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.

TOWARDS STEPHEN’S BREAST WITH OUTSTRETCHED FINGER) Beware God’s hand! (A
GREEN CRAB WITH MALIGNANT RED EYES STICKS DEEP ITS GRINNING CLAWS IN
STEPHEN’S HEART.)

OLD)

STEPHEN: AH NON, PAR EXEMPLE! The intellectual imagination! With me all
or not at all. NON SERVIAM!
FLORRY: Give him some cold water. Wait. (SHE RUSHES OUT)
THE MOTHER: (WRINGS HER HANDS SLOWLY, MOANING DESPERATELY) O Sacred Heart
of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O Divine Sacred Heart!
STEPHEN: No! No! No! Break my spirit, all of you, if you can! I’ll bring
you all to heel!
THE MOTHER: (IN THE AGONY OF HER DEATHRATTLE) Have mercy on Stephen,
Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love,
grief and agony on Mount Calvary.

BEATS THE GROUND AND FLIES FROM THE ROOM, PAST THE WHORES AT THE DOOR.)

FROM THE ROOM. THEY TALK EXCITEDLY. BLOOM FOLLOWS, RETURNS.)
THE WHORES: (JAMMED IN THE DOORWAY, POINTING) Down there.
ZOE: (POINTING) There. There’s something up.
BELLA: Who pays for the lamp? (SHE SEIZES BLOOM’S COATTAIL) Here, you
were with him. The lamp’s broken.
BLOOM: (RUSHES TO THE HALL, RUSHES BACK) What lamp, woman?
A WHORE: He tore his coat.
BELLA: (HER EYES HARD WITH ANGER AND CUPIDITY, POINTS) Who’s to pay for
that? Ten shillings. You’re a witness.
BLOOM: (SNATCHES UP STEPHEN’S ASHPLANT) Me? Ten shillings? Haven’t you
lifted enough off him? Didn’t he ...?
BELLA: (LOUDLY) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn’t a brothel. A ten
shilling house.
BLOOM: (HIS HEAD UNDER THE LAMP, PULLS THE CHAIN. PULING, THE GASJET
LIGHTS UP A CRUSHED MAUVE PURPLE SHADE. HE RAISES THE ASHPLANT.) Only the
chimney’s broken. Here is all he ...
BELLA: (SHRINKS BACK AND SCREAMS) Jesus! Don’t!
BLOOM: (WARDING OFF A BLOW) To show you how he hit the paper. There’s not
sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!
FLORRY: (WITH A GLASS OF WATER, ENTERS) Where is he?
BELLA: Do you want me to call the police?
BLOOM: O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he’s a Trinity student.
Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (HE MAKES A
MASONIC SIGN) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don’t
want a scandal.
BELLA: (ANGRILY) Trinity. Coming down here ragging after the boatraces
and paying nothing. Are you my commander here or? Where is he? I’ll
charge him! Disgrace him, I will! (SHE SHOUTS) Zoe! Zoe!
BLOOM: (URGENTLY) And if it were your own son in Oxford? (WARNINGLY) I
know.
BELLA: (ALMOST SPEECHLESS) Who are. Incog!
ZOE: (IN THE DOORWAY) There’s a row on.
BLOOM: What? Where? (HE THROWS A SHILLING ON THE TABLE AND STARTS) That’s
for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air.
(HE HURRIES OUT THROUGH THE HALL. THE WHORES POINT. FLORRY FOLLOWS,
SPILLING WATER FROM HER TILTED TUMBLER. ON THE DOORSTEP ALL THE WHORES
CLUSTERED TALK VOLUBLY, POINTING TO THE RIGHT WHERE THE FOG HAS CLEARED
OFF. FROM THE LEFT ARRIVES A JINGLING HACKNEY CAR. IT SLOWS TO IN FRONT
OF THE HOUSE. BLOOM AT THE HALLDOOR PERCEIVES CORNY KELLEHER WHO IS ABOUT
TO DISMOUNT FROM THE CAR WITH TWO SILENT LECHERS. HE AVERTS HIS FACE.

SILENT LECHERS TURN TO PAY THE JARVEY. ZOE AND KITTY STILL POINT RIGHT.

STEPHEN: (WITH ELABORATE GESTURES, BREATHING DEEPLY AND SLOWLY) You are
my guests. Uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of
Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.
PRIVATE CARR: (TO CISSY CAFFREY) Was he insulting you?
STEPHEN: Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES: No, he didn’t. I seen him. The girl there. He was in Mrs Cohen’s.
What’s up? Soldier and civilian.
CISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to
do–you know, and the young man run up behind me. But I’m faithful to the
man that’s treating me though I’m only a shilling whore.
STEPHEN: (CATCHES SIGHT OF LYNCH’S AND KITTY’S HEADS) Hail, Sisyphus. (HE
POINTS TO HIMSELF AND THE OTHERS) Poetic. Uropoetic.
VOICES: Shes faithfultheman.
CISSY CAFFREY: Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.
PRIVATE COMPTON: He doesn’t half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him
one, Harry.
PRIVATE CARR: (TO CISSY) Was he insulting you while me and him was having
a piss?
LORD TENNYSON: (GENTLEMAN POET IN UNION JACK BLAZER AND CRICKET FLANNELS,
BAREHEADED, FLOWINGBEARDED) Theirs not to reason why.
PRIVATE COMPTON: Biff him, Harry.
STEPHEN: (TO PRIVATE COMPTON) I don’t know your name but you are quite
right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their
shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.
CISSY CAFFREY: (TO THE CROWD) No, I was with the privates.
STEPHEN: (AMIABLY) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every
lady for example ...
PRIVATE CARR: (HIS CAP AWRY, ADVANCES TO STEPHEN) Say, how would it be,
governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?
STEPHEN: (LOOKS UP TO THE SKY) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of
selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. (HE WAVES HIS HAND) Hand hurts
me slightly. ENFIN CE SONT VOS OIGNONS. (TO CISSY CAFFREY) Some trouble
is on here. What is it precisely?
DOLLY GRAY: (FROM HER BALCONY WAVES HER HANDKERCHIEF, GIVING THE SIGN OF
THE HEROINE OF JERICHO) Rahab. Cook’s son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly.
Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.
(the Soldiers Turn Their Swimming Eyes.)
BLOOM: (ELBOWING THROUGH THE CROWD, PLUCKS STEPHEN’S SLEEVE VIGOROUSLY)
Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.
STEPHEN: (TURNS) Eh? (HE DISENGAGES HIMSELF) Why should I not speak to
him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (HE
POINTS HIS FINGER) I’m not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye.
Retaining the perpendicular.
(he Staggers a Pace Back)
BLOOM: (PROPPING HIM) Retain your own.
STEPHEN: (LAUGHS EMPTILY) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have
forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for
life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the tsar
and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (HE TAPS HIS BROW)
But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.
BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said? He’s a professor
out of the college.
CUNTY KATE: I did. I heard that.
BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of
phraseology.
CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite
trenchancy.
PRIVATE CARR: (PULLS HIMSELF FREE AND COMES FORWARD) What’s that you’re
saying about my king?
(EDWARD THE SEVENTH APPEARS IN AN ARCHWAY. HE WARS A WHITE JERSEY ON
WHICH AN IMAGE OF THE SACRED HEART IS STITCHED WITH THE INSIGNIA OF
GARTER AND THISTLE, GOLDEN FLEECE, ELEPHANT OF DENMARK, SKINNER’S AND
PROBYN’S HORSE, LINCOLN’S INN BENCHER AND ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE
ARTILLERY COMPANY OF MASSACHUSETTS. HE SUCKS A RED JUJUBE. HE IS ROBED AS
A GRAND ELECT PERFECT AND SUBLIME MASON WITH TROWEL AND APRON, MARKED
made in Germany. IN HIS LEFT HAND HE HOLDS A PLASTERER’S BUCKET ON WHICH
IS PRINTED Defense d’uriner. A ROAR OF WELCOME GREETS HIM.)
EDWARD THE SEVENTH: (SLOWLY, SOLEMNLY BUT INDISTINCTLY) Peace, perfect
peace. For identification, bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (HE TURNS TO
HIS SUBJECTS) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we
heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a bak.
(HE SHAKES HANDS WITH PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON, STEPHEN, BLOOM AND
LYNCH. GENERAL APPLAUSE. EDWARD THE SEVENTH LIFTS HIS BUCKET GRACIOUSLY
IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT.)
PRIVATE CARR: (TO STEPHEN) Say it again.
STEPHEN: (NERVOUS, FRIENDLY, PULLS HIMSELF UP) I understand your point of
view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of
patent medicines. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the
point. You die for your country. Suppose. (HE PLACES HIS ARM ON PRIVATE
CARR’S SLEEVE)  Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die
for me. Up to the  present it has done so. I didn’t want it to die. Damn
death. Long live life!
EDWARD THE SEVENTH: (LEVITATES OVER HEAPS OF SLAIN, IN THE GARB AND WITH
THE HALO OF JOKING JESUS, A WHITE JUJUBE IN HIS PHOSPHORESCENT FACE)
    My methods are new and are causing surprise.
    To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.
STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! (HE FILLS BACK A PACE) Come somewhere and
we’ll ... What was that girl saying? ...
PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one
into Jerry.
BLOOM: (TO THE PRIVATES, SOFTLY) He doesn’t know what he’s saying. Taken
a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster. I know
him. He’s a gentleman, a poet. It’s all right.
STEPHEN: (NODS, SMILING AND LAUGHING) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and
judge of impostors.
PRIVATE CARR: I don’t give a bugger who he is.
PRIVATE COMPTON: We don’t give a bugger who he is.
STEPHEN: I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

WILD GEESE VOLANT ON HIS HELM, WITH NOBLE INDIGNATION POINTS A MAILED
HAND AGAINST THE PRIVATES) Werf those eykes to footboden, big grand
porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!
BLOOM: (TO STEPHEN) Come home. You’ll get into trouble.
STEPHEN: (SWAYING) I don’t avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.
BIDDY THE CLAP: One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.
THE VIRAGO: Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.
THE BAWD: The red’s as good as the green. And better. Up the soldiers! Up
King Edward!
A ROUGH: (LAUGHS) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.
The Citizen: (with a Huge Emerald Muffler and Shillelagh, Calls)
    May the God above
    Send down a dove
    With teeth as sharp as razors
    To slit the throats
    Of the English dogs
    That hanged our Irish leaders.
THE CROPPY BOY: (THE ROPENOOSE ROUND HIS NECK, GRIPES IN HIS ISSUING
BOWELS WITH BOTH HANDS)
    I bear no hate to a living thing,
    But I love my country beyond the king.

ADVANCES WITH GLADSTONE BAG WHICH HE OPENS) Ladies and gents, cleaver
purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered
the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the
unfortunate female’s throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing
arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent Seddon to the
gallows.
(HE JERKS THE ROPE. THE ASSISTANTS LEAP AT THE VICTIM’S LEGS AND DRAG HIM

awful rebel. Ten shillings a time. As applied to Her Royal Highness. (HE
PLUNGES HIS HEAD INTO THE GAPING BELLY OF THE HANGED AND DRAWS OUT HIS
HEAD AGAIN CLOTTED WITH COILED AND SMOKING ENTRAILS) My painful duty has
now been done. God save the king!
EDWARD THE SEVENTH: (DANCES SLOWLY, SOLEMNLY, RATTLING HIS BUCKET, AND
SINGS WITH SOFT CONTENTMENT)
    On coronation day, on coronation day,
    O, won’t we have a merry time,
    Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
PRIVATE CARR: Here. What are you saying about my king?
STEPHEN: (THROWS UP HIS HANDS) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He
wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some
brutish empire of his. Money I haven’t. (HE SEARCHES HIS POCKETS VAGUELY)
GAVE IT TO SOMEONE.
PRIVATE CARR: Who wants your bleeding money?
STEPHEN: (TRIES TO MOVE OFF) Will someone tell me where I am least likely
to meet these necessary evils? CA SE VOIT AUSSI A PARIS. Not that I ...
But, by Saint Patrick ...!
(THE WOMEN’S HEADS COALESCE. OLD GUMMY GRANNY IN SUGARLOAF HAT APPEARS

BREAST.)
STEPHEN: Aha! I know you, gammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats
her farrow!
OLD GUMMY GRANNY: (ROCKING TO AND FRO) Ireland’s sweetheart, the king of
Spain’s daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them!
(SHE KEENS WITH BANSHEE WOE) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (SHE
WAILS) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?
STEPHEN: How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where’s the third person of
the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.
CISSY CAFFREY: (SHRILL) Stop them from fighting!
A ROUGH: Our men retreated.
PRIVATE CARR: (TUGGING AT HIS BELT) I’ll wring the neck of any fucker
says a word against my fucking king.
BLOOM: (TERRIFIED) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.
The Citizen: Erin Go Bragh!
(MAJOR TWEEDY AND THE CITIZEN EXHIBIT TO EACH OTHER MEDALS, DECORATIONS,
TROPHIES OF WAR, WOUNDS. BOTH SALUTE WITH FIERCE HOSTILITY.)
PRIVATE COMPTON: Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He’s a proboer.
STEPHEN: Did I? When?
BLOOM: (TO THE REDCOATS) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile
troops. Isn’t that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our
monarch.
THE NAVVY: (STAGGERING PAST) O, yes! O God, yes! O, make the kwawr a

(MASSED BANDS BLARE Garryowen AND God save the king.)
CISSY CAFFREY: They’re going to fight. For me!
CUNTY KATE: The brave and the fair.
BIDDY THE CLAP: Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.
CUNTY KATE: (BLUSHING DEEPLY) Nay, madam. The gules doublet and merry
saint George for me!
Stephen:
    The harlot’s cry from street to street
    Shall weave Old Ireland’s windingsheet.
PRIVATE CARR: (LOOSENING HIS BELT, SHOUTS) I’ll wring the neck of any
fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.
BLOOM: (SHAKES CISSY CAFFREY’S SHOULDERS) Speak, you! Are you struck
dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman,
sacred lifegiver!
CISSY CAFFREY: (ALARMED, SEIZES PRIVATE CARR’S SLEEVE) Amn’t I with you?
Amn’t I your girl? Cissy’s your girl. (SHE CRIES) Police!

the cops!
(two Raincaped Watch, Tall, Stand in the Group.)
FIRST WATCH: What’s wrong here?
PRIVATE COMPTON: We were with this lady. And he insulted us. And
assaulted my chum. (THE RETRIEVER BARKS) Who owns the bleeding tyke?
CISSY CAFFREY: (WITH EXPECTATION) Is he bleeding!
A MAN: (RISING FROM HIS KNEES) No. Gone off. He’ll come to all right.
BLOOM: (GLANCES SHARPLY AT THE MAN) Leave him to me. I can easily ...
SECOND WATCH: Who are you? Do you know him?
PRIVATE CARR: (LURCHES TOWARDS THE WATCH) He insulted my lady friend.
BLOOM: (ANGRILY) You hit him without provocation. I’m a witness.
Constable, take his regimental number.
SECOND WATCH: I don’t want your instructions in the discharge of my duty.
PRIVATE COMPTON: (PULLING HIS COMRADE) Here, bugger off Harry. Or
Bennett’ll shove you in the lockup.
PRIVATE CARR: (STAGGERING AS HE IS PULLED AWAY) God fuck old Bennett.
He’s a whitearsed bugger. I don’t give a shit for him.
FIRST WATCH: (TAKES OUT HIS NOTEBOOK) What’s his name?
BLOOM: (PEERING OVER THE CROWD) I just see a car there. If you give me a
hand a second, sergeant ...
FIRST WATCH: Name and address.
(CORNY KELLEKER, WEEPERS ROUND HIS HAT, A DEATH WREATH IN HIS HAND,
APPEARS AMONG THE BYSTANDERS.)
BLOOM: (QUICKLY) O, the very man! (HE WHISPERS) Simon Dedalus’ son. A bit
sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.
SECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher.
CORNY KELLEHER: (TO THE WATCH, WITH DRAWLING EYE) That’s all right. I
know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (HE LAUGHS) Twenty
to one. Do you follow me?
FIRST WATCH: (TURNS TO THE CROWD) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move
on out of that.
(the Crowd Disperses Slowly, Muttering, Down the Lane.)
CORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. That’ll be all right. (HE
LAUGHS, SHAKING HIS HEAD) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse.
What? Eh, what?
FIRST WATCH: (LAUGHS) I suppose so.
CORNY KELLEHER: (NUDGES THE SECOND WATCH) Come and wipe your name off the
slate. (HE LILTS, WAGGING HIS HEAD) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom
tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?
SECOND WATCH: (GENIALLY) Ah, sure we were too.
CORNY KELLEHER: (WINKING) Boys will be boys. I’ve a car round there.
SECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.
CORNY KELLEHER: I’ll see to that.
BLOOM: (SHAKES HANDS WITH BOTH OF THE WATCH IN TURN) Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you. (HE MUMBLES CONFIDENTIALLY) We don’t want any
scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly respected citizen.
Just a little wild oats, you understand.
FIRST WATCH: O. I understand, sir.
SECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir.
FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to report
it at the station.
BLOOM: (NODS RAPIDLY) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.
SECOND WATCH: It’s our duty.
CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.
THE WATCH: (SALUTING TOGETHER) Night, gentlemen. (THEY MOVE OFF WITH SLOW
HEAVY TREAD)
BLOOM: (BLOWS) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car? ...
CORNY KELLEHER: (LAUGHS, POINTING HIS THUMB OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER TO
THE CAR BROUGHT UP AGAINST THE SCAFFOLDING) Two commercials that were
standing fizz in Jammet’s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid
on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the jolly
girls. So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.
BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to ...
CORNY KELLEHER: (LAUGHS) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots.
No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (HE
LAUGHS AGAIN AND LEERS WITH LACKLUSTRE EYE) Thanks be to God we have it
in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!
BLOOM: (TRIES TO LAUGH) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just
visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor
fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and
I was just making my way home ...
(the Horse Neighs.)
THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we
left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen’s and I told him to pull up and got
off to see. (HE LAUGHS) Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I give him
a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?
BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
(STEPHEN, PRONE, BREATHES TO THE STARS. CORNY KELLEHER, ASQUINT, DRAWLS
AT THE HORSE. BLOOM, IN GLOOM, LOOMS DOWN.)
CORNY KELLEHER: (SCRATCHES HIS NAPE) Sandycove! (HE BENDS DOWN AND CALLS
TO STEPHEN) Eh! (HE CALLS AGAIN) Eh! He’s covered with shavings anyhow.
Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.
BLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I’ll
shove along. (HE LAUGHS) I’ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the
dead. Safe home!
THE HORSE: (NEIGHS) Hohohohohome.
BLOOM: Good night. I’ll just wait and take him along in a few ...
(CORNY KELLEHER RETURNS TO THE OUTSIDE CAR AND MOUNTS IT. THE HORSE
HARNESS JINGLES.)
CORNY KELLEHER: (FROM THE CAR, STANDING) Night.
BLOOM: Night.
(THE JARVEY CHUCKS THE REINS AND RAISES HIS WHIP ENCOURAGINGLY. THE CAR
AND HORSE BACK SLOWLY, AWKWARDLY, AND TURN. CORNY KELLEHER ON THE
SIDESEAT SWAYS HIS HEAD TO AND FRO IN SIGN OF MIRTH AT BLOOM’S PLIGHT.
THE JARVEY JOINS IN THE MUTE PANTOMIMIC MERRIMENT NODDING FROM THE
FARTHER SEAT. BLOOM SHAKES HIS HEAD IN MUTE MIRTHFUL REPLY. WITH THUMB
AND PALM CORNY KELLEHER REASSURES THAT THE TWO BOBBIES WILL ALLOW THE
SLEEP TO CONTINUE FOR WHAT ELSE IS TO BE DONE. WITH A SLOW NOD BLOOM
CONVEYS HIS GRATITUDE AS THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT STEPHEN NEEDS. THE CAR
JINGLES TOORALOOM ROUND THE CORNER OF THE TOORALOOM LANE. CORNY KELLEHER
AGAIN REASSURALOOMS WITH HIS HAND. BLOOM WITH HIS HAND ASSURALOOMS CORNY
KELLEHER THAT HE IS REASSURALOOMTAY. THE TINKLING HOOFS AND JINGLING
HARNESS GROW FAINTER WITH THEIR TOORALOOLOO LOOLOO LAY. BLOOM, HOLDING IN
HIS HAND STEPHEN’S HAT, FESTOONED WITH SHAVINGS, AND ASHPLANT, STANDS
IRRESOLUTE. THEN HE BENDS TO HIM AND SHAKES HIM BY THE SHOULDER.)
BLOOM: Eh! Ho! (THERE IS NO ANSWER; HE BENDS AGAIN) Mr Dedalus! (THERE IS
NO ANSWER) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (HE BENDS AGAIN AND
HESITATING, BRINGS HIS MOUTH NEAR THE FACE OF THE PROSTRATE FORM)
Stephen! (THERE IS NO ANSWER. HE CALLS AGAIN.) Stephen!
STEPHEN: (GROANS) Who? Black panther. Vampire. (HE SIGHS AND STRETCHES
HIMSELF, THEN MURMURS THICKLY WITH PROLONGED VOWELS)
    Who ... drive... Fergus now
    And pierce ... wood’s woven shade? ...
(he Turns On His Left Side, Sighing, Doubling Himself Together.)
BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (HE BENDS AGAIN AND UNDOES THE
BUTTONS OF STEPHEN’S WAISTCOAT) To breathe. (HE BRUSHES THE WOODSHAVINGS
FROM STEPHEN’S CLOTHES WITH LIGHT HAND AND FINGERS) One pound seven. Not
hurt anyhow. (HE LISTENS) What?
Stephen: (murmurs)
    ... shadows ... the woods
    ... white breast... dim sea.
(HE STRETCHES OUT HIS ARMS, SIGHS AGAIN AND CURLS HIS BODY. BLOOM,
HOLDING THE HAT AND ASHPLANT, STANDS ERECT. A DOG BARKS IN THE DISTANCE.
BLOOM TIGHTENS AND LOOSENS HIS GRIP ON THE ASHPLANT. HE LOOKS DOWN ON
STEPHEN’S FACE AND FORM.)
BLOOM: (COMMUNES WITH THE NIGHT) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In
the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A
girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. (HE MURMURS) ... swear that
I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or
arts ... (HE MURMURS) ... in the rough sands of the sea ... a cabletow’s
length from the shore ... where the tide ebbs ... and flows ...
(SILENT, THOUGHTFUL, ALERT HE STANDS ON GUARD, HIS FINGERS AT HIS LIPS IN
THE ATTITUDE OF SECRET MASTER. AGAINST THE DARK WALL A FIGURE APPEARS
SLOWLY, A FAIRY BOY OF ELEVEN, A CHANGELING, KIDNAPPED, DRESSED IN AN
ETON SUIT WITH GLASS SHOES AND A LITTLE BRONZE HELMET, HOLDING A BOOK IN
HIS HAND. HE READS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT INAUDIBLY, SMILING, KISSING THE
PAGE.)
BLOOM: (WONDERSTRUCK, CALLS INAUDIBLY) Rudy!
RUDY: (GAZES, UNSEEING, INTO BLOOM’S EYES AND GOES ON READING, KISSING,
SMILING. HE HAS A DELICATE MAUVE FACE. ON HIS SUIT HE HAS DIAMOND AND
RUBY BUTTONS. IN HIS FREE LEFT HAND HE HOLDS A SLIM IVORY CANE WITH A
VIOLET BOWKNOT. A WHITE LAMBKIN PEEPS OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET.)
