In the fall of 2002, Jesse Jordan of Oceanside, New York, enrolled as a freshman 
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York. His major at RPI was 
information technology. Though he is not a programmer, in October Jesse decided 
to begin to tinker with search engine technology that was available on the RPI 
network.
RPI is one of America’s foremost technological research institutions. It offers 
degrees in fields ranging from architecture and engineering to information 
sciences. More than 65 percent of its five thousand undergraduates finished in 
the top 10 percent of their high school class. The school is thus a perfect mix 
of talent and experience to imagine and then build, a generation for the network 
age.
RPI’s computer network links students, faculty, and administration to one 
another. It also links RPI to the Internet. Not everything available on the RPI 
network is available on the Internet. But the network is designed to enable 
students to get access to the Internet, as well as more intimate access to other 
members of the RPI community.
Search engines are a measure of a network’s intimacy. Google brought the 
Internet much closer to all of us by fantastically improving the quality of 
search on the network. Specialty search engines can do this even better. The 
idea of intranet search engines, search engines that search within the network 
of a particular institution, is to provide users of that institution with better 
access to material from that institution. Businesses do this all the time, 
enabling employees to have access to material that people outside the business 
can’t get. Universities do it as well.
These engines are enabled by the network technology itself. Microsoft, for 
example, has a network file system that makes it very easy for search engines 
tuned to that network to query the system for information about the publicly 
(within that network) available content. Jesse’s search engine was built to take 
advantage of this technology. It used Microsoft’s network file system to build 
an index of all the files available within the RPI network.
Jesse’s wasn’t the first search engine built for the RPI network. Indeed, his 
engine was a simple modification of engines that others had built. His single 
most important improvement over those engines was to fix a bug within the 
Microsoft file-sharing system that could cause a user’s computer to crash. With 
the engines that existed before, if you tried to access a file through a Windows 
browser that was on a computer that was off-line, your computer could crash. 
Jesse modified the system a bit to fix that problem, by adding a button that a 
user could click to see if the machine holding the file was still on-line.
Jesse’s engine went on-line in late October. Over the following six months, he 
continued to tweak it to improve its functionality. By March, the system was 
functioning quite well. Jesse had more than one million files in his directory, 
including every type of content that might be on users’ computers.
Thus the index his search engine produced included pictures, which students 
could use to put on their own Web sites; copies of notes or research; copies of 
information pamphlets; movie clips that students might have created; university 
brochuresbasically anything that users of the RPI network made available in a 
public folder of their computer.
But the index also included music files. In fact, one quarter of the files that 
Jesse’s search engine listed were music files. But that means, of course, that 
three quarters were not, andso that this point is absolutely clearJesse did 
nothing to induce people to put music files in their public folders. He did 
nothing to target the search engine to these files. He was a kid tinkering with 
a Google-like technology at a university where he was studying information 
science, and hence, tinkering was the aim. Unlike Google, or Microsoft, for that 
matter, he made no money from this tinkering; he was not connected to any 
business that would make any money from this experiment. He was a kid tinkering 
with technology in an environment where tinkering with technology was precisely 
what he was supposed to do.
On April 3, 2003, Jesse was contacted by the dean of students at RPI. The dean 
informed Jesse that the Recording Industry Association of America, the RIAA, 
would be filing a lawsuit against him and three other students whom he didn’t 
even know, two of them at other universities. A few hours later, Jesse was 
served with papers from the suit. As he read these papers and watched the news 
reports about them, he was increasingly astonished.
It was absurd, he told me. I don’t think I did anything wrong. ... I don’t 
think there’s anything wrong with the search engine that I ran or ... what I had 
done to it. I mean, I hadn’t modified it in any way that promoted or enhanced 
the work of pirates. I just modified the search engine in a way that would make 
it easier to useagain, a search engine, which Jesse had not himself built, 
using the Windows file-sharing system, which Jesse had not himself built, to 
enable members of the RPI community to get access to content, which Jesse had 
not himself created or posted, and the vast majority of which had nothing to do 
with music.
But the RIAA branded Jesse a pirate. They claimed he operated a network and had 
therefore willfully violated copyright laws. They demanded that he pay them 
the damages for his wrong. For cases of willful infringement, the Copyright 
Act specifies something lawyers call statutory damages. These damages permit a 
copyright owner to claim $150,000 per infringement. As the RIAA alleged more 
than one hundred specific copyright infringements, they therefore demanded that 
Jesse pay them at least $15,000,000.
Similar lawsuits were brought against three other students: one other student at 
RPI, one at Michigan Technical University, and one at Princeton. Their 
situations were similar to Jesse’s. Though each case was different in detail, 
the bottom line in each was exactly the same: huge demands for damages that 
the RIAA claimed it was entitled to. If you added up the claims, these four 
lawsuits were asking courts in the United States to award the plaintiffs close 
to $100 billionsix times the total profit of the film industry in 2001. [1]
Jesse called his parents. They were supportive but a bit frightened. An uncle 
was a lawyer. He began negotiations with the RIAA. They demanded to know how 
much money Jesse had. Jesse had saved $12,000 from summer jobs and other 
employment. They demanded $12,000 to dismiss the case.
The RIAA wanted Jesse to admit to doing something wrong. He refused. They wanted 
him to agree to an injunction that would essentially make it impossible for him 
to work in many fields of technology for the rest of his life. He refused. They 
made him understand that this process of being sued was not going to be 
pleasant. (As Jesse’s father recounted to me, the chief lawyer on the case, Matt 
Oppenheimer, told Jesse, You don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like 
me.) And throughout, the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it 
took every penny Jesse had saved.
Jesse’s family was outraged at these claims. They wanted to fight. But Jesse’s 
uncle worked to educate the family about the nature of the American legal 
system. Jesse could fight the RIAA. He might even win. But the cost of fighting 
a lawsuit like this, Jesse was told, would be at least $250,000. If he won, he 
would not recover that money. If he won, he would have a piece of paper saying 
he had won, and a piece of paper saying he and his family were bankrupt.
So Jesse faced a mafia-like choice: $250,000 and a chance at winning, or $12,000 
and a settlement.
The recording industry insists this is a matter of law and morality. Let’s put 
the law aside for a moment and think about the morality. Where is the morality 
in a lawsuit like this? What is the virtue in scapegoatism? The RIAA is an 
extraordinarily powerful lobby. The president of the RIAA is reported to make 
more than $1 million a year. Artists, on the other hand, are not well paid. The 
average recording artist makes $45,900. [2] There are plenty of ways for the 
RIAA to affect and direct policy. So where is the morality in taking money from 
a student for running a search engine? [3]
On June 23, Jesse wired his savings to the lawyer working for the RIAA. The case 
against him was then dismissed. And with this, this kid who had tinkered a 
computer into a $15 million lawsuit became an activist:
I was definitely not an activist [before]. I never really meant to be an 
activist. ... [But] I’ve been pushed into this. In no way did I ever foresee 
anything like this, but I think it’s just completely absurd what the RIAA has 
done.
Jesse’s parents betray a certain pride in their reluctant activist. As his 
father told me, Jesse considers himself very conservative, and so do I. ... 
He’s not a tree hugger. . . . I think it’s bizarre that they would pick on him. 
But he wants to let people know that they’re sending the wrong message. And he 
wants to correct the record.
