There are more than 35 million people with the AIDS virus worldwide. Twenty-five 
million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. Seventeen million have already died. 
Seventeen million Africans is proportional percentage-wise to seven million 
Americans. More importantly, it is seventeen million Africans.
There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs to slow its progression. These 
antiretroviral therapies are still experimental, but they have already had a 
dramatic effect. In the United States, AIDS patients who regularly take a 
cocktail of these drugs increase their life expectancy by ten to twenty years. 
For some, the drugs make the disease almost invisible.
These drugs are expensive. When they were first introduced in the United States, 
they cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per person per year. Today, some cost 
$25,000 per year. At these prices, of course, no African nation can afford the 
drugs for the vast majority of its population: $15,000 is thirty times the per 
capita gross national product of Zimbabwe. At these prices, the drugs are 
totally unavailable. [1]
These prices are not high because the ingredients of the drugs are expensive. 
These prices are high because the drugs are protected by patents. The drug 
companies that produced these life-saving mixes enjoy at least a twenty-year 
monopoly for their inventions. They use that monopoly power to extract the most 
they can from the market. That power is in turn used to keep the prices high.
There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug patents. I am not. 
Indeed, of all the areas of research that might be supported by patents, drug 
research is, in my view, the clearest case where patents are needed. The patent 
gives the drug company some assurance that if it is successful in inventing a 
new drug to treat a disease, it will be able to earn back its investment and 
more. This is socially an extremely valuable incentive. I am the last person who 
would argue that the law should abolish it, at least without other changes.
But it is one thing to support patents, even drug patents. It is another thing 
to determine how best to deal with a crisis. And as African leaders began to 
recognize the devastation that AIDS was bringing, they started looking for ways 
to import HIV treatments at costs significantly below the market price.
In 1997, South Africa tried one tack. It passed a law to allow the importation 
of patented medicines that had been produced or sold in another nation’s market 
with the consent of the patent owner. For example, if the drug was sold in 
India, it could be imported into Africa from India. This is called parallel 
importation, and it is generally permitted under international trade law and is 
specifically permitted within the European Union. [2]
However, the United States government opposed the bill. Indeed, more than 
opposed. As the International Intellectual Property Association characterized 
it, The U.S. government pressured South Africa ... not to permit compulsory 
licensing or parallel imports. [3] Through the Office of the United States 
Trade Representative, the government asked South Africa to change the lawand to 
add pressure to that request, in 1998, the USTR listed South Africa for possible 
trade sanctions. That same year, more than forty pharmaceutical companies began 
proceedings in the South African courts to challenge the govern-ment’s actions. 
The United States was then joined by other governments from the EU. Their claim, 
and the claim of the pharmaceutical companies, was that South Africa was 
violating its obligations under international law by discriminating against a 
particular kind of patentpharmaceutical patents. The demand of these 
governments, with the United States in the lead, was that South Africa respect 
these patents as it respects any other patent, regardless of any effect on the 
treatment of AIDS within South Africa. [4]
We should place the intervention by the United States in context. No doubt 
patents are not the most important reason that Africans don’t have access to 
drugs. Poverty and the total absence of an effective health care infrastructure 
matter more. But whether patents are the most important reason or not, the price 
of drugs has an effect on their demand, and patents affect price. And so, 
whether massive or marginal, there was an effect from our government’s 
intervention to stop the flow of medications into Africa.
By stopping the flow of HIV treatment into Africa, the United States government 
was not saving drugs for United States citizens. This is not like wheat (if they 
eat it, we can’t); instead, the flow that the United States intervened to stop 
was, in effect, a flow of knowledge: information about how to take chemicals 
that exist within Africa, and turn those chemicals into drugs that would save 15 
to 30 million lives.
Nor was the intervention by the United States going to protect the profits of 
United States drug companiesat least, not substantially. It was not as if these 
countries were in the position to buy the drugs for the prices the drug 
companies were charging. Again, the Africans are wildly too poor to afford these 
drugs at the offered prices. Stopping the parallel import of these drugs would 
not substantially increase the sales by U.S. companies.
Instead, the argument in favor of restricting this flow of information, which 
was needed to save the lives of millions, was an argument about the sanctity of 
property. [5] It was because intellectual property would be violated that 
these drugs should not flow into Africa. It was a principle about the importance 
of intellectual property that led these government actors to intervene against 
the South African response to AIDS.
Now just step back for a moment. There will be a time thirty years from now when 
our children look back at us and ask, how could we have let this happen? How 
could we allow a policy to be pursued whose direct cost would be to speed the 
death of 15 to 30 million Africans, and whose only real benefit would be to 
uphold the sanctity of an idea? What possible justification could there ever 
be for a policy that results in so many deaths? What exactly is the insanity 
that would allow so many to die for such an abstraction?
Some blame the drug companies. I don’t. They are corporations. Their managers 
are ordered by law to make money for the corporation. They push a certain patent 
policy not because of ideals, but because it is the policy that makes them the 
most money. And it only makes them the most money because of a certain 
corruption within our political systema corruption the drug companies are 
certainly not responsible for.
The corruption is our own politicians’ failure of integrity. For the drug 
companies would lovethey say, and I believe themto sell their drugs as cheaply 
as they can to countries in Africa and elsewhere. There are issues they’d have 
to resolve to make sure the drugs didn’t get back into the United States, but 
those are mere problems of technology. They could be overcome.
A different problem, however, could not be overcome. This is the fear of the 
grandstanding politician who would call the presidents of the drug companies 
before a Senate or House hearing, and ask, How is it you can sell this HIV drug 
in Africa for only $1 a pill, but the same drug would cost an American $1,500? 
Because there is no sound bite” answer to that question, its effect would be to 
induce regulation of prices in America. The drug companies thus avoid this 
spiral by avoiding the first step. They reinforce the idea that property should 
be sacred. They adopt a rational strategy in an irrational context, with the 
unintended consequence that perhaps millions die. And that rational strategy 
thus becomes framed in terms of this idealthe sanctity of an idea called 
intellectual property.
So when the common sense of your child confronts you, what will you say? When 
the common sense of a generation finally revolts against what we have done, how 
will we justify what we have done? What is the argument?
A sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support the patent system 
without having to reach everyone everywhere in exactly the same way. Just as a 
sensible copyright policy could endorse and strongly support a copyright system 
without having to regulate the spread of culture perfectly and forever, a 
sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support a patent system 
without having to block the spread of drugs to a country not rich enough to 
afford market prices in any case. A sensible policy, in other words, could be a 
balanced policy. For most of our history, both copyright and patent policies 
were balanced in just this sense.
But we as a culture have lost this sense of balance. We have lost the critical 
eye that helps us see the difference between truth and extremism. A certain 
property fundamentalism, having no connection to our tradition, now reigns in 
this culturebizarrely, and with consequences more grave to the spread of ideas 
and culture than almost any other single policy decision that we as a democracy 
will make.
A simple idea blinds us, and under the cover of darkness, much happens that most 
of us would reject if any of us looked. So uncritically do we accept the idea of 
property in ideas that we don’t even notice how monstrous it is to deny ideas to 
a people who are dying without them. So uncritically do we accept the idea of 
property in culture that we don’t even question when the control of that 
property removes our ability, as a people, to develop our culture 
democratically. Blindness becomes our common sense. And the challenge for anyone 
who would reclaim the right to cultivate our culture is to find a way to make 
this common sense open its eyes.
So far, common sense sleeps. There is no revolt. Common sense does not yet see 
what there could be to revolt about. The extremism that now dominates this 
debate fits with ideas that seem natural, and that fit is reinforced by the RCAs 
of our day. They wage a frantic war to fight piracy, and devastate a culture 
for creativity. They defend the idea of creative property, while transforming 
real creators into modern-day sharecroppers. They are insulted by the idea that 
rights should be balanced, even though each of the major players in this content 
war was itself a beneficiary of a more balanced ideal. The hypocrisy reeks. Yet 
in a city like Washington, hypocrisy is not even noticed. Powerful lobbies, 
complex issues, and MTV attention spans produce the perfect storm for free 
culture.
In August 2003, a fight broke out in the United States about a decision by the 
World Intellectual Property Organization to cancel a meeting. [6] At the request 
of a wide range of interests, WIPO had decided to hold a meeting to discuss 
open and collaborative projects to create public goods. These are projects 
that have been successful in producing public goods without relying exclusively 
upon a proprietary use of intellectual property. Examples include the Internet 
and the World Wide Web, both of which were developed on the basis of protocols 
in the public domain. It included an emerging trend to support open academic 
journals, including the Public Library of Science project that I describe in the 
Afterword. It included a project to develop single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), which are thought to have great significance in biomedical research. 
(That nonprofit project comprised a consortium of the Wellcome Trust and 
pharmaceutical and technological companies, including Amersham Biosciences, 
AstraZeneca, Aventis, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Hoffmann-La Roche, Glaxo-
SmithKline, IBM, Motorola, Novartis, Pfizer, and Searle.) It included the Global 
Positioning System, which Ronald Reagan set free in the early 1980s. And it 
included open source and free software.
The aim of the meeting was to consider this wide range of projects from one 
common perspective: that none of these projects relied upon intellectual 
property extremism. Instead, in all of them, intellectual property was balanced 
by agreements to keep access open or to impose limitations on the way in which 
proprietary claims might be used.
From the perspective of this book, then, the conference was ideal. [7] The 
projects within its scope included both commercial and noncommercial work. They 
primarily involved science, but from many perspectives. And WIPO was an ideal 
venue for this discussion, since WIPO is the preeminent international body 
dealing with intellectual property issues.
Indeed, I was once publicly scolded for not recognizing this fact about WIPO. In 
February 2003, I delivered a keynote address to a preparatory conference for the 
World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). At a press conference before the 
address, I was asked what I would say. I responded that I would be talking a 
little about the importance of balance in intellectual property for the 
development of an information society. The moderator for the event then promptly 
interrupted to inform me and the assembled reporters that no question about 
intellectual property would be discussed by WSIS, since those questions were the 
exclusive domain of WIPO. In the talk that I had prepared, I had actually made 
the issue of intellectual property relatively minor. But after this astonishing 
statement, I made intellectual property the sole focus of my talk. There was no 
way to talk about an Information Society unless one also talked about the 
range of information and culture that would be free. My talk did not make my 
immoderate moderator very happy. And she was no doubt correct that the scope of 
intellectual property protections was ordinarily the stuff of WIPO. But in my 
view, there couldn’t be too much of a conversation about how much intellectual 
property is needed, since in my view, the very idea of balance in intellectual 
property had been lost.
So whether or not WSIS can discuss balance in intellectual property, I had 
thought it was taken for granted that WIPO could and should. And thus the 
meeting about open and collaborative projects to create public goods seemed 
perfectly appropriate within the WIPO agenda.
But there is one project within that list that is highly controversial, at least 
among lobbyists. That project is open source and free software. Microsoft in 
particular is wary of discussion of the subject. From its perspective, a 
conference to discuss open source and free software would be like a conference 
to discuss Apple’s operating system. Both open source and free software compete 
with Microsoft’s software. And internationally, many governments have begun to 
explore requirements that they use open source or free software, rather than 
proprietary software, for their own internal uses.
I don’t mean to enter that debate here. It is important only to make clear that 
the distinction is not between commercial and noncommercial software. There are 
many important companies that depend fundamentally upon open source and free 
software, IBM being the most prominent. IBM is increasingly shifting its focus 
to the GNU/Linux operating system, the most famous bit of free softwareand 
IBM is emphatically a commercial entity. Thus, to support open source and free 
software is not to oppose commercial entities. It is, instead, to support a 
mode of software development that is different from Microsoft’s. [8]
More important for our purposes, to support open source and free software is 
not to oppose copyright. Open source and free software” is not software in the 
public domain. Instead, like Microsoft’s software, the copyright owners of free 
and open source software insist quite strongly that the terms of their software 
license be respected by adopters of free and open source software. The terms of 
that license are no doubt different from the terms of a proprietary software 
license. Free software licensed under the General Public License (GPL), for 
example, requires that the source code for the software be made available by 
anyone who modifies and redistributes the software. But that requirement is 
effective only if copyright governs software. If copyright did not govern 
software, then free software could not impose the same kind of requirements on 
its adopters. It thus depends upon copyright law just as Microsoft does.
It is therefore understandable that as a proprietary software developer, 
Microsoft would oppose this WIPO meeting, and understandable that it would use 
its lobbyists to get the United States government to oppose it, as well. And 
indeed, that is just what was reported to have happened. According to Jonathan 
Krim of the Washington Post, Microsoft’s lobbyists succeeded in getting the 
United States government to veto the meeting. [9] And without U.S. backing, the 
meeting was canceled.
I don’t blame Microsoft for doing what it can to advance its own interests, 
consistent with the law. And lobbying governments is plainly consistent with the 
law. There was nothing surprising about its lobbying here, and nothing terribly 
surprising about the most powerful software producer in the United States having 
succeeded in its lobbying efforts.
What was surprising was the United States government’s reason for opposing the 
meeting. Again, as reported by Krim, Lois Boland, acting director of 
international relations for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, explained that 
open-source software runs counter to the mission of WIPO, which is to promote 
intellectual-property rights. She is quoted as saying, To hold a meeting which 
has as its purpose to disclaim or waive such rights seems to us to be contrary 
to the goals of WIPO.
These statements are astonishing on a number of levels.
First, they are just flat wrong. As I described, most open source and free 
software relies fundamentally upon the intellectual property right called 
copyright. Without it, restrictions imposed by those licenses wouldn’t work. 
Thus, to say it runs counter to the mission of promoting intellectual property 
rights reveals an extraordinary gap in under- standingthe sort of mistake that 
is excusable in a first-year law student, but an embarrassment from a high 
government official dealing with intellectual property issues.
Second, who ever said that WIPO’s exclusive aim was to promote” intellectual 
property maximally? As I had been scolded at the preparatory conference of WSIS, 
WIPO is to consider not only how best to protect intellectual property, but also 
what the best balance of intellectual property is. As every economist and lawyer 
knows, the hard question in intellectual property law is to find that balance. 
But that there should be limits is, I had thought, uncontested. One wants to ask 
Ms. Boland, are generic drugs (drugs based on drugs whose patent has expired) 
contrary to the WIPO mission? Does the public domain weaken intellectual 
property? Would it have been better if the protocols of the Internet had been 
patented?
Third, even if one believed that the purpose of WIPO was to maximize 
intellectual property rights, in our tradition, intellectual property rights are 
held by individuals and corporations. They get to decide what to do with those 
rights because, again, they are their rights. If they want to waive or 
disclaim their rights, that is, within our tradition, totally appropriate. 
When Bill Gates gives away more than $20 billion to do good in the world, that 
is not inconsistent with the objectives of the property system. That is, on the 
contrary, just what a property system is supposed to be about: giving 
individuals the right to decide what to do with their property.
When Ms. Boland says that there is something wrong with a meeting which has as 
its purpose to disclaim or waive such rights, she’s saying that WIPO has an 
interest in interfering with the choices of the individuals who own intellectual 
property rights. That somehow, WIPO’s objective should be to stop an individual 
from waiving or dis-claiming an intellectual property right. That the 
interest of WIPO is not just that intellectual property rights be maximized, but 
that they also should be exercised in the most extreme and restrictive way 
possible.
There is a history of just such a property system that is well known in the 
Anglo-American tradition. It is called feudalism. Under feudalism, not only 
was property held by a relatively small number of individuals and entities. And 
not only were the rights that ran with that property powerful and extensive. But 
the feudal system had a strong interest in assuring that property holders within 
that system not weaken feudalism by liberating people or property within their 
control to the free market. Feudalism depended upon maximum control and 
concentration. It fought any freedom that might interfere with that control.
As Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite relate, this is precisely the choice we are 
now making about intellectual property. [10] We will have an information 
society. That much is certain. Our only choice now is whether that information 
society will be free or feudal. The trend is toward the feudal.
When this battle broke, I blogged it. A spirited debate within the comment 
section ensued. Ms. Boland had a number of supporters who tried to show why her 
comments made sense. But there was one comment that was particularly depressing 
for me. An anonymous poster wrote,
George, you misunderstand Lessig: He’s only talking about the world as it 
should be (the goal of WIPO, and the goal of any government, should be to 
promote the right balance of intellectual- property rights, not simply to 
promote intellectual property rights”), not as it is. If we were talking about 
the world as it is, then of course Boland didn’t say anything wrong. But in the 
world as Lessig would have it, then of course she did. Always pay attention to 
the distinction between Lessig’s world and ours.
I missed the irony the first time I read it. I read it quickly and thought the 
poster was supporting the idea that seeking balance was what our government 
should be doing. (Of course, my criticism of Ms. Boland was not about whether 
she was seeking balance or not; my criticism was that her comments betrayed a 
first-year law student’s mistake. I have no illusion about the extremism of our 
government, whether Republican or Democrat. My only illusion apparently is about 
whether our government should speak the truth or not.)
Obviously, however, the poster was not supporting that idea. Instead, the poster 
was ridiculing the very idea that in the real world, the goal of a government 
should be to promote the right balance of intellectual property. That was 
obviously silly to him. And it obviously betrayed, he believed, my own silly 
utopianism. Typical for an academic, the poster might well have continued.
I understand criticism of academic utopianism. I think utopianism is silly, too, 
and I’d be the first to poke fun at the absurdly unrealistic ideals of academics 
throughout history (and not just in our own country’s history).
But when it has become silly to suppose that the role of our government should 
be to seek balance, then count me with the silly, for that means that this has 
become quite serious indeed. If it should be obvious to everyone that the 
government does not seek balance, that the government is simply the tool of the 
most powerful lobbyists, that the idea of holding the government to a different 
standard is absurd, that the idea of demanding of the government that it speak 
truth and not lies is just naïve, then who have we, the most powerful democracy 
in the world, become?
It might be crazy to expect a high government official to speak the truth. It 
might be crazy to believe that government policy will be something more than the 
handmaiden of the most powerful interests. It might be crazy to argue that we 
should preserve a tradition that has been part of our tradition for most of our 
historyfree culture.
If this is crazy, then let there be more crazies. Soon.
There are moments of hope in this struggle. And moments that surprise. When the 
FCC was considering relaxing ownership rules, which would thereby further 
increase the concentration in media ownership, an extraordinary bipartisan 
coalition formed to fight this change. For perhaps the first time in history, 
interests as diverse as the NRA, the ACLU, Moveon.org, William Safire, Ted 
Turner, and CodePink Women for Peace organized to oppose this change in FCC 
policy. An astonishing 700,000 letters were sent to the FCC, demanding more 
hearings and a different result.
This activism did not stop the FCC, but soon after, a broad coalition in the 
Senate voted to reverse the FCC decision. The hostile hearings leading up to 
that vote revealed just how powerful this movement had become. There was no 
substantial support for the FCC’s decision, and there was broad and sustained 
support for fighting further concentration in the media.
But even this movement misses an important piece of the puzzle. Largeness as 
such is not bad. Freedom is not threatened just because some become very rich, 
or because there are only a handful of big players. The poor quality of Big Macs 
or Quarter Pounders does not mean that you can’t get a good hamburger from 
somewhere else.
The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentration, but instead 
from the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the change in copyright, 
produces. It is not just that there are a few powerful companies that control an 
ever expanding slice of the media. It is that this concentration can call upon 
an equally bloated range of rightsproperty rights of a historically extreme 
formthat makes their bigness bad.
It is therefore significant that so many would rally to demand competition and 
increased diversity. Still, if the rally is understood as being about bigness 
alone, it is not terribly surprising. We Americans have a long history of 
fighting big, wisely or not. That we could be motivated to fight big again 
is not something new.
It would be something new, and something very important, if an equal number 
could be rallied to fight the increasing extremism built within the idea of 
intellectual property. Not because balance is alien to our tradition; indeed, 
as I’ve argued, balance is our tradition. But because the muscle to think 
critically about the scope of anything called property is not well exercised 
within this tradition anymore.
If we were Achilles, this would be our heel. This would be the place of our 
tragedy.
As I write these final words, the news is filled with stories about the RIAA 
lawsuits against almost three hundred individuals. [11] Eminem has just been 
sued for sampling someone else’s music. [12] The story about Bob Dylan 
stealing from a Japanese author has just finished making the rounds. [13] An 
insider from Hollywoodwho insists he must remain anonymousreports an amazing 
conversation with these studio guys. They’ve got extraordinary [old] content 
that they’d love to use but can’t because they can’t begin to clear the rights. 
They’ve got scores of kids who could do amazing things with the content, but it 
would take scores of lawyers to clean it first. Congressmen are talking about 
deputizing computer viruses to bring down computers thought to violate the law. 
Universities are threatening expulsion for kids who use a computer to share 
content.
Yet on the other side of the Atlantic, the BBC has just announced that it will 
build a Creative Archive, from which British citizens can download BBC 
content, and rip, mix, and burn it. [14] And in Brazil, the culture minister, 
Gilberto Gil, himself a folk hero of Brazilian music, has joined with Creative 
Commons to release content and free licenses in that Latin American country. 
[15]
I’ve told a dark story. The truth is more mixed. A technology has given us a new 
freedom. Slowly, some begin to understand that this freedom need not mean 
anarchy. We can carry a free culture into the twenty-first century, without 
artists losing and without the potential of digital technology being destroyed. 
It will take some thought, and more importantly, it will take some will to 
transform the RCAs of our day into the Causbys.
Common sense must revolt. It must act to free culture. Soon, if this potential 
is ever to be realized.
