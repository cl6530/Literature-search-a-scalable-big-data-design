ONE day there was a traveller in the woods in California, in the 
dry season, when the Trades were blowing strong.  He had ridden a 
long way, and he was tired and hungry, and dismounted from his 
horse to smoke a pipe.  But when he felt in his pocket he found but 
two matches.  He struck the first, and it would not light.
“Here is a pretty state of things!” said the traveller.  “Dying for 
a smoke; only one match left; and that certain to miss fire!  Was 
there ever a creature so unfortunate?  And yet,” thought the 
traveller, “suppose I light this match, and smoke my pipe, and 
shake out the dottle here in the grass - the grass might catch on 
fire, for it is dry like tinder; and while I snatch out the flames 
in front, they might evade and run behind me, and seize upon yon 
bush of poison oak; before I could reach it, that would have blazed 
up; over the bush I see a pine tree hung with moss; that too would 
fly in fire upon the instant to its topmost bough; and the flame of 
that long torch - how would the trade wind take and brandish that 
through the inflammable forest!  I hear this dell roar in a moment 
with the joint voice of wind and fire, I see myself gallop for my 
soul, and the flying conflagration chase and outflank me through 
the hills; I see this pleasant forest burn for days, and the cattle 
roasted, and the springs dried up, and the farmer ruined, and his 
children cast upon the world.  What a world hangs upon this 
moment!”
With that he struck the match, and it missed fire.
“Thank God!” said the traveller, and put his pipe in his pocket.
