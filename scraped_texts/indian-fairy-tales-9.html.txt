Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees
and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun,
who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red
cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing
with the Wazir’s son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal’s garden, which
was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees.
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat
them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and
write.
One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to
his father, “Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt.” His
father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else
they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting
all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds.
The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a
daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and
black hair.
One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father’s kingdom,
as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told
her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this
was Khuda’s command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the
angel’s visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to
her story. From that time she began repeating, “Majnun, Majnun; I want
Majnun,” and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food
she kept saying, “Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.” Her father used to
get quite vexed with her. “Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this
Majnun?” he would say.
“He is the man I am to marry,” said Laili. “Khuda has ordered me to
marry no one but Majnun.” And she was half mad.
Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana
country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to
eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying,
“Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.” The prince heard her, and turned
round. “Who is calling me?” he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and
the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said
to herself, “I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am
to marry.” And she went home to her father and said, “Father, I wish to
marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the
Prince Majnun I am to marry.”
“Very well, you shall have him for your husband,” said Munsuk Raja. “We
will ask him to-morrow.” Laili consented to wait, although she was very
impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that
night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would
not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to
her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle,
till she got farther and farther away from her own country. All the
time she kept saying, “Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;” and so she
wandered about for twelve years.
At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir–he was really an angel,
but she did not know this–who asked her, “Why do you always say,
’Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun’?” She answered, “I am the daughter of
the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell
me where his kingdom is.”
“I think you will never get there,” said the fakir, “for it is very far
from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it.” But Laili
said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. “Well,” said the
fakir, “when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish,
a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun’s country,
or you will never reach it.”
She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river. There
was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she
got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its
stomach. All the time she kept saying, “Majnun, Majnun.” At this the
Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he
could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and
perched on his back, and said “Caw, caw.” “Oh, Mr. Crow,” said the poor
fish “do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise.”
“Very well,” said the crow, “open your mouth wide, and I’ll fly down
and see.”
So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up
again very quickly. “You have a Rakshas in your stomach,” said the
crow, and he flew away.
This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he
came to Prince Majnun’s country. There he stopped. And a jackal came
down to the river to drink. “Oh, jackal,” said the Rohu “do tell me
what I have inside me.”
“How can I tell?” said the jackal. “I cannot see unless I go inside
you.” So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his
throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and
saying, “You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don’t run away
quickly, I am afraid it will eat me.” So off he ran. After the jackal
came an enormous snake. “Oh,” says the fish, “do tell me what I have in
my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, ’Majnun, Majnun;
I want Majnun.’”
The snake said, “Open your mouth wide, and I’ll go down and see what it
is.” The snake went down: when he returned he said, “You have a Rakshas
in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out
of you.” “If you do that, I shall die,” said the Rohu. “Oh, no,” said
the snake, “you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make
you quite well again.” So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife
and cut him open, and out jumped Laili.
She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle,
and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no
longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his
back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and
she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun’s court-house, where King
Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, “Majnun, Majnun; I
want Majnun,” and they asked her what she wanted. “I want King Majnun,"
she said.
So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, “An old woman outside says
she wants you.” “I cannot leave this place,” said he; “send her in
here.” They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted. “I
want to marry you,” she answered. “Twenty-four years ago you came to my
father the Phalana Raja’s country, and I wanted to marry you then; but
you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered
about all these years looking for you.” Prince Majnun said, “Very
good.”
“Pray to Khuda,” said Laili, “to make us both young again, and then we
shall be married.” So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to
him, “Touch Laili’s clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are
on fire, she and you will become young again.” When he touched Laili’s
clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again. And there
were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana
country to see her father and mother.
Now Laili’s father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that
they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating,
“Laili, Laili, Laili.” When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to
Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the
father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then
they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince
Majnum and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years,
and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time
with him. They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country
to country to eat the air and amuse themselves.
One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, “Let us go through this jungle."
“No, no,” said Laili; “if we go through this jungle, some harm will
happen to me.” But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle. And
as they were going through it, Khuda thought, “I should like to know
how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she
died? And would he marry another wife? I will see.” So he sent one of
his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went
up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell
to the ground a heap of ashes.
Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili
turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his
father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a
great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again
into his father’s beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal
wished his son to marry again. “I will only have Laili for my wife; I
will not marry any other woman,” said Prince Majnun.
“How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to
you,” said the father. “Then I’ll not have any wife at all,” said
Prince Majnun.
Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her
a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken
her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and
water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so
Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili
had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and
teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she
had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the
jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, “Majnun,
Majnun; I want Majnun.”
At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her,
said to Khuda, “Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the
jungle crying, crying for ever, ’Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,’ and
eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun.” “Well,"
said Khuda, “you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to
Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is
afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next
day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human
shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and
lets her sleep in his bed.”
So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King
Dantal’s garden. “Now,” he said, “it is Khuda’s command that you stay
here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may
show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of
you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a
little white dog.” He then told her what she must do as a little dog to
regain her human form.
Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince
Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was
now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as
old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who
had been made quite young again when he married Laili.
As Prince Majnun and the Wazir’s son walked in the garden, they
gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit
the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy
eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he
turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir’s son.
“Oh, look, look!” he cried, “see what is following you; it is a Rakshas
or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us.” Laili looked at him
beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness;
but this only frightened Majnun the more. “It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"
he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir’s son; and as
they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King
Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the
garden that had come to eat them.
“What nonsense,” said his father. “Fancy two grown men being so
frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it
would not have eaten you.” Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun
had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was
speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible
old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very
silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk
in the garden any more.
The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape
she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of
her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out
hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her
with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the
little dog slept in his bed.
But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay
the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and
now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some
such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out,
“What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!” Poor Laili
answered, “Don’t you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry
you. Don’t you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I
begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen
to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became
a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here,
after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and
now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall
not be a little dog any more.” Majnun, however, said “How can I marry
an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a
Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,” and he was in great terror.
In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the
prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. “An old
woman! an old woman! always an old woman!” said his father. “You do
nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so
easily frightened?” However, when he saw that his son was really in
great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back
at night, he advised him to say to her, “I will marry you if you can
make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as
you are?”
That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in
place of the dog, crying “Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have
loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father’s kingdom
a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we
should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and
for long, long years I followed you.”
“Well,” said Majnun, “if you can make yourself a young girl again, I
will marry you.”
Laili said, “Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl
again. In two days’ time you must go into the garden, and there you
will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your
room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it
when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite
alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at
all on.” In the morning Laili took her little dog’s form, and
disappeared in the garden.
Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the
old woman had bidden him. In two days’ time he and the Wazir’s son
walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit.
“Oh!” said the Prince, “I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."
Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till
he had told his father, who said, “That must be the fruit; go and
gather it.” So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and
he said to his father, “Come with me to my room while I open it; I am
afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that
will eat me.”
“No,” said King Dantal; “remember, Laili will be naked; you must go
alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit,
for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a
loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to
eat you.”
Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he
shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and
far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme
beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor.
Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari
(for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal,
and said to him sadly, “Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will
he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen
me so many, many times.”
King Dantal answered, “It is because you are so beautiful. You are far,
far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy
directly.” Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun’s face
and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again.
Then Laili said, “Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?”
“Oh!” said Prince Majnun, “I see you are Laili come back to me, but
your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I
saw them.” Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the
drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played
on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the
servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs.
After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife
went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a
groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden.
“We must go into that garden and see it,” said Majnun.
“No, no,” said Laili; “it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very
wicked man.” But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili
could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was
looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and
she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her.
So she said to Majnun, “Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad
man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you
to seize me.”
“What nonsense,” said Majnun. “I believe he is a very good Raja.
Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away.”
“Well,” said Laili, “it is better that you should be killed than I, for
if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life
again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed.” Now Chumman Basa
had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince
Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and
cut off the prince’s head at one blow.
Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her
she said, “Why did you kill my husband?”
“Because I want to take you,” he answered.
“You cannot,” said Laili.
“Yes, I can,” said the Raja.
“Take me, then,” said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and
put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put
her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her
hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it
was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and
her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa’s head at one touch.
Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun’s dead
body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from
the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like
healing medicine. Then she put Majnun’s head on his shoulders, and
smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and
said, “What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had
slept for years!” Then he got up and saw the Raja’s dead body by
Laili’s horse.
“What’s that?” said Majnun.
“That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he
would.”
“Who killed him?” asked Majnun.
“I did,” answered Laili, “and it was I who brought you to life.”
“Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,” said Majnun.
“No,” said Laili, “for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you
harm.” But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to
bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, “Jump up on the
horse, then, and go far away with the groom.”
“What will you do,” said Majnun, “if I leave you? I cannot leave you.”
“I will take care of myself,” said Laili; “but this man is so wicked,
he may kill you again if you are near him.” So Majnun got up on the
horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili.
Then she set the wicked Raja’s head straight on his shoulders, and she
squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out
of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed,
and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and
she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch
her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode
so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal’s palace.
There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified
and angry. “How lucky for you that you have such a wife,” he said. “Why
did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."
Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son’s safety, and
gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He
loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a
splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about
it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of
servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants
to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go
out of them, nor Laili; “for,” said King Dantal, “Laili is so
beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away.”
