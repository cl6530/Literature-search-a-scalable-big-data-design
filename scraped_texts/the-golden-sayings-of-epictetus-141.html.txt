Art thou then free? a man may say. So help me heaven, I long
and pray for freedom! But I cannot look my masters boldly in the
face; I still value the poor body; I still set much store on its
preservation whole and sound.
But I can point thee out a free man, that thou mayest be no

because he was of free parentage (for that, indeed, was not the

handle whereby slavery might lay hold upon him, nor was it
possible for any to approach and take hold of him to enslave him.
All things sat loose upon him—all things were to him attached by
but slender ties. Hadst thou seized upon his possessions, he
would rather have let them go than have followed thee for
them—aye, had it been even a limb, or mayhap his whole body; and
in like manner, relatives, friends, and country. For he knew
whence they came—from whose hands and on what terms he had
received them. His true forefathers, the Gods, his true Country,
he never would have abandoned; nor would he have yielded to any
man in obedience and submission to the one nor in cheerfully
dying for the other. For he was ever mindful that everything that
comes to pass has its source and origin there; being indeed
brought about for the weal of that his true Country, and directed
by Him in whose governance it is.
