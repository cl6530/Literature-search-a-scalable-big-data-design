So here’s the picture: You’re standing at the side of the road. Your car is on 
fire. You are angry and upset because in part you helped start the fire. Now you 
don’t know how to put it out. Next to you is a bucket, filled with gasoline. 
Obviously, gasoline won’t put the fire out.
As you ponder the mess, someone else comes along. In a panic, she grabs the 
bucket. Before you have a chance to tell her to stopor before she understands 
just why she should stopthe bucket is in the air. The gasoline is about to hit 
the blazing car. And the fire that gasoline will ignite is about to ignite 
everything around.
A war about copyright rages all aroundand we’re all focusing on the wrong 
thing. No doubt, current technologies threaten existing businesses. No doubt 
they may threaten artists. But technologies change. The industry and 
technologists have plenty of ways to use technology to protect themselves 
against the current threats of the Internet. This is a fire that if let alone 
would burn itself out.
Yet policy makers are not willing to leave this fire to itself. Primed with 
plenty of lobbyists’ money, they are keen to intervene to eliminate the problem 
they perceive. But the problem they perceive is not the real threat this culture 
faces. For while we watch this small fire in the corner, there is a massive 
change in the way culture is made that is happening all around.
Somehow we have to find a way to turn attention to this more important and 
fundamental issue. Somehow we have to find a way to avoid pouring gasoline onto 
this fire.
We have not found that way yet. Instead, we seem trapped in a simpler, binary 
view. However much many people push to frame this debate more broadly, it is the 
simple, binary view that remains. We rubberneck to look at the fire when we 
should be keeping our eyes on the road.
This challenge has been my life these last few years. It has also been my 
failure. In the two chapters that follow, I describe one small brace of efforts, 
so far failed, to find a way to refocus this debate. We must understand these 
failures if we’re to understand what success will require.
