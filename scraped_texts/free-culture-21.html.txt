I divide this map into two parts: that which anyone can do now, and that which 
requires the help of lawmakers. If there is one lesson that we can draw from the 
history of remaking common sense, it is that it requires remaking how many 
people think about the very same issue.

significant number of parents, teachers, librarians, creators, authors, 
musicians, filmmakers, scientistsall to tell this story in their own words, and 
to tell their neighbors why this battle is so important.
Once this movement has its effect in the streets, it has some hope of having an 
effect in Washington. We are still a democracy. What people think matters. Not
