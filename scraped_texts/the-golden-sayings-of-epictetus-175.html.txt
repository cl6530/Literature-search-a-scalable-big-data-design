Never call yourself a Philosopher nor talk much among the
unlearned about Principles, but do that which follows from them.

philosophers, and he would conduct them thither himselfâ€”so well
did he bear being overlooked. Accordingly if any talk concerning
principles should arise among the unlearned, be you for the most

you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have
begun the work.
