One day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and aunts
Thunder and Lightning. Their mother (one of the most distant Stars you
see far up in the sky) waited alone for her children’s return.
Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish. They enjoyed the great
feast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving any
of it to take home to their mother–but the gentle Moon did not forget
her. Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a small
portion under one of her beautiful long finger-nails, that Star might
also have a share in the treat.
On their return, their mother, who had kept watch for them all night
long with her little bright eye, said, “Well, children, what have you
brought home for me?” Then Sun (who was eldest) said, “I have brought
nothing home for you. I went out to enjoy myself with my friends–not
to fetch a dinner for my mother!” And Wind said, “Neither have I
brought anything home for you, mother. You could hardly expect me to
bring a collection of good things for you, when I merely went out for
my own pleasure.” But Moon said, “Mother, fetch a plate, see what I
have brought you.” And shaking her hands she showered down such a
choice dinner as never was seen before.
Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, “Because you went out to amuse
yourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, without
any thought of your mother at home–you shall be cursed. Henceforth,
your rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that they
touch. And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear.”
(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)
Then she turned to Wind and said, “You also who forgot your mother in
the midst of your selfish pleasures–hear your doom. You shall always
blow in the hot dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all living
things. And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time.”
(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.)
But to Moon she said, “Daughter, because you remembered your mother,
and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth you
shall be ever cool, and calm, and bright. No noxious glare shall
accompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you ’blessed."’
(And that is why the moon’s light is so soft, and cool, and beautiful
even to this day.)
