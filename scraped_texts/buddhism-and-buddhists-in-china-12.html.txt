The student should read and inwardly digest the booklet of K. J.
Saunders
He should follow the directions given in Appendix One of that book, This
procedure is important because the Hînayâna Buddhism and the life of
Buddha are the background of Buddhism in China.
Then he may take Hackmann’s Buddhism as a Religion
(No. 15). This will give a general orientation. This may be followed
with R. F. Johnston’s Buddhist China (No.
20). Along with this he may read Suzuki’s
Awakening of Faith (No. 32), and also his
Outlines of Mahâyanâ Buddhism (No. 33). McGovern’s
Introduction to Mahâyanâ Buddhism (No. 23) will
illuminate the philosophical background of Buddhism, and Eliot’s
Hinduism and Buddhism (No. 13) will add historical
perspective.
The translation of Mahdydna Sutras by Beal and in the
Sacred Books of the East will give him some of the sources for the
doctrines held in China. He may begin as the Buddhist missionaries did
with the sutra of the Forty-two sections and then take up the Diamond
Sutra, and then completing the sutras in Vol. 59 and the Catena of
Buddhist Scriptures.
For the study of the ethical side he will find De Groot’s Le Code
du Mahâyâna en Chine very helpful. For the study of the sects
Eliot, Vol. III, pp. 303-320 Northern Buddhism (No. 14) will
be helpful.
In all his study he will find Eitel’s Handbook of Chinese
Buddhism (No. 12) indispensable. He must, however, make a
Chinese index in order to be able to use the book.
Contact with monks will be helpful and is quite necessary in order to
appreciate the human problems of the work.
