Wilhelm, what is the world to our hearts without love? What is
a magic-lantern without light? You have but to kindle the flame
within, and the brightest figures shine on the white wall; and,
if love only show us fleeting shadows, we are yet happy, when,
like mere children, we behold them, and are transported with the
splendid phantoms. I have not been able to see Charlotte to-day.
I was prevented by company from which I could not disengage myself.
What was to be done? I sent my servant to her house, that I might
at least see somebody to-day who had been near her. Oh, the
impatience with which I waited for his return! the joy with which
I welcomed him! I should certainly have caught him in my arms,
and kissed him, if I had not been ashamed.
It is said that the Bonona stone, when placed in the sun, attracts
the rays, and for a time appears luminous in the dark. So was it
with me and this servant. The idea that Charlotte’s eyes had dwelt
on his countenance, his cheek, his very apparel, endeared them all
inestimably to me, so that at the moment I would not have parted
from him for a thousand crowns. His presence made me so happy!
Beware of laughing at me, Wilhelm. Can that be a delusion which
makes us happy?
