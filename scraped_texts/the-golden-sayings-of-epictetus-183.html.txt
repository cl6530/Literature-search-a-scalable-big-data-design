Favorinus(20) tells us how Epictetus would also say that there
were two faults far graver and fouler than any others—inability
to bear, and inability to forbear, when we neither patiently bear
the blows that must be borne, nor abstain from the things and the
pleasures we ought to abstain from. “So,” he went on, “if a man
will only have these two words at heart, and heed them carefully
by ruling and watching over himself, he will for the most part
fall into no sin, and his life will be tranquil and serene.” He
meant the words  Avexou kai apexou—"Bear and Forbear.”
(20) A Roman orator and sophist.
