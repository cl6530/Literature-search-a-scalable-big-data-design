“That,” said Epictetus, “is for you to consider, not for me.
You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at

And when Florus inquired, ’But why do not you appear?’ he
answered, ’Because I do not even consider the question.’ For the

reckon up the value of external things, is not far from
forgetting what manner of man he is. Why, what is it that you
ask me? Is death preferable, or life? I reply, Life. Pain or
pleasure? I reply, Pleasure.”
“Well, but if I do not act, I shall lose my head.”
“Then go and act! But for my part I will not act.”
“Why?”

which make up the texture of the doublet. You should aim at being
like men in general—just as your thread has no ambition either
to be anything distinguished compared with the other threads. But
