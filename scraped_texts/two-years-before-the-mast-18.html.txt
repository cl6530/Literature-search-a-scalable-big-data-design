For several days the captain seemed very much out of humor.
Nothing went right, or fast enough for him.  He quarrelled with
the cook, and threatened to flog him for throwing wood on deck;
and had a dispute with the mate about reeving a Spanish burton;
the mate saying that he was right, and had been taught how to do
it by a man who was a sailor!  This, the captain took in dudgeon,
and they were at sword’s points at once.  But his displeasure was
chiefly turned against a large, heavy-moulded fellow from the
Middle States, who was called Sam.  This man hesitated in his speech,
and was rather slow in his motions, but was a pretty good sailor,
and always seemed to do his best; but the captain took a dislike
to him, thought he was surly, and lazy; and “if you once give a
dog a bad name"–as the sailor-phrase is–"he may as well jump
overboard.” The captain found fault with everything this man did,
and hazed him for dropping a marline-spike from the main-yard,
where he was at work.  This, of course, was an accident, but it
was set down against him.  The captain was on board all day Friday,
and everything went on hard and disagreeably.  “The more you drive
a man, the less he will do,” was as true with us as with any
other people.  We worked late Friday night, and were turned-to
early Saturday morning.  About ten o’clock the captain ordered
our new officer, Russell, who by this time had become thoroughly
disliked by all the crew, to get the gig ready to take him ashore.
John, the Swede, was sitting in the boat alongside, and Russell
and myself were standing by the main hatchway, waiting for the
captain, who was down in the hold, where the crew were at work,
when we heard his voice raised in violent dispute with somebody,
whether it was with the mate, or one of the crew, I could not
tell; and then came blows and scuffling.  I ran to the side and
beckoned to John, who came up, and we leaned down the hatchway;
and though we could see no one, yet we knew that the captain had
the advantage, for his voice was loud and clear–
“You see your condition! You see your condition! Will you ever
give me any more of your jaw?”  No answer; and then came
wrestling and heaving, as though the man was trying to turn him.
“You may as well keep still, for I have got you,” said the captain.
Then came the question, “Will you ever give me any more of your jaw?”
“I never gave you any, sir,” said Sam; for it was his voice that
we heard, though low and half choked.
“That’s not what I ask you.  Will you ever be impudent to me again?”
“I never have been, sir,” said Sam.
“Answer my question, or I’ll make a spread eagle of you! I’ll
flog you, by G–d.”
“I’m no negro slave,” said Sam.
“Then I’ll make you one,” said the captain; and he came to the 
hatchway, and sprang on deck, threw off his coat, and rolling
up his sleeves, called out to the mate–"Seize that man up, Mr.
A––-!  Seize him up!  Make a spread eagle of him!  I’ll teach
you all who is master aboard!”
The crew and officers followed the captain up the hatchway,
and after repeated orders the mate laid hold of Sam, who made
no resistance, and carried him to the gangway.
“What are you going to flog that man for, sir?” said John, the
Swede, to the captain.
Upon hearing this, the captain turned upon him, but knowing
him to be quick and resolute, he ordered the steward to bring the
irons, and calling upon Russell to help him, went up to John.
“Let me alone,” said John.  “I’m willing to be put in irons.  You
need not use any force;” and putting out his hands, the captain
slipped the irons on, and sent him aft to the quarter-deck.  Sam by
this time was seized up, as it is called, that is, placed against the
shrouds, with his wrists made fast to the shrouds, his jacket off,
and his back exposed.  The captain stood on the break of the deck,
a few feet from him, and a little raised, so as to have a good swing
at him, and held in his hand the bight of a thick, strong rope.
The officers stood round, and the crew grouped together in the waist.
All these preparations made me feel sick and almost faint, angry
and excited as I was.  A man–a human being, made in God’s likeness–
fastened up and flogged like a beast!  A man, too, whom I had lived
with and eaten with for months, and knew almost as well as a brother.
The first and almost uncontrollable impulse was resistance.  But what
was to be done?  The time for it had gone by.  The two best men were
fast, and there were only two beside myself, and a small boy of
ten or twelve years of age.  And then there were (beside the
captain) three officers, steward, agent and clerk.  But beside
the numbers, what is there for sailors to do? If they resist, it is
mutiny; and if they succeed, and take the vessel, it is piracy.
If they ever yield again, their punishment must come; and if they
do not yield, they are pirates for life.  If a sailor resist his
commander, he resists the law, and piracy or submission are his
only alternatives.  Bad as it was, it must be borne.  It is what
a sailor ships for.  Swinging the rope over his head, and bending
his body so as to give it full force, the captain brought it down
upon the poor fellow’s back.  Once, twice–six times.  “Will you
ever give me any more of your jaw?”  The man writhed with pain,
but said not a word.  Three times more.  This was too much, and he
muttered something which I could not hear; this brought as many
more as the man could stand; when the captain ordered him to be
cut down, and to go forward.
“Now for you,” said the captain, making up to John and taking
his irons off.  As soon as he was loose, he ran forward to the
forecastle.  “Bring that man aft,” shouted the captain.  The second
mate, who had been a shipmate of John’s, stood still in the waist,
and the mate walked slowly forward; but our third officer, anxious
to show his zeal, sprang forward over the windlass, and laid hold
of John; but he soon threw him from him.  At this moment I would
have given worlds for the power to help the poor fellow; but it
was all in vain.  The captain stood on the quarter-deck, bare-headed,
his eyes flashing with rage, and his face as red as blood, swinging
the rope, and calling out to his officers, “Drag him aft!–Lay hold
of him!  I’ll sweeten him!” etc., etc.  The mate now went forward
and told John quietly to go aft; and he, seeing resistance in vain,
threw the blackguard third mate from him; said he would go aft
of himself; that they should not drag him; and went up to the
gangway and held out his hands; but as soon as the captain began
to make him fast, the indignity was too much, and he began to
resist; but the mate and Russell holding him, he was soon seized
up.  When he was made fast, he turned to the captain, who stood
turning up his sleeves and getting ready for the blow, and asked
him what he was to be flogged for.  “Have I ever refused my duty,
sir?  Have you ever known me to hang back, or to be insolent, or
not to know my work?”
“No,” said the captain, “it is not that that I flog you for; I flog
you for your interference–for asking questions.”
“Can’t a man ask a question here without being flogged?”
“No,” shouted the captain; “nobody shall open his mouth aboard
this vessel, but myself;” and began laying the blows upon his back,
swinging half round between each blow, to give it full effect.
As he went on, his passion increased, and he danced about the deck,
calling out as he swung the rope,–"If you want to know what I
flog you for, I’ll tell you.  It’s because I like to do it!–because
I like to do it!–It suits me!  That’s what I do it for!”
The man writhed under the pain, until he could endure it no
longer, when he called out, with an exclamation more common
among foreigners than with us–"Oh, Jesus Christ!  Oh, Jesus
Christ!”
“Don’t call on Jesus Christ,” shouted the captain; “he can’t help
you.  Call on Captain T––-, he’s the man!  He can help you!
Jesus Christ can’t help you now!”
At these words, which I never shall forget, my blood ran cold.
I could look on no longer.  Disgusted, sick, and horror-struck,
I turned away and leaned over the rail, and looked down into the
water.  A few rapid thoughts of my own situation, and of the
prospect of future revenge, crossed my mind; but the falling of the
blows and the cries of the man called me back at once.  At length
they ceased, and turning round, I found that the mate, at a signal
from the captain had cut him down.  Almost doubled up with pain,
the man walked slowly forward, and went down into the forecastle.
Every one else stood still at his post, while the captain, swelling
with rage and with the importance of his achievement, walked the
quarter-deck, and at each turn, as he came forward, calling out to
us,–"You see your condition!  You see where I’ve got you all, and
you know what to expect!"–"You’ve been mistaken in me–you didn’t 
know what I was!  Now you know what I am!"–"I’ll make you toe the
mark, every soul of you, or I’ll flog you all, fore and aft, from the
boy, up!"–"You’ve got a driver over you!  Yes, a slave-driver–
a negro-driver! I’ll see who’ll tell me he isn’t a negro slave!"
With this and the like matter, equally calculated to quiet us, and to
allay any apprehensions of future trouble, he entertained us for
about ten minutes, when he went below.  Soon after, John came aft,
with his bare back covered with stripes and wales in every direction,
and dreadfully swollen, and asked the steward to ask the captain to
let him have some salve, or balsam, to put upon it.  “No,” said
the captain, who heard him from below; “tell him to put his shirt
on; that’s the best thing for him; and pull me ashore in the boat.
Nobody is going to lay-up on board this vessel.”  He then called to
Mr. Russell to take those men and two others in the boat, and pull
him ashore.  I went for one.  The two men could hardly bend their
backs, and the captain called to them to “give way,” “give way!” but
finding they did their best, he let them alone.  The agent was in
the stern sheets, but during the whole pull–a league or more–not
a word was spoken.  We landed; the captain, agent, and officer went
up to the house, and left us with the boat.  I, and the man with me,
staid near the boat, while John and Sam walked slowly away, and sat
down on the rocks.  They talked some time together, but at length
separated, each sitting alone.  I had some fears of John.  He was
a foreigner, and violently tempered, and under suffering; and he
had his knife with him, and the captain was to come down alone
to the boat.  But nothing happened; and we went quietly on board.
The captain was probably armed, and if either of them had lifted a
hand against him, they would have had nothing before them but flight,
and starvation in the woods of California, or capture by the soldiers
and Indian blood-hounds, whom the offer of twenty dollars would
have set upon them.
After the day’s work was done, we went down into the forecastle,
and ate our plain supper; but not a word was spoken.  It was
Saturday night; but there was no song–no “sweethearts and wives."
A gloom was over everything.  The two men lay in their berths,
groaning with pain, and we all turned in, but for myself, not to
sleep.  A sound coming now and then from the berths of the two
men showed that they were awake, as awake they must have been,
for they could hardly lie in one posture a moment; the dim,
swinging lamp of the forecastle shed its light over the dark hole
in which we lived; and many and various reflections and purposes
coursed through my mind.  I thought of our situation, living under a
tyranny; of the character of the country we were in; of the length
of the voyage, and of the uncertainty attending our return to
America; and then, if we should return, of the prospect of obtaining
justice and satisfaction for these poor men; and vowed that if God
should ever give me the means, I would do something to redress the
grievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings,
of whom I then was one.
The next day was Sunday.  We worked as usual, washing decks, etc.,
until breakfast-time.  After breakfast, we pulled the captain
ashore, and finding some hides there which had been brought down
the night before, he ordered me to stay ashore and watch them,
saying that the boat would come again before night.  They left me,
and I spent a quiet day on the hill, eating dinner with the three
men at the little house.  Unfortunately, they had no books, and
after talking with them and walking about, I began to grow tired
of doing nothing.  The little brig, the home of so much hardship
and suffering, lay in the offing, almost as far as one could see;
and the only other thing which broke the surface of the great bay
was a small, desolate-looking island, steep and conical, of a clayey
soil, and without the sign of vegetable life upon it; yet which had
a peculiar and melancholy interest to me, for on the top of it were
buried the remains of an Englishman, the commander of a small merchant
brig, who died while lying in this port.  It was always a solemn and
interesting spot to me.  There it stood, desolate, and in the midst
of desolation; and there were the remains of one who died and was
buried alone and friendless.  Had it been a common burying-place,
it would have been nothing.  The single body corresponded well with
the solitary character of everything around.  It was the only thing
in California from which I could ever extract anything like poetry.
Then, too, the man died far from home; without a friend near him;
by poison, it was suspected, and no one to inquire into it; and
without proper funeral rites; the mate, (as I was told,) glad to
have him out of the way, hurrying him up the hill and into the ground,
without a word or a prayer.
I looked anxiously for a boat, during the latter part of the
afternoon, but none came; until toward sundown, when I saw a
speck on the water, and as it drew near, I found it was the
gig, with the captain. The hides, then, were not to go off.
The captain came up the hill, with a man, bringing my monkey
jacket and a blanket.  He looked pretty black, but inquired
whether I had enough to eat; told me to make a house out of
the hides, and keep myself warm, as I should have to sleep
there among them, and to keep good watch over them.  I got
a moment to speak to the man who brought my jacket.
“How do things go aboard?” said I.
“Bad enough,” said he; “hard work and not a kind word spoken.”
“What,” said I, “have you been at work all day?”
“Yes! no more Sunday for us.  Everything has been moved in the
hold, from stem to stern, and from the waterways to the keelson.”
I went up to the house to supper.  We had frijoles, (the perpetual
food of the Californians, but which, when well cooked, are the best
bean in the world,) coffee made of burnt wheat, and hard bread.
After our meal, the three men sat down by the light of a tallow
candle, with a pack of greasy Spanish cards, to the favorite game
of “treinta uno,” a sort of Spanish “everlasting.” I left them and
went out to take up my bivouack among the hides.  It was now dark;
the vessel was hidden from sight, and except the three men in the
house, there was not a living soul within a league.  The coati
(a wild animal of a nature and appearance between that of the fox
and the wolf) set up their sharp, quick bark, and two owls, at the
end of two distant points running out into the bay, on different
sides of the hills where I lay, kept up their alternate, dismal notes.
I had heard the sound before at night, but did not know what it was,
until one of the men, who came down to look at my quarters, told
me it was the owl.  Mellowed by the distance, and heard alone, at
night, I thought it was the most melancholy, boding sound I had
ever heard.  Through nearly all the night they kept it up, answering
one another slowly, at regular intervals.  This was relieved by the
noisy coati, some of which came quite near to my quarters, and
were not very pleasant neighbors.  The next morning, before sunrise,
the long-boat came ashore, and the hides were taken off.
We lay at San Pedro about a week, engaged in taking off hides
and in other labors, which had now become our regular duties.
I spent one more day on the hill, watching a quantity of hides
and goods, and this time succeeded in finding a part of a volume
of Scott’s Pirate, in a corner of the house; but it failed me at a
most interesting moment, and I betook myself to my acquaintances on
shore, and from them learned a good deal about the customs of the
country, the harbors, etc.  This, they told me, was a worse harbor
than Santa Barbara, for south-easters; the bearing of the headland
being a point and a half more to windward, and it being so shallow
that the sea broke often as far out as where we lay at anchor.
The gale from which we slipped at Santa Barbara, had been so bad a
one here, that the whole bay, for a league out, was filled with the
foam of the breakers, and seas actually broke over the Dead Man’s
island.  The Lagoda was lying there, and slipped at the first alarm,
and in such haste that she was obliged to leave her launch behind her
at anchor.  The little boat rode it out for several hours, pitching at
her anchor, and standing with her stern up almost perpendicularly.
The men told me that they watched her till towards night, when
she snapped her cable and drove up over the breakers, high and
dry upon the beach.
On board the Pilgrim, everything went on regularly, each one 
trying to get along as smoothly as possible; but the comfort of
the voyage was evidently at an end.  “That is a long lane which
has no turning"–-"Every dog must have his day, and mine will
come by-and-by"–and the like proverbs, were occasionally quoted;
but no one spoke of any probable end to the voyage, or of Boston,
or anything of the kind; or if he did, it was only to draw out the
perpetual, surly reply from his shipmate–"Boston, is it? You may
thank your stars if you ever see that place.  You had better have
your back sheathed, and your head coppered, and your feet shod,
and make out your log for California for life!” or else something of
this kind–"Before you get to Boston the hides will wear the hair
off your head, and you’ll take up all your wages in clothes, and
won’t have enough left to buy a wig with!”
The flogging was seldom if ever alluded to by us, in the forecastle.
If any one was inclined to talk about it, the others, with a delicacy
which I hardly expected to find among them, always stopped him,
or turned the subject.  But the behavior of the two men who were
flogged toward one another showed a delicacy and a sense of honor,
which would have been worthy of admiration in the highest walks of
life.  Sam knew that the other had suffered solely on his account,
and in all his complaints, he said that if he alone had been flogged,
it would have been nothing; but that he never could see that man
without thinking what had been the means of bringing that disgrace
upon him; and John never, by word or deed, let anything escape him
to remind the other that it was by interfering to save his shipmate,
that he had suffered.
Having got all our spare room filled with hides, we hove up our anchor
and made sail for San Diego.  In no operation can the disposition of
a crew be discovered better than in getting under weigh.
Where things are “done with a will,” every one is like a cat aloft:
sails are loosed in an instant; each one lays out his strength on
his handspike, and the windlass goes briskly round with the loud
cry of “Yo heave ho! Heave and pawl! Heave hearty ho!”  But with us,
at this time, it was all dragging work.  No one went aloft beyond
his ordinary gait, and the chain came slowly in over the windlass.
The mate, between the knight-heads, exhausted all his official
rhetoric, in calls of “Heave with a will!"–"Heave hearty, men!–
heave hearty!"–"Heave and raise the dead!"–"Heave, and away!"
etc., etc.; but it would not do.  Nobody broke his back or his
hand-spike by his efforts.  And when the cat-tackle-fall was strung
along, and all hands–cook, steward, and all–laid hold, to cat the
anchor, instead of the lively song of “Cheerily, men!” in which all
hands join in the chorus, we pulled a long, heavy, silent pull,
and–as sailors say a song is as good as ten men–the anchor came
to the cat-head pretty slowly.  “Give us ’Cheerily!’” said the
mate; but there was no “cheerily” for us, and we did without it.
The captain walked the quarterdeck, and said not a word.  He must
have seen the change, but there was nothing which he could notice
officially.
We sailed leisurely down the coast before a light fair wind, keeping
the land well aboard, and saw two other missions, looking like blocks
of white plaster, shining in the distance; one of which, situated on
the top of a high hill, was San Juan Campestrano, under which vessels
sometimes come to anchor, in the summer season, and take off hides.
The most distant one was St. Louis Rey, which the third mate said
was only fifteen miles from San Diego.  At sunset on the second day,
we had a large and well wooded headland directly before us, behind
which lay the little harbor of San Diego.  We were becalmed off this
point all night, but the next morning, which was Saturday, the 14th
of March, having a good breeze, we stood round the point, and hauling
our wind, brought the little harbor, which is rather the outlet of a
small river, right before us.  Every one was anxious to get a view
of the new place.  A chain of high hills, beginning at the point,
(which was on our larboard hand, coming in,) protected the harbor
on the north and west, and ran off into the interior as far as the
eye could reach.  On the other sides, the land was low, and green,
but without trees.  The entrance is so narrow as to admit but one
vessel at a time, the current swift, and the channel runs so near to
a low stony point that the ship’s sides appeared almost to touch it.
There was no town in sight, but on the smooth sand beach, abreast,
and within a cable’s length of which three vessels lay moored,
were four large houses, built of rough boards, and looking like the
great barns in which ice is stored on the borders of the large ponds
near Boston; with piles of hides standing round them, and men in
red shirts and large straw hats, walking in and out of the doors.
These were the hide-houses.  Of the vessels: one, a short, clumsy,
little hermaphrodite brig, we recognized as our old acquaintance,
the Loriotte; another, with sharp bows and raking masts, newly painted
and tarred, and glittering in the morning sun, with the blood-red
banner and cross of St. George at her peak, was the handsome Ayacucho.
The third was a large ship, with top-gallant-masts housed, and sails
unbent, and looking as rusty and worn as two years’ “hide-droghing” could
make her.  This was the Lagoda.  As we drew near, carried rapidly
along by the current, we overhauled our chain, and clewed up the
topsails.  “Let go the anchor!” said the captain but either there was
not chain enough forward of the windlass, or the anchor went down
foul, or we had too much headway on, for it did not bring us up.
“Pay out chain!” shouted the captain; and we gave it to her; but it
would not do.  Before the other anchor could be let go, we drifted
down, broadside on, and went smash into the Lagoda.  Her crew were
at breakfast in the forecastle, and the cook, seeing us coming,
rushed out of his galley, and called up the officers and men.
Fortunately no great harm was done.  Her jib-boom ran between our
fore and main masts, carrying away some of our rigging, and breaking
down the rail.  She lost her martingale.  This brought us up, and as
they paid out chain, we swung clear of them, and let go the other
anchor; but this had as bad luck as the first, for, before any one
perceived it, we were drifting on to the Loriotte.  The captain now
gave out his orders rapidly and fiercely, sheeting home the topsails,
and backing and filling the sails, in hope of starting or clearing
the anchors; but it was all in vain, and he sat down on the rail,
taking it very leisurely, and calling out to Captain Nye, that he was
coming to pay him a visit.  We drifted fairly into the Loriotte, her
larboard bow into our starboard quarter, carrying away a part of our
starboard quarter railing, and breaking off her larboard bumpkin,
and one or two stanchions above the deck.  We saw our handsome
sailor, Jackson, on the forecastle, with the Sandwich Islanders,
working away to get us clear.  After paying out chain, we swung
clear, but our anchors were no doubt afoul of hers.  We manned
the windlass, and hove, and hove away, but to no purpose.
Sometimes we got a little upon the cable, but a good surge would take
it all back again.  We now began to drift down toward the Ayacucho,
when her boat put off and brought her commander, Captain Wilson,
on board.  He was a short, active, well-built man, between fifty
and sixty years of age; and being nearly twenty years older than
our captain, and a thorough seaman, he did not hesitate to give his
advice, and from giving advice, he gradually came to taking the
command; ordering us when to heave and when to pawl, and backing
and filling the topsails, setting and taking in jib and trysail,
whenever he thought best.  Our captain gave a few orders, but as
Wilson generally countermanded them, saying, in an easy, fatherly
kind of way, “Oh no! Captain T––-, you don’t want the jib on
her,” or “it isn’t time yet to heave!” he soon gave it up.  We had no
objections to this state of things, for Wilson was a kind old man,
and had an encouraging and pleasant way of speaking to us, which
made everything go easily.  After two or three hours of constant
labor at the windlass, heaving and “Yo ho!"-ing with all our might,
we brought up an anchor, with the Loriotte’s small bower fast to it,
Having cleared this and let it go, and cleared our hawse, we soon
got our other anchor, which had dragged half over the harbor.
“Now,” said Wilson, “I’ll find you a good berth;” and setting both
the topsails, he carried us down, and brought us to anchor, in
handsome style, directly abreast of the hide-house which we were to 
use.  Having done this, he took his leave, while we furled the sails,
and got our breakfast, which was welcome to us, for we had worked
hard, and it was nearly twelve o’clock.  After breakfast, and until
night, we were employed in getting out the boats and mooring ship.
After supper, two of us took the captain on board the Lagoda.
As he came alongside, he gave his name, and the mate, in the
gangway, called out to the captain down the companion-way–
“Captain T––- has come aboard, sir!”  “Has he brought his brig
with him?” said the rough old fellow, in a tone which made itself
heard fore and aft.  This mortified our captain a little, and it
became a standing joke among us for the rest of the voyage.
The captain went down into the cabin, and we walked forward and
put our heads down the forecastle, where we found the men at supper,
“Come down, shipmates! Come down!” said they, as soon as they
saw us; and we went down, and found a large, high forecastle, well
lighted; and a crew of twelve or fourteen men, eating out of their
kids and pans, and drinking their tea, and talking and laughing,
all as independent and easy as so many “wood-sawyer’s clerks."
This looked like comfort and enjoyment, compared with the dark
little forecastle, and scanty, discontented crew of the brig.
It was Saturday night; they had got through with their work for the
week; and being snugly moored, had nothing to do until Monday, again.
After two years’ hard service, they had seen the worst, and all,
of California;–had got their cargo nearly stowed, and expected to
sail in a week or two, for Boston.  We spent an hour or more with
them, talking over California matters, until the word was passed–
“Pilgrims, away!” and we went back with our captain.  They were
a hardy, but intelligent crew; a little roughened, and their clothes
patched and old, from California wear; all able seamen, and between
the ages of twenty and thirty-five.  They inquired about our vessel,
the usage, etc., and were not a little surprised at the story of
the flogging.  They said there were often difficulties in vessels
on the coast, and sometimes knock-downs and fightings, but they
had never heard before of a regular seizing-up and flogging.
“Spread-eagles” were a new kind of bird in California.
Sunday, they said, was always given in San Diego, both at the
hide-houses and on board the vessels, a large number usually
going up to the town, on liberty.  We learned a good deal from
them about curing and stowing of hides, etc. and they were
anxious to have the latest news (seven months old) from Boston.
One of their first inquiries was for Father Taylor, the seamen’s
preacher in Boston.  Then followed the usual strain of conversation,
inquiries, stories, and jokes, which, one must always hear in a ship’s
forecastle, but which are perhaps, after all, no worse, nor, indeed,
more gross, than that of many well-dressed gentlemen at their clubs.
