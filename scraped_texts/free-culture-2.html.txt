On December 17,1903, on a windy North Carolina beach for just shy of one hundred 
seconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a heavier-than-air, self-
propelled vehicle could fly. The moment was electric and its importance widely 
understood. Almost immediately, there was an explosion of interest in this 
newfound technology of manned flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build 
upon it.
At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American law held that a 
property owner presumptively owned not just the surface of his land, but all the 
land below, down to the center of the earth, and all the space above, to an 
indefinite extent, upwards. [1] For many years, scholars had puzzled about how 
best to interpret the idea that rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean 
that you owned the stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and 
regular trespass?
Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of American lawdeep 
within the foundations of our tradition, and acknowledged by the most important 
legal thinkers of our pastmattered. If my land reaches to the heavens, what 
happens when United flies over my field? Do I have the right to banish it from 
my property? Am I allowed to enter into an exclusive license with Delta 
Airlines? Could we set up an auction to decide how much these rights are worth?
In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Carolina farmers 
Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens because of low-flying 
military aircraft (the terrified chickens apparently flew into the barn walls 
and died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit saying that the government was 
trespassing on their land. The airplanes, of course, never touched the surface 
of the Causbys’ land. But if, as Blackstone, Kent, and Coke had said, their land 
reached to an indefinite extent, upwards, then the government was trespassing 
on their property, and the Causbys wanted it to stop.
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys’ case. Congress had declared the 
airways public, but if one’s property really extended to the heavens, then 
Congress’s declaration could well have been an unconstitutional taking of 
property without compensation. The Court acknowledged that it is ancient 
doctrine that common law ownership of the land extended to the periphery of the 
universe. But Justice Douglas had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single 
paragraph, hundreds of years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the 
Court,
[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a public highway, 
as Congress has declared. Were that not true, every transcontinental flight 
would subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense revolts at 
the idea. To recognize such private claims to the airspace would clog these 
highways, seriously interfere with their control and development in the public 
interest, and transfer into private ownership that to which only the public has 
a just claim. [2]
Common sense revolts at the idea.
This is how the law usually works. Not often this abruptly or impatiently, but 
eventually, this is how it works. It was Douglas’s style not to dither. Other 
justices would have blathered on for pages to reach the conclusion that Douglas 
holds in a single line: Common sense revolts at the idea. But whether it takes 
pages or a few words, it is the special genius of a common law system, as ours 
is, that the law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it 
changes. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in another.
Or at least, this is how things happen when there’s no one powerful on the other 
side of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And though there were no 
doubt many like them who were upset by the growing traffic in the air (though 
one hopes not many chickens flew themselves into walls), the Causbys of the 
world would find it very hard to unite and stop the idea, and the technology, 
that the Wright brothers had birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into 
the technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken 
coop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by what seemed 
reasonable given the technology that the Wrights had produced. They could stand 
on their farms, dead chickens in hand, and shake their fists at these newfangled 
technologies all they wanted. They could call their representatives or even file 
a lawsuit. But in the end, the force of what seems obvious to everyone else
the power of common sensewould prevail. Their private interest would not be 
allowed to defeat an obvious public gain.
Edwin Howard Armstrong is one of America’s forgotten inventor geniuses. He came 
to the great American inventor scene just after the titans Thomas Edison and 
Alexander Graham Bell. But his work in the area of radio technology was perhaps 
the most important of any single inventor in the first fifty years of radio. He 
was better educated than Michael Faraday, who as a bookbinder’s apprentice had 
discovered electric induction in 1831. But he had the same intuition about how 
the world of radio worked, and on at least three occasions, Armstrong invented 
profoundly important technologies that advanced our understanding of radio.
On the day after Christmas, 1933, four patents were issued to Armstrong for his 
most significant inventionFM radio. Until then, consumer radio had been 
amplitude-modulated (AM) radio. The theorists of the day had said that 
frequency-modulated (FM) radio could never work. They were right about FM radio 
in a narrow band of spectrum. But Armstrong discovered that frequency-modulated 
radio in a wide band of spectrum would deliver an astonishing fidelity of sound, 
with much less transmitter power and static.
On November 5, 1935, he demonstrated the technology at a meeting of the 
Institute of Radio Engineers at the Empire State Building in New York City. He 
tuned his radio dial across a range of AM stations, until the radio locked on a 
broadcast that he had arranged from seventeen miles away. The radio fell totally 
silent, as if dead, and then with a clarity no one else in that room had ever 
heard from an electrical device, it produced the sound of an announcer’s voice: 
This is amateur station W2AG at Yonkers, New York, operating on frequency 
modulation at two and a half meters.
The audience was hearing something no one had thought possible:
A glass of water was poured before the microphone in Yonkers; it sounded like a 
glass of water being poured. ... A paper was crumpled and torn; it sounded like 
paper and not like a crackling forest fire. ... Sousa marches were played from 
records and a piano solo and guitar number were performed. ... The music was 
projected with a live-ness rarely if ever heard before from a radio music box. 
 [3] 
As our own common sense tells us, Armstrong had discovered a vastly superior 
radio technology. But at the time of his invention, Armstrong was working for 
RCA. RCA was the dominant player in the then dominant AM radio market. By 1935, 
there were a thousand radio stations across the United States, but the stations 
in large cities were all owned by a handful of networks.
RCA’s president, David Sarnoff, a friend of Armstrong’s, was eager that 
Armstrong discover a way to remove static from AM radio. So Sarnoff was quite 
excited when Armstrong told him he had a device that removed static from 
radio. But when Armstrong demonstrated his invention, Sarnoff was not pleased.
I thought Armstrong would invent some kind of a filter to remove static from 
our AM radio. I didn’t think he’d start a revolutionstart up a whole damn new 
industry to compete with RCA. [4]
Armstrong’s invention threatened RCA’s AM empire, so the company launched a 
campaign to smother FM radio. While FM may have been a superior technology, 
Sarnoff was a superior tactician. As one author described,
The forces for FM, largely engineering, could not overcome the weight of 
strategy devised by the sales, patent, and legal offices to subdue this threat 
to corporate position. For FM, if allowed to develop unrestrained, posed ... a 
complete reordering of radio power ... and the eventual overthrow of the 
carefully restricted AM system on which RCA had grown to power. [5]
RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further tests were 
needed. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong grew impatient, RCA began to 
use its power with the government to stall FM radio’s deployment generally. In 
1936, RCA hired the former head of the FCC and assigned him the task of assuring 
that the FCC assign spectrum in a way that would castrate FMprincipally by 
moving FM radio to a different band of spectrum. At first, these efforts failed. 
But when Armstrong and the nation were distracted by World War II, RCA’s work 
began to be more successful. Soon after the war ended, the FCC announced a set 
of policies that would have one clear effect: FM radio would be crippled. As 
Lawrence Lessing described it,
The series of body blows that FM radio received right after the war, in a 
series of rulings manipulated through the FCC by the big radio interests, were 
almost incredible in their force and deviousness. [6]
To make room in the spectrum for RCA’s latest gamble, television, FM radio users 
were to be moved to a totally new spectrum band. The power of FM radio stations 
was also cut, meaning FM could no longer be used to beam programs from one part 
of the country to another. (This change was strongly supported by AT&T, because 
the loss of FM relaying stations would mean radio stations would have to buy 
wired links from AT&T.) The spread of FM radio was thus choked, at least 
temporarily. 
Armstrong resisted RCA’s efforts. In response, RCA resisted Armstrong’s patents. 
After incorporating FM technology into the emerging standard for television, RCA 
declared the patents invalidbaselessly, and almost fifteen years after they 
were issued. It thus refused to pay him royalties. For six years, Armstrong 
fought an expensive war of litigation to defend the patents. Finally, just as 
the patents expired, RCA offered a settlement so low that it would not even 
cover Armstrong’s lawyers’ fees. Defeated, broken, and now broke, in 1954 
Armstrong wrote a short note to his wife and then stepped out of a thirteenth-
story window to his death.
This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically, and rarely with 
heroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it works. From the beginning, 
government and government agencies have been subject to capture. They are more 
likely captured when a powerful interest is threatened by either a legal or 
technical change. That powerful interest too often exerts its influence within 
the government to get the government to protect it. The rhetoric of this 
protection is of course always public spirited; the reality is something 
different. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age, but that, left to 
themselves, would crumble in another, are sustained through this subtle 
corruption of our political process. RCA had what the Causbys did not: the power 
to stifle the effect of technological change.
There’s no single inventor of the Internet. Nor is there any good date upon 
which to mark its birth. Yet in a very short time, the Internet has become part 
of ordinary American life. According to the Pew Internet and American Life 
Project, 58 percent of Americans had access to the Internet in 2002, up from 49 
percent two years before. [7] That number could well exceed two thirds of the 
nation by the end of 2004.
As the Internet has been integrated into ordinary life, it has changed things. 
Some of these changes are technicalthe Internet has made communication faster, 
it has lowered the cost of gathering data, and so on. These technical changes 
are not the focus of this book. They are important. They are not well 
understood. But they are the sort of thing that would simply go away if we all 
just switched the Internet off. They don’t affect people who don’t use the 
Internet, or at least they don’t affect them directly. They are the proper 
subject of a book about the Internet. But this is not a book about the Internet.
Instead, this book is about an effect of the Internet beyond the Internet 
itself: an effect upon how culture is made. My claim is that the Internet has 
induced an important and unrecognized change in that process. That change will 
radically transform a tradition that is as old as the Republic itself. Most, if 
they recognized this change, would reject it. Yet most don’t even see the change 
that the Internet has introduced.
We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between commercial and 
noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s regulation of each. By 
commercial culture I mean that part of our culture that is produced and sold 
or produced to be sold. By noncommercial culture I mean all the rest. When old 
men sat around parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others 
consumed, that was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his 
Reader, or Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture.
At the beginning of our history, and for just about the whole of our tradition, 
noncommercial culture was essentially unregulated. Of course, if your stories 
were lewd, or if your song disturbed the peace, then the law might intervene. 
But the law was never directly concerned with the creation or spread of this 
form of culture, and it left this culture free. The ordinary ways in which 
ordinary individuals shared and transformed their culturetelling stories, 
reenacting scenes from plays or TV, participating in fan clubs, sharing music, 
making tapeswere left alone by the law.
The focus of the law was on commercial creativity. At first slightly, then quite 
extensively, the law protected the incentives of creators by granting them 
exclusive rights to their creative work, so that they could sell those exclusive 
rights in a commercial marketplace. [8] This is also, of course, an important 
part of creativity and culture, and it has become an increasingly important part 
in America. But in no sense was it dominant within our tradition. It was instead 
just one part, a controlled part, balanced with the free.
This rough divide between the free and the controlled has now been erased. [9] 
The Internet has set the stage for this erasure and, pushed by big media, the 
law has now affected it. For the first time in our tradition, the ordinary ways 
in which individuals create and share culture fall within the reach of the 
regulation of the law, which has expanded to draw within its control a vast 
amount of culture and creativity that it never reached before. The technology 
that preserved the balance of our historybetween uses of our culture that were 
free and uses of our culture that were only upon permissionhas been undone. The 
consequence is that we are less and less a free culture, more and more a 
permission culture. 
This change gets justified as necessary to protect commercial creativity. And 
indeed, protectionism is precisely its motivation. But the protectionism that 
justifies the changes that I will describe below is not the limited and balanced 
sort that has defined the law in the past. This is not a protectionism to 
protect artists. It is instead a protectionism to protect certain forms of 
business. Corporations threatened by the potential of the Internet to change the 
way both commercial and noncommercial culture are made and shared have united to 
induce lawmakers to use the law to protect them. It is the story of RCA and 
Armstrong; it is the dream of the Causbys.
For the Internet has unleashed an extraordinary possibility for many to 
participate in the process of building and cultivating a culture that reaches 
far beyond local boundaries. That power has changed the marketplace for making 
and cultivating culture generally, and that change in turn threatens established 
content industries. The Internet is thus to the industries that built and 
distributed content in the twentieth century what FM radio was to AM radio, or 
what the truck was to the railroad industry of the nineteenth century: the 
beginning of the end, or at least a substantial transformation. Digital 
technologies, tied to the Internet, could produce a vastly more competitive and 
vibrant market for building and cultivating culture; that market could include a 
much wider and more diverse range of creators; those creators could produce and 
distribute a much more vibrant range of creativity; and depending upon a few 
important factors, those creators could earn more on average from this system 
than creators do todayall so long as the RCAs of our day don’t use the law to 
protect themselves against this competition.
Yet, as I argue in the pages that follow, that is precisely what is happening in 
our culture today. These modern-day equivalents of the early twentieth-century 
radio or nineteenth-century railroads are using their power to get the law to 
protect them against this new, more efficient, more vibrant technology for 
building culture. They are succeeding in their plan to remake the Internet 
before the Internet remakes them.
It doesn’t seem this way to many. The battles over copyright and the Internet 
seem remote to most. To the few who follow them, they seem mainly about a much 
simpler brace of questionswhether piracy will be permitted, and whether 
property will be protected. The war that has been waged against the 
technologies of the Internetwhat Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) 
president Jack Valenti calls his own terrorist war [10]has been framed as a 
battle about the rule of law and respect for property. To know which side to 
take in this war, most think that we need only decide whether we’re for property 
or against it.
If those really were the choices, then I would be with Jack Valenti and the 
content industry. I, too, am a believer in property, and especially in the 
importance of what Mr. Valenti nicely calls creative property. I believe that 
piracy is wrong, and that the law, properly tuned, should punish piracy, 
whether on or off the Internet.
But those simple beliefs mask a much more fundamental question and a much more 
dramatic change. My fear is that unless we come to see this change, the war to 
rid the world of Internet pirates will also rid our culture of values that 
have been integral to our tradition from the start.
These values built a tradition that, for at least the first 180 years of our 
Republic, guaranteed creators the right to build freely upon their past, and 
protected creators and innovators from either state or private control. The 
First Amendment protected creators against state control. And as Professor Neil 
Netanel powerfully argues, [11] copyright law, properly balanced, protected 
creators against private control. Our tradition was thus neither Soviet nor the 
tradition of patrons. It instead carved out a wide berth within which creators 
could cultivate and extend our culture.
Yet the law’s response to the Internet, when tied to changes in the technology 
of the Internet itself, has massively increased the effective regulation of 
creativity in America. To build upon or critique the culture around us one must 
ask, Oliver Twistlike, for permission first. Permission is, of course, often 
grantedbut it is not often granted to the critical or the independent. We have 
built a kind of cultural nobility; those within the noble class live easily; 
those outside it don’t. But it is nobility of any form that is alien to our 
tradition. 
The story that follows is about this war. Is it not about the centrality of 
technology to ordinary life. I don’t believe in gods, digital or otherwise. Nor 
is it an effort to demonize any individual or group, for neither do I believe in 
a devil, corporate or otherwise. It is not a morality tale. Nor is it a call to 
jihad against an industry. 
It is instead an effort to understand a hopelessly destructive war inspired by 
the technologies of the Internet but reaching far beyond its code. And by 
understanding this battle, it is an effort to map peace. There is no good reason 
for the current struggle around Internet technologies to continue. There will be 
great harm to our tradition and culture if it is allowed to continue unchecked. 
We must come to understand the source of this war. We must resolve it soon.
Like the Causbys’ battle, this war is, in part, about property. The property 
of this war is not as tangible as the Causbys’, and no innocent chicken has yet 
to lose its life. Yet the ideas surrounding this property are as obvious to 
most as the Causbys’ claim about the sacredness of their farm was to them. We 
are the Causbys. Most of us take for granted the extraordinarily powerful claims 
that the owners of intellectual property now assert. Most of us, like the 
Causbys, treat these claims as obvious. And hence we, like the Causbys, object 
when a new technology interferes with this property. It is as plain to us as it 
was to them that the new technologies of the Internet are trespassing upon 
legitimate claims of property. It is as plain to us as it was to them that the 
law should intervene to stop this trespass.
And thus, when geeks and technologists defend their Armstrong or Wright brothers 
technology, most of us are simply unsympathetic. Common sense does not revolt. 
Unlike in the case of the unlucky Causbys, common sense is on the side of the 
property owners in this war. Unlike the lucky Wright brothers, the Internet has 
not inspired a revolution on its side. 
My hope is to push this common sense along. I have become increasingly amazed by 
the power of this idea of intellectual property and, more importantly, its power 
to disable critical thought by policy makers and citizens. There has never been 
a time in our history when more of our culture was as owned as it is now. 
And yet there has never been a time when the concentration of power to control 
the uses of culture has been as unquestioningly accepted as it is now. 
The puzzle is, Why?
Is it because we have come to understand a truth about the value and importance 
of absolute property over ideas and culture? Is it because we have discovered 
that our tradition of rejecting such an absolute claim was wrong?
Or is it because the idea of absolute property over ideas and culture 
benefits the RCAs of our time and fits our own unreflective intuitions?
Is the radical shift away from our tradition of free culture an instance of 
America correcting a mistake from its past, as we did after a bloody war with 
slavery, and as we are slowly doing with inequality? Or is the radical shift 
away from our tradition of free culture yet another example of a political 
system captured by a few powerful special interests?
Does common sense lead to the extremes on this question because common sense 
actually believes in these extremes? Or does common sense stand silent in the 
face of these extremes because, as with Armstrong versus RCA, the more powerful 
side has ensured that it has the more powerful view?
I don’t mean to be mysterious. My own views are resolved. I believe it was right 
for common sense to revolt against the extremism of the Causbys. I believe it 
would be right for common sense to revolt against the extreme claims made today 
on behalf of intellectual property. What the law demands today is increasingly 
as silly as a sheriff arresting an airplane for trespass. But the consequences 
of this silliness will be much more profound. 
The struggle that rages just now centers on two ideas: piracy and property. 
My aim in this book’s next two parts is to explore these two ideas.
My method is not the usual method of an academic. I don’t want to plunge you 
into a complex argument, buttressed with references to obscure French theorists
however natural that is for the weird sort we academics have become. Instead I 
begin in each part with a collection of stories that set a context within which 
these apparently simple ideas can be more fully understood.
The two sections set up the core claim of this book: that while the Internet has 
indeed produced something fantastic and new, our government, pushed by big media 
to respond to this something new, is destroying something very old. Rather 
than understanding the changes the Internet might permit, and rather than taking 
time to let common sense resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those 
most threatened by the changes to use their power to change the lawand more 
importantly, to use their power to change something fundamental about who we 
have always been.
We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because most of us 
really believe in these changes. We allow it because the interests most 
threatened are among the most powerful players in our depressingly compromised 
process of making law. This book is the story of one more consequence of this 
form of corruptiona consequence to which most of us remain oblivious.
