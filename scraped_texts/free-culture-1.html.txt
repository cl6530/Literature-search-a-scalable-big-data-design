At the end of his review of my first book, Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace, 
David Pogue, a brilliant writer and author of countless technical and computer-
related texts, wrote this:
Unlike actual law, Internet software has no capacity to punish. It doesn’t 
affect people who aren’t online (and only a tiny minority of the world 
population is). And if you don’t like the Internet’s system, you can always flip 
off the modem. [1]
Pogue was skeptical of the core argument of the bookthat software, or code, 
functioned as a kind of lawand his review suggested the happy thought that if 
life in cyberspace got bad, we could always drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome-
like simply flip a switch and be back home. Turn off the modem, unplug the 
computer, and any troubles that exist in that space wouldn’t affect us 
anymore.
Pogue might have been right in 1999I’m skeptical, but maybe. But even if he was 
right then, the point is not right now: Free Culture is about the troubles the 
Internet causes even after the modem is turned off. It is an argument about how 
the battles that now rage regarding life on-line have fundamentally affected 
people who aren’t online. There is no switch that will insulate us from the 
Internet’s effect.
But unlike Code, the argument here is not much about the Internet itself. It 
is instead about the consequence of the Internet to a part of our tradition that 
is much more fundamental, and, as hard as this is for a geek-wanna-be to admit, 
much more important.
That tradition is the way our culture gets made. As I explain in the pages that 
follow, we come from a tradition of free culturenot free as in free beer 
(to borrow a phrase from the founder of the free-software movement [2]), but 
free as in free speech, free markets, free trade, free enterprise, 
free will, and free elections. A free culture supports and protects creators 
and innovators. It does this directly by granting intellectual property rights. 
But it does so indirectly by limiting the reach of those rights, to guarantee 
that follow-on creators and innovators remain as free as possible from the 
control of the past. A free culture is not a culture without property, just as a 
free market is not a market in which everything is free. The opposite of a free 
culture is a permission culturea culture in which creators get to create only 
with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the past.
If we understood this change, I believe we would resist it. Not we on the Left 
or you on the Right, but we who have no stake in the particular industries of 
culture that defined the twentieth century. Whether you are on the Left or the 
Right, if you are in this sense disinterested, then the story I tell here will 
trouble you. For the changes I describe affect values that both sides of our 
political culture deem fundamental.
We saw a glimpse of this bipartisan outrage in the early summer of 2003. As the 
FCC considered changes in media ownership rules that would relax limits on media 
concentration, an extraordinary coalition generated more than 700,000 letters to 
the FCC opposing the change. As William Safire described marching uncomfortably 
alongside CodePink Women for Peace and the National Rifle Association, between 
liberal Olympia Snowe and conservative Ted Stevens, he formulated perhaps most 
simply just what was at stake: the concentration of power. And as he asked,
Does that sound unconservative? Not to me. The concentration of power
political, corporate, media, culturalshould be anathema to conservatives. The 
diffusion of power through local control, thereby encouraging individual 
participation, is the essence of federalism and the greatest expression of 
democracy. [3]
This idea is an element of the argument of Free Culture, though my focus is 
not just on the concentration of power produced by concentrations in ownership, 
but more importantly, if because less visibly, on the concentration of power 
produced by a radical change in the effective scope of the law. The law is 
changing; that change is altering the way our culture gets made; that change 
should worry youwhether or not you care about the Internet, and whether you’re 
on Safire’s left or on his right. 
The inspiration for the title and for much of the argument of this book comes 
from the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. Indeed, as I 
reread Stallman’s own work, especially the essays in Free Software, Free 
Society, I realize that all of the theoretical insights I develop here are 
insights Stallman described decades ago. One could thus well argue that this 
work is merely derivative. 
I accept that criticism, if indeed it is a criticism. The work of a lawyer is 
always derivative, and I mean to do nothing more in this book than to remind a 
culture about a tradition that has always been its own. Like Stallman, I defend 
that tradition on the basis of values. Like Stallman, I believe those are the 
values of freedom. And like Stallman, I believe those are values of our past 
that will need to be defended in our future. A free culture has been our past, 
but it will only be our future if we change the path we are on right now. 
Like Stallman’s arguments for free software, an argument for free culture 
stumbles on a confusion that is hard to avoid, and even harder to understand. A 
free culture is not a culture without property; it is not a culture in which 
artists don’t get paid. A culture without property, or in which creators can’t 
get paid, is anarchy, not freedom. Anarchy is not what I advance here. 
Instead, the free culture that I defend in this book is a balance between 
anarchy and control. A free culture, like a free market, is filled with 
property. It is filled with rules of property and contract that get enforced by 
the state. But just as a free market is perverted if its property becomes 
feudal, so too can a free culture be queered by extremism in the property rights 
that define it. That is what I fear about our culture today. It is against that 
extremism that this book is written.
