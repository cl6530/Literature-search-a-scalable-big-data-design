 How and about Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith was a very worthy Clergyman, who lived in the Parish
where Little Margery and Tommy were born; and having a
Relation come to see him, who was a charitable good Man, he sent for
these Children to him. The Gentleman ordered Little Margery a
new Pair of Shoes, gave Mr. Smith some Money to buy her
Cloathes; and said, he would take Tommy and make him a little
Sailor; and accordingly had a Jacket and Trowsers made for him, in
which he now appears. Pray look at him.
After some Days the Gentleman intended to go to London, and
take little Tommy with him, of whom you will know more by and

History, his Travels and Adventures.
The Parting between these two little Children was very affecting,
Tommy cried, and Margery cried, and they kissed each
other an hundred Times. At last Tommy thus wiped off her Tears
with the End of his Jacket, and bid her cry no more, for that he would
come to her again, when he returned from Sea. However, as they were so
very fond, the Gentleman would not suffer them to take Leave of each
other; but told Tommy he should ride out with him, and come
back at Night. When night came, Little Margery grew very uneasy
about her Brother, and after sitting up as late as Mr. Smithwould let her, she went crying to Bed.
