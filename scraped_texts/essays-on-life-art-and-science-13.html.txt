authentic in every particular, and that the originals are now in my

{7}  Since this essay was written it has been ascertained by
Cavaliere Francesco Negri, of Casale Monferrato, that Tabachetti
died in 1615.  If, therefore, the Sanctuary of Montrigone was not
founded until 1631, it is plain that Tabachetti cannot have worked
there.  All the latest discoveries about Tabachetti’s career will be
found in Cavaliere Negri’s pamphlet “Il Santuario di Crea"
(Alessandria, 1902).  See also note on p. 154.—R. A. S.

{13}  M. Ruppen’s words run:  “1687 wurde die Kapelle zur hohen
Stiege gebaut, 1747 durch Zusatz vergrossert und 1755 mit Orgeln
ausgestattet.  Anton Ruppen, ein geschickter Steinhauer mid
Maurermeister leitete den Kapellebau, und machte darin das kleinere
Altarlein.  Bei der hohen Stiege war fruher kein Gebetshauslein; nur
ein wunderthatiges Bildlein der Mutter Gottes stand da in einer
Mauer vor dem fromme Hirten und viel andachtiges Volk unter freiem
Himmel beteten.
“1709 wurden die kleinen Kapellelein die 15 Geheimnisse des Psalters
vorstelland auf dem Wege zur hohen Stiege gebaut.  Jeder Haushalter
des Viertels Fee ubernahm den Bau eines dieser Geheimnisskapellen,
und ein besonderer Gutthater dieser frommen Unternehmung war
Heinrich Andenmatten, nachher Bruder der Geselischaft Jesu.”
{14}  The story of Tabachetti’s incarceration is very doubtful.
Cavaliere F. Negri, to whose book on Tabachetti and his work at Crea
I have already referred the reader, does not mention it.  Tabachetti
left his native Dinant in 1585, and from that date until his death
in 1615 he appears to have worked chiefly at Varallo and Crea.
There is a document in existence stating that in 1588 he executed a
statue for the hermitage of S. Rocco, at Crea, which, if it is to be
relied on, disposes both of the incarceration and of the visit to
Saas.  It is possible, however, that the date is 1598, in which case
Butler’s theory of the visit to Saas may hold good.  In 1590
Tabachetti was certainly at Varallo, and again in 1594, 1599, and
1602.  He died in 1615, possibly during a visit to Varallo, though
his home at that time was Costigliole, near Asti.—R. A. S.
{15}  This is thus chronicled by M. Ruppen:  “1589 den 9 September
war eine Wassergrosse, die viel Schaden verursachte.  Die
Thalstrasse, die von den Steinmatten an bis zur Kirche am Ufer der
Visp lag, wurde ganz zerstort.  Man ward gezwungen eine neue Strasse
in einiger Entfernung vom Wasser durch einen alten Fussweg
auszuhauen welche vier und einerhalben Viertel der Klafter, oder 6
Schuh und 9 Zoll breit soilte.”  (p. 43).

{29}  Mr. J. T. Cunningham, of the Marine Biological Laboratory,
Plymouth, has called my attention to the fact that I have ascribed
to Professor Ray Lankester a criticism on Mr. Wallace’s remarks upon
the eyes of certain fiat-fish, which Professor Ray Lankester was, in
reality, only adopting—with full acknowledgment—from Mr.
Cunningham.  Mr. Cunningham has left it to me whether to correct my
omission publicly or not, but he would so plainly prefer my doing so
that I consider myself bound to insert this note.  Curiously enough
I find that in my book “Evolution Old and New,” I gave what Lamarck
actually said upon the eyes of flat-fish, and having been led to
return to the subject, I may as well quote his words.  He wrote:-
“Need—always occasioned by the circumstances in which an animal is
placed, and followed by sustained efforts at gratification—can not
only modify an organ—that is to say, augment or reduce it—but can
change its position when the case requires its removal.
“Ocean fishes have occasion to see what is on either side of them,
and have their eyes accordingly placed on either side of their head.
Some fishes, however, have their abode near coasts on submarine
banks and inclinations, and are thus forced to flatten themselves as
much as possible in order to get as near as they can to the shore.
In this situation they receive more light from above than from
below, and find it necessary to pay attention to whatever happens to
be above them; this need has involved the displacement of their
eyes, which now take the remarkable position which we observe in the
case of soles, turbots, plaice, &c.  The transfer of position is not
even yet complete in the case of these fishes, and the eyes are not,
therefore, symmetrically placed; but they are so with the skate,
whose head and whole body are equally disposed on either side a
longitudinal section.  Hence the eyes of this fish are placed
symmetrically upon the uppermost side."—Philosophie Zoologique,
