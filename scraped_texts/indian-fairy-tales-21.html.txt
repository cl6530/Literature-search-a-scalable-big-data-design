At the same time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the future
Buddha was born one of a peasant family; and when he grew up, he gained
his living by tilling the ground.
At that time a hawker used to go from place to place, trafficking in
goods carried by an ass. Now at each place he came to, when he took the
pack down from the ass’s back, he used to clothe him in a lion’s skin,
and turn him loose in the rice and barley fields. And when the watchmen
in the fields saw the ass, they dared not go near him, taking him for a
lion.
So one day the hawker stopped in a village; and whilst he was getting
his own breakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a lion’s skin, and
turned him loose in a barley-field. The watchmen in the field dared not
go up to him; but going home, they published the news. Then all the
villagers came out with weapons in their hands; and blowing chanks, and
beating drums, they went near the field and shouted. Terrified with the
fear of death, the ass uttered a cry–the bray of an ass!
And when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronounced
the First Verse:
  “This is not a lion’s roaring,
  Nor a tiger’s, nor a panther’s;
  Dressed in a lion’s skin,
  ’Tis a wretched ass that roars!”
But when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat him
till his bones broke; and, carrying off the lion’s skin, went away.
Then the hawker came; and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight,
pronounced the Second Verse:
  “Long might the ass,
  Clad in a lion’s skin,
  Have fed on the barley green.
  But he brayed!
  And that moment he came to ruin.”
And even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!
