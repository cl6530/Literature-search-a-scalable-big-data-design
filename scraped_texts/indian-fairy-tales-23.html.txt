In a country were seven daughters of poor parents, who used to come
daily to play under the shady trees in the King’s garden with the
gardener’s daughter; and daily she used to say to them, “When I am
married I shall have a son. Such a beautiful boy as he will be has
never been seen. He will have a moon on his forehead and a star on his
chin.” Then her playfellows used to laugh at her and mock her.
But one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy she
would have when she was married, and he said to himself he should like
very much to have such a son; the more so that though he had already
four Queens he had no child. He went, therefore, to the gardener and
told him he wished to marry his daughter. This delighted the gardener
and his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for their daughter
to become a princess. So they said “Yes” to the King, and invited all
their friends to the wedding. The King invited all his, and he gave the
gardener as much money as he wanted. Then the wedding was held with
great feasting and rejoicing.
A year later the day drew near on which the gardener’s daughter was to
have her son; and the King’s four other Queens came constantly to see
her. One day they said to her, “The King hunts every day; and the time
is soon coming when you will have your child. Suppose you fell ill
whilst he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of your
illness, what would you do then?”
When the King came home that evening, the gardener’s daughter said to
him, “Every day you go out hunting. Should I ever be in trouble or sick
while you are away, how could I send for you?” The King gave her a
kettle-drum which he placed near the door for her, and he said to her,
“Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum. No matter how far away I
may be, I shall hear it, and will come at once to you.”
Next morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens
came to see the gardener’s daughter. She told them all about her
kettle-drum. “Oh,” they said, “do drum on it just to see if the King
really will come to you.”
“No, I will not,” she said; “for why should I call him from his hunting
when I do not want him?”
“Don’t mind interrupting his hunting,” they answered. “Do try if he
really will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum.” So at last,
just to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her.
“Why have you called me?” he said. “See, I have left my hunting to come
to you.”
“I want nothing,” she answered; “I only wished to know if you really
would come to me when I beat my drum.”
“Very well,” answered the King; “but do not call me again unless you
really need me.” Then he returned to his hunting.
The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four
Queens again came to see the gardener’s daughter. They begged and
begged her to beat her drum once more, “just to see if the King will
really come to see you this time.” At first she refused, but at last
she consented. So she beat her drum, and the King came to her. But when
he found she was neither ill nor in trouble, he was angry, and said to
her, “Twice I have left my hunting and lost my game to come to you when
you did not need me. Now you may call me as much as you like, but I
will not come to you,” and then he went away in a rage.
The third day the gardener’s daughter fell ill, and she beat and beat
her kettle-drum; but the King never came. He heard her kettle-drum, but
he thought, “She does not really want me; she is only trying to see if
I will go to her.”
Meanwhile the four other Queens came to her, and they said, “Here it is
the custom before a child is born to bind its mother’s eyes with a
handkerchief that she may not see it just at first. So let us bind your
eyes.” She answered, “Very well, bind my eyes.” The four wives then
tied a handkerchief over them.
Soon after, the gardener’s daughter had a beautiful little son, with a
moon on his forehead and a star on his chin, and before the poor mother
had seen him, the four wicked Queens took the boy to the nurse and said
to her, “Now you must not let this child make the least sound for fear
his mother should hear him; and in the night you must either kill him,
or else take him away, so that his mother may never see him. If you
obey our orders, we will give you a great many rupees.” All this they
did out of spite. The nurse took the little child and put him into a
box, and the four Queens went back to the gardener’s daughter.
First they put a stone into her boy’s little bed, and then they took
the handkerchief off her eyes and showed it her, saying, “Look! this is
your son!” The poor girl cried bitterly, and thought, “What will the
King say when he finds no child?” But she could do nothing.
When the King came home; he was furious at hearing his youngest wife,
the gardener’s daughter, had given him a stone instead of the beautiful
little son she had promised him. He made her one of the palace
servants, and never spoke to her.
In the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the
beautiful little prince, and went out to a broad plain in the jungle.
There she dug a hole, made the fastenings of the box sure, and put the
box into the hole, although the child in it was still alive. The King’s
dog, whose name was Shankar, had followed her to see what she did with
the box. As soon as she had gone back to the four Queens (who gave her
a great many rupees), the dog went to the hole in which she had put the
box, took the box out, and opened it. When he saw the beautiful little
boy, he was very much delighted and said, “If it pleases Khuda that
this child should live, I will not hurt him; I will not eat him, but I
will swallow him whole and hide him in my stomach.” This he did.
After six months had passed, the dog went by night to the jungle, and
thought, “I wonder whether the boy is alive or dead.” Then he brought
the child out of his stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was
now six months old. When Shankar had caressed and loved him, he
swallowed him again for another six months. At the end of that time he
went once more by night to the broad jungle-plain. There he brought up
the child out of his stomach (the child was now a year old), and
caressed and petted him a great deal, and was made very happy by his
great beauty.
But this time the dog’s keeper had followed and watched the dog; and he
saw all that Shankar did, and the beautiful little child, so he ran to
the four Queens and said to them, “Inside the King’s dog there is a
child! the loveliest child! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on
his chin. Such a child has never been seen!” At this the four wives
were very much frightened, and as soon as the King came home from
hunting they said to him, “While you were away your dog came to our
rooms, and tore our clothes and knocked about all our things. We are
afraid he will kill us.” “Do not be afraid,” said the King. “Eat your
dinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow morning.”
Then he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn, but the dog
heard him, and said to himself, “What shall I do? The King intends to
kill me. I don’t care about that, but what will become of the child if
I am killed? He will die. But I will see if I cannot save him.”
So when it was night, the dog ran to the King’s cow, who was called
Suri, and said to her, “Suri, I want to give you something, for the
King has ordered me to be shot to-morrow. Will you take great care of
whatever I give you?”
“Let me see what it is,” said Suri, “I will take care of it if I can."
Then they both went together to the wide plain, and there the dog
brought up the boy. Suri was enchanted with him. “I never saw such a
beautiful child in this country,” she said. “See, he has a moon on his
forehead and a star on his chin. I will take the greatest care of him."
So saying she swallowed the little prince. The dog made her a great
many salaams, and said, “To-morrow I shall die;” and the cow then went
back to her stable.
Next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot.
The child now lived in Suri’s stomach; and when one whole year had
passed, and he was two years old, the cow went out to the plain, and
said to herself, “I do not know whether the child is alive or dead. But
I have never hurt it, so I will see.” Then she brought up the boy; and
he played about, and Suri was delighted; she loved him and caressed
him, and talked to him. Then she swallowed him, and returned to her
stable.
At the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up
the child. He played and ran about for an hour to her great delight,
and she talked to him and caressed him. His great beauty made her very
happy. Then she swallowed him once more and returned to her stable. The
child was now three years old.
But this time the cowherd had followed Suri, and had seen the wonderful
child and all she did to it. So he ran and told the four Queens, “The
King’s cow has a beautiful boy inside her. He has a moon on his
forehead and a star on his chin. Such a child has never been seen
before!”
At this the Queens were terrified. They tore their clothes and their
hair and cried. When the King came home at evening, he asked them why
they were so agitated. “Oh,” they said, “your cow came and tried to
kill us; but we ran away. She tore our hair and our clothes.” “Never
mind,” said the King. “Eat your dinner and be happy. The cow shall be
killed to-morrow morning.”
Now Suri heard the King give this order to the servants, so she said to
herself, “What shall I do to save the child?” When it was midnight, she
went to the King’s horse called Katar, who was very wicked, and quite
untameable. No one had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one could
go near him with safety, he was so savage. Suri said to this horse,
“Katar, will you take care of something that I want to give you,
because the King has ordered me to be killed to-morrow?”
“Good,” said Katar; “show me what it is.” Then Suri brought up the
child, and the horse was delighted with him. “Yes,” he said, “I will
take the greatest care of him. Till now no one has been able to ride
me, but this child shall ride me.” Then he swallowed the boy, and when
he had done so, the cow made him many salaams, saying, “It is for this
boy’s sake that I am to die.” The next morning she was taken to the
jungle and there killed.
The beautiful boy now lived in the horse’s stomach, and he stayed in it
for one whole year. At the end of that time the horse thought, “I will
see if this child is alive or dead.” So he brought him up; and then he
loved him, and petted him, and the little prince played all about the
stable, out of which the horse was never allowed to go. Katar was very
glad to see the child, who was now four years old. After he had played
for some time, the horse swallowed him again. At the end of another
year, when the boy was five years old, Katar brought him up again,
caressed him, loved him, and let him play about the stable as he had
done a year before. Then the horse swallowed him again.
But this time the groom had seen all that happened, and when it was
morning, and the King had gone away to his hunting, he went to the four
wicked Queens, and told them all he had seen, and all about the
wonderful, beautiful child that lived inside the King’s horse Katar. On
hearing the groom’s story the four Queens cried, and tore their hair
and clothes, and refused to eat. When the King returned at evening and
asked them why they were so miserable, they said, “Your horse Katar
came and tore our clothes, and upset all our things, and we ran away
for fear he should kill us.”
“Never mind,” said the King. “Only eat your dinner and be happy. I will
have Katar shot to-morrow.” Then he thought that two men unaided could
not kill such a wicked horse, so he ordered his servants to bid his
troop of sepoys shoot him.
So the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the stable, and he
took up his stand with them; and he said he would himself shoot any one
who let his horse escape.
Meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So he brought up
the child and said to him, “Go into that little room that leads out of
the stable, and you will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must
put on me. Then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such
as princes wear; these you must put on yourself; and you must take the
sword and gun you will find there too. Then you must mount on my back."
Now Katar was a fairy-horse, and came from the fairies’ country, so he
could get anything he wanted; but neither the King nor any of his
people knew this.
When all was ready, Katar burst out of his stable, with the prince on
his back, rushed past the King himself before the King had time to
shoot him, galloped away to the great jungle-plain, and galloped about
all over it. The King saw his horse had a boy on his back, though he
could not see the boy distinctly. The sepoys tried in vain to shoot the
horse; he galloped much too fast; and at last they were all scattered
over the plain. Then the King had to give it up and go home; and the
sepoys went to their homes. The King could not shoot any of his sepoys
for letting his horse escape, for he himself had let him do so.
Then Katar galloped away, on, and on, and on; and when night came they
stayed under a tree, he and the King’s son. The horse ate grass, and
the boy wild fruits which he found in the jungle. Next morning they
started afresh, and went far, and far, till they came to a jungle in
another country, which did not belong to the little prince’s father,
but to another king. Here Katar said to the boy, “Now get off my back."
Off jumped the prince. “Unsaddle me and take off my bridle; take off
your beautiful clothes and tie them all up in a bundle with your sword
and gun.” This the boy did. Then the horse gave him some poor, common
clothes, which he told him to put on. As soon as he was dressed in them
the horse said, “Hide your bundle in this grass, and I will take care
of it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain, so that when
you want me you will always find me. You must now go away and find
service with some one in this country.”
This made the boy very sad. “I know nothing about anything,” he said.
“What shall I do all alone in this country?”
“Do not be afraid,” answered Katar. “You will find service, and I will
always stay here to help you when you want me. So go, only before you
go, twist my right ear.” The boy did so, and his horse instantly became
a donkey. “Now twist your right ear,” said Katar. And when the boy had
twisted it, he was no longer a handsome prince, but a poor, common-
looking, ugly man; and his moon and star were hidden.
Then he went away further into the country, until he came to a grain
merchant of the country, who asked him who he was. “I am a poor man,"
answered the boy, “and I want service.” “Good,” said the grain
merchant, “you shall be my servant.”
Now the grain merchant lived near the King’s palace, and one night at
twelve o’clock the boy was very hot; so he went out into the King’s
cool garden, and began to sing a lovely song. The seventh and youngest
daughter of the King heard him, and she wondered who it was who could
sing so deliciously. Then she put on her clothes, rolled up her hair,
and came down to where the seemingly poor common man was lying singing.
“Who are you? where do you come from?” she asked.
But he answered nothing.
“Who is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?” thought the
little princess, and she went away. On the second night the same thing
happened, and on the third night too. But on the third night, when she
found she could not make him answer her, she said to him, “What a
strange man you are not to answer me when I speak to you.” But still he
remained silent, so she went away.
The next day, when he had finished his work, the young prince went to
the jungle to see his horse, who asked him, “Are you quite well and
happy?” “Yes, I am,” answered the boy. “I am servant to a grain
merchant. The last three nights I have gone into the King’s garden and
sung a song, and each night the youngest princess has come to me and
asked me who I am, and whence I came, and I have answered nothing. What
shall I do now?” The horse said, “Next time she asks you who you are,
tell her you are a very poor man, and came from your own country to
find service here.”
The boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at night, when every
one had gone to bed, he went to the King’s garden and sang his sweet
song again. The youngest princess heard him, got up, dressed, and came
to him. “Who are you? Whence do you come?” she asked.
“I am a very poor man,” he answered. “I came from my own country to
seek service here, and I am now one of the grain merchant’s servants."
Then she went away. For three more nights the boy sang in the King’s
garden, and each night the princess came and asked him the same
questions as before, and the boy gave her the same answers.
Then she went to her father, and said to him, “Father, I wish to be
married; but I must choose my husband myself.” Her father consented to
this, and he wrote and invited all the Kings and Rajas in the land,
saying, “My youngest daughter wishes to be married, but she insists on
choosing her husband herself. As I do not know who it is she wishes to
marry, I beg you will all come on a certain day, for her to see you and
make her choice.”
A great many Kings, Rajas, and their sons accepted this invitation and
came. When they had all arrived, the little princess’s father said to
them, “To-morrow morning you must all sit together in my garden” (the
King’s garden was very large), “for then my youngest daughter will come
and see you all, and choose her husband. I do not know whom she will
choose.”
The youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the
next morning, and when the morning came, and all was ready, she dressed
herself in the most lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful jewels;
then she mounted her elephant, which was painted blue. In her hand she
took a gold necklace.
Then she went into the garden where the Kings, Rajas, and their sons
were seated. The boy, the grain merchant’s servant, was also in the
garden: not as a suitor, but looking on with the other servants.
The princess rode all round the garden, and looked at all the Kings and
Rajas and princes, and then she hung the gold necklace round the neck
of the boy, the grain merchant’s servant. At this everybody laughed,
and the Kings were greatly astonished. But then they and the Rajas
said, “What fooling is this?” and they pushed the pretended poor man
away, and took the necklace off his neck, and said to him, “Get out of
the way, you poor, dirty man. Your clothes are far too dirty for you to
come near us!” The boy went far away from them, and stood a long way
off to see what would happen.
Then the King’s youngest daughter went all round the garagain, holding
her gold necklace in her hand, and once more she hung it round the
boy’s neck. Every one laughed at her and said, “How can the King’s
daughter think of marrying this poor, common man!” and the Kings and
the Rajas, who had come as suitors, all wanted to turn him out of the
garden. But the princess said, “Take care! take care! You must not turn
him out. Leave him alone.” Then she put him on her elephant, and took
him to the palace.
The Kings and Rajas and their sons were very much astonished, and said,
“What does this mean? The princess does not care to marry one of us,
but chooses that very poor man!” Her father then stood up, and said to
them all, “I promised my daughter she should marry any one she pleased,
and as she has twice chosen that poor, common man, she shall marry
him.” And so the princess and the boy were married with great pomp and
splendour: her father and mother were quite content with her choice;
and the Kings, the Rajas and their sons, all returned to their homes.
Now the princess’s six sisters had all married rich princes, and they
laughed at her for choosing such a poor ugly husband as hers seemed to
be, and said to each other, mockingly, “See! our sister has married
this poor, common man!” Their six husbands used to go out hunting every
day, and every evening they brought home quantities of all kinds of
game to their wives, and the game was cooked for their dinner and for
the King’s; but the husband of the youngest princess always stayed at
home in the palace, and never went out hunting at all. This made her
very sad, and she said to herself, “My sisters’ husbands hunt every
day, but my husband never hunts at all.”
At last she said to him, “Why do you never go out hunting as my
sisters’ husbands do every day, and every day they bring home
quantities of all kinds of game? Why do you always stay at home,
instead of doing as they do?”
One day he said to her, “I am going out to-day to eat the air.”
“Very good,” she answered; “go, and take one of the horses.”
“No,” said the young prince, “I will not ride, I will walk.” Then he
went to the jungle-plain where he had left Katar, who all this time had
seemed to be a donkey, and he told Katar everything. “Listen,” he said;
“I have married the youngest princess; and when we were married
everybody laughed at her for choosing me, and said, ’What a very poor,
common man our princess has chosen for her husband!’ Besides, my wife
is very sad, for her six sisters’ husbands all hunt every day, and
bring home quantities of game, and their wives therefore are very proud
of them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt. To-day I should
like to hunt very much.”
“Well,” said Katar, “then twist my left ear;” and as soon as the boy
had twisted it, Katar was a horse again, and not a donkey any longer.
“Now,” said Katar, “twist your left ear, and you will see what a
beautiful young prince you will become.” So the boy twisted his own
left ear, and there he stood no longer a poor, common, ugly man, but a
grand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.
Then he put on his splendid clothes, saddled and bridled Katar, got on
his back with his sword and gun, and rode off to hunt.
He rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer.
That day his six brothers-in-law could find no game, for the beautiful
young prince had shot it all. Nearly all the day long these six princes
wandered about looking in vain for game; till at last they grew hungry
and thirsty, and could find no water, and they had no food with them.
Meanwhile the beautiful young prince had sat down under a tree, to dine
and rest, and there his six brothers-in-law found him. By his side was
some delicious water, and also some roast meat.
When they saw him the six princes said to each other, “Look at that
handsome prince. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.
We have never seen such a prince in this jungle before; he must come
from another country.” Then they came up to him, and made him many
salaams, and begged him to give them some food and water. “Who are
you?” said the young prince. “We are the husbands of the six elder
daughters of the King of this country,” they answered; “and we have
hunted all day, and are very hungry and thirsty.” They did not
recognise their brother-in-law in the least.
“Well,” said the young prince, “I will give you something to eat and
drink if you will do as I bid you.” “We will do all you tell us to do,"
they answered, “for if we do not get water to drink, we shall die."
“Very good,” said the young prince. “Now you must let me put a red-hot
pice on the back of each of you, and then I will give you food and
water. Do you agree to this?” The six princes consented, for they
thought, “No one will ever see the mark of the pice, as it will be
covered by our clothes; and we shall die if we have no water to drink."
Then the young prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in the fire;
he laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave them good
food and water. They ate and drank; and when they had finished they
made him many salaams and went home.
The young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening; then he
mounted his horse and rode off to the King’s palace. All the people
looked at him as he came riding along, saying, “What a splendid young
prince that is! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin."
But no one recognised him. When he came near the King’s palace, all the
King’s servants asked him who he was; and as none of them knew him, the
gate-keepers would not let him pass in. They all wondered who he could
be, and all thought him the most beautiful prince that had ever been
seen.
At last they asked him who he was. “I am the husband of your youngest
princess,” he answered.
“No, no, indeed you are not,” they said; “for he is a poor, common-
looking, and ugly man.”
“But I am he,” answered the prince; only no one would believe him.
“Tell us the truth,” said the servants; “who are you?”
“Perhaps you cannot recognise me,” said the young prince, “but call the
youngest princess here. I wish to speak to her.” The servants called
her, and she came. “That man is not my husband,” she said at once. “My
husband is not nearly as handsome as that man. This must be a prince
from another country.”
Then she said to him, “Who are you? Why do you say you are my husband?”
“Because I am your husband. I am telling you the truth,” answered the
young prince.
“No you are not, you are not telling me the truth,” said the little
princess. “My husband is not a handsome man like you. I married a very
poor, common-looking man.”
“That is true,” he answered, “but nevertheless I am your husband. I was
the grain merchant’s servant; and one hot night I went into your
father’s garden and sang, and you heard me, and came and asked me who I
was and where I came from, and I would not answer you. And the same
thing happened the next night, and the next, and on the fourth I told
you I was a very poor man, and had come from my country to seek service
in yours, and that I was the grain merchant’s servant. Then you told
your father you wished to marry, but must choose your own husband; and
when all the Kings and Rajas were seated in your father’s garden, you
sat on an elephant and went round and looked at them all; and then
twice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and chose me. See, here is
your necklace, and here are the ring and the handkerchief you gave me
on our wedding day.”
Then she believed him, and was very glad that her husband was such a
beautiful young prince. “What a strange man you are!” she said to him.
“Till now you have been poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now you are
beautiful and look like a prince; I never saw such a handsome man as
you are before; and yet I know you must be my husband.” Then she
worshipped God and thanked him for letting her have such a husband. “I
have,” she said, “a beautiful husband. There is no one like him in this
country. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.” Then
she took him into the palace, and showed him to her father and mother
and to every one. They all said they had never seen any one like him,
and were all very happy. And the young prince lived as before in the
King’s palace with his wife, and Katar lived in the King’s stables.
One day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were in his court-
house, and it was full of people, the young prince said to him, “There
are six thieves here in your court-house.” “Six thieves!” said the
King. “Where are they? Show them to me.” “There they are,” said the
young prince, pointing to his six brothers-in-law. The King and every
one else in the court-house were very much astonished, and would not
believe the young prince. “Take off their coats,” he said, “and then
you will see for yourselves that each of them has the mark of a thief
on his back.” So their coats were taken off the six princes, and the
King and everybody in the court-house saw the mark of the red-hot pice.
The six princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince was very
glad. He had not forgotten how his brothers-in-law had laughed at him
and mocked him when he seemed a poor, common man.
Now, when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince was married,
he had told the boy the whole story of his birth, and all that had
happened to him and his mother. “When you are married,” he said to him,
“I will take you back to your father’s country.” So two months after
the young prince had revenged himself on his brothers-in-law, Katar
said to him, “It is time for you to return to your father. Get the King
to let you go to your own country, and I will tell you what to do when
we get there.”
The prince always did what his horse told him to do; so he went to his
wife and said to her, “I wish very much to go to my own country to see
my father and mother.” “Very well,” said his wife; “I will tell my
father and mother, and ask them to let us go.” Then she went to them,
and told them, and they consented to let her and her husband leave
them. The King gave his daughter and the young prince a great many
horses, and elephants, and all sorts of presents, and also a great many
sepoys to guard them. In this grand state they travelled to the
prince’s country, which was not a great many miles off. When they
reached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the
prince had been left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Suri
had swallowed him so often.
When the King, his father, the gardener’s daughter’s husband, saw the
prince’s camp, he was very much alarmed, and thought a great King had
come to make war on him. He sent one of his servants, therefore, to ask
whose camp it was. The young prince then wrote him a letter, in which
he said, “You are a great King. Do not fear me. I am not come to make
war on you. I am as if I were your son. I am a prince who has come to
see your country and to speak with you. I wish to give you a grand
feast, to which every one in your country must come–men and women, old
and young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children, fakirs, and
sepoys. You must bring them all here to me for a week, and I will feast
them all.”
The King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all the men,
women, and children of all castes, fakirs, and sepoys, in his country
to go to the prince’s camp to a grand feast the prince would give them.
So they all came, and the King brought his four wives too. All came, at
least all but the gardener’s daughter. No one had told her to go to the
feast, for no one had thought of her.
When all the people were assembled, the prince saw his mother was not
there, and he asked the King, “Has every one in your country come to my
feast?”
“Yes, every one,” said the King.
“Are you sure of that?” asked the prince.
“Quite sure,” answered the King.
“I am sure one woman has not come,” said the prince. “She is your
gardener’s daughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in
your palace.”
“True,” said the King, “I had forgotten her.” Then the prince told his
servants to take his finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener’s
daughter. They were to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and
handsome jewels, and then bring her to him in the palanquin.
While the servants were bringing the gardener’s daughter, the King
thought how handsome the young prince was; and he noticed particularly
the moon on his forehead and the star on his chin, and he wondered in
what country the young prince was born.
And now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener’s daughter, and the
young prince went himself and took her out of it, and brought her into
the tent. He made her a great many salaams. The four wicked wives
looked on and were very much surprised and very angry. They remembered
that, when they arrived, the prince had made them no salaams, and since
then had not taken the least notice of them; whereas he could not do
enough for the gardener’s daughter, and seemed very glad to see her.
When they were all at dinner, the prince again made the gardener’s
daughter a great many salaams, and gave her food from all the nicest
dishes. She wondered at his kindness to her, and thought, “Who is this
handsome prince, with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin? I
never saw any one so beautiful. What country does he come from?”
Two or three days were thus passed in feasting, and all that time the
King and his people were talking about the prince’s beauty, and
wondering who he was.
One day the prince asked the King if he had any children. “None,” he
answered.
“Do you know who I am?” asked the prince.
“No,” said the King. “Tell me who you are.”
“I am your son,” answered the prince, “and the gardener’s daughter is
my mother.”
The King shook his head sadly. “How can you be my son,” he said, “when
I have never had any children?”
“But I am your son,” answered the prince. “Your four wicked Queens told
you the gardener’s daughter had given you a stone and not a son; but it
was they who put the stone in my little bed, and then they tried to
kill me.”
The King did not believe him. “I wish you were my son,” he said; “but as
I never had a child, you cannot be my son.” “Do you remember your dog
Shankar, and how you had him killed? And do you remember your cow Suri,
and how you had her killed too? Your wives made you kill them because
of me. And,” he said, taking the King to Katar, “do you know whose
horse that is?”
The King looked at Katar, and then said, “That is my horse, Katar."
“Yes,” said the prince. “Do you not remember how he rushed past you out
of his stable with me on his back?” Then Katar told the King the prince
was really his son, and told him all the story of his birth, and of his
life up to that moment; and when the King found the beautiful prince
was indeed his son, he was so glad, so glad. He put his arms round him
and kissed him and cried for joy.
“Now,” said the King, “you must come with me to my palace, and live
with me always.”
“No,” said the prince, “that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace. I
only came here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I
will take her with me to my father-in-law’s palace. I have married a
King’s daughter, and we live with her father.”
“But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go,” said his father.
You and your wife must come and live with your mother and me in my
palace.”
“That we will never do,” said the prince, “unless you will kill your
four wicked Queens with your own hand. If you will do that, we will
come and live with you.”
So the King killed his Queens, and then he and his wife, the gardener’s
daughter, and the prince and his wife, all went to live in the King’s
palace, and lived there happily together for ever after; and the King
thanked God for giving him such a beautiful son, and for ridding him of
his four wicked wives.
Katar did not return to the fairies’ country, but stayed always with
the young prince, and never left him.
