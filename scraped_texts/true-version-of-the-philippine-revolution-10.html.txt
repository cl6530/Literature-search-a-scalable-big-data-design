In a few days the Spanish steamer Compania de Filipinas was
brought to Cavite by my countrymen, who captured her in the harbour
of Aparri. Cannon were at once mounted on board this vessel and she
was loaded with troops and despatched for Olongapo, but she had not
gone far before I sent another gunboat to recall her because Admiral
Dewey requested me to do so in order that a question raised by the
French Consul might be duly settled. The Admiral having been informed
that when captured the Compania de Filipinas was flying the Spanish
flag abstained from interfering in the matter and handed the French
Consul’s protest over to me, affirming at the same time that he and
his forces were in no way concerned in the matter.
This incident, which was soon settled, clearly demonstrates the
recognition of and protection extended to the Philippine Revolution
by Admiral Dewey.
The Filipinas (as this steamer has since been styled) was again
despatched to Olongapo and on her way back landed troops in the
provinces of Cagayan and the Batanes islands for the purpose of
wresting the government of those districts from Spain. This steamer,
whose name has more recently been changed to Luzon, is at present
ashore in the Rio Grande, in Cagayan, where she was beached owing to
some damage to her machinery.
When our steamers were leaving the harbour with troops for the
provinces they dipped their ensigns in passing Admiral Dewey’s
flagship Olympia, performing this act in conformity with the rules
of international courtesy, a demonstration of friendship that was
invariably promptly responded to in the usual way.
