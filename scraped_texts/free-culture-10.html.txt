William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet in 1595. The play was first 
published in 1597. It was the eleventh major play that Shakespeare had written. 
He would continue to write plays through 1613, and the plays that he wrote have 
continued to define Anglo-American culture ever since. So deeply have the works 
of a sixteenth-century writer seeped into our culture that we often don’t even 
recognize their source. I once overheard someone commenting on Kenneth Branagh’s 
adaptation of Henry V: I liked it, but Shakespeare is so full of clichés.
In 1774, almost 180 years after Romeo and Juliet was written, the copy-right 
for the work was still thought by many to be the exclusive right of a single 
London publisher, Jacob Tonson. [1] Tonson was the most prominent of a small 
group of publishers called the Conger [2] who controlled bookselling in England 
during the eighteenth century. The Conger claimed a perpetual right to control 
the copy of books that they had acquired from authors. That perpetual right 
meant that no one else could publish copies of a book to which they held the 
copyright. Prices of the classics were thus kept high; competition to produce 
better or cheaper editions was eliminated.
Now, there’s something puzzling about the year 1774 to anyone who knows a little 
about copyright law. The better-known year in the history of copyright is 1710, 
the year that the British Parliament adopted the first copyright act. Known as 
the Statute of Anne, the act stated that all published works would get a 
copyright term of fourteen years, renewable once if the author was alive, and 
that all works already published by 1710 would get a single term of twenty-one 
additional years. [3] Under this law, Romeo and Juliet should have been free 
in 1731. So why was there any issue about it still being under Tonson’s control 
in 1774?
The reason is that the English hadn’t yet agreed on what a copy-right was
indeed, no one had. At the time the English passed the Statute of Anne, there 
was no other legislation governing copyrights. The last law regulating 
publishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had expired in 1695. That law gave 
publishers a monopoly over publishing, as a way to make it easier for the Crown 
to control what was published. But after it expired, there was no positive law 
that said that the publishers, or Stationers, had an exclusive right to print 
books.
There was no positive law, but that didn’t mean that there was no law. The 
Anglo-American legal tradition looks to both the words of legislatures and the 
words of judges to know the rules that are to govern how people are to behave. 
We call the words from legislatures positive law. We call the words from 
judges common law. The common law sets the background against which 
legislatures legislate; the legislature, ordinarily, can trump that background 
only if it passes a law to displace it. And so the real question after the 
licensing statutes had expired was whether the common law protected a copyright, 
independent of any positive law.
This question was important to the publishers, or booksellers, as they were 
called, because there was growing competition from foreign publishers. The 
Scottish, in particular, were increasingly publishing and exporting books to 
England. That competition reduced the profits of the Conger, which reacted by 
demanding that Parliament pass a law to again give them exclusive control over 
publishing. That demand ultimately resulted in the Statute of Anne.
The Statute of Anne granted the author or proprietor of a book an exclusive 
right to print that book. In an important limitation, however, and to the horror 
of the booksellers, the law gave the bookseller that right for a limited term. 
At the end of that term, the copyright expired, and the work would then be 
free and could be published by anyone. Or so the legislature is thought to have 
believed.
Now, the thing to puzzle about for a moment is this: Why would Parliament limit 
the exclusive right? Not why would they limit it to the particular limit they 
set, but why would they limit the right at all?
For the booksellers, and the authors whom they represented, had a very strong 
claim. Take Romeo and Juliet as an example: That play was written by 
Shakespeare. It was his genius that brought it into the world. He didn’t take 
anybody’s property when he created this play (that’s a controversial claim, but 
never mind), and by his creating this play, he didn’t make it any harder for 
others to craft a play. So why is it that the law would ever allow someone else 
to come along and take Shakespeare’s play without his, or his estate’s, 
permission? What reason is there to allow someone else to steal Shakespeare’s 
work?
The answer comes in two parts. We first need to see something special about the 
notion of copyright that existed at the time of the Statute of Anne. Second, 
we have to see something important about booksellers.
First, about copyright. In the last three hundred years, we have come to apply 
the concept of copyright ever more broadly. But in 1710, it wasn’t so much a 
concept as it was a very particular right. The copyright was born as a very 
specific set of restrictions: It forbade others from reprinting a book. In 1710, 
the copy-right was a right to use a particular machine to replicate a 
particular work. It did not go beyond that very narrow right. It did not control 
any more generally how a work could be used. Today the right includes a large 
collection of restrictions on the freedom of others: It grants the author the 
exclusive right to copy, the exclusive right to distribute, the exclusive right 
to perform, and so on.
So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare’s works were perpetual, 
all that would have meant under the original meaning of the term was that no one 
could reprint Shakespeare’s work without the permission of the Shakespeare 
estate. It would not have controlled anything, for example, about how the work 
could be performed, whether the work could be translated, or whether Kenneth 
Branagh would be allowed to make his films. The copy-right was only an 
exclusive right to printno less, of course, but also no more.
Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British. They had had 
a long and ugly experience with exclusive rights, especially exclusive 
rights granted by the Crown. The English had fought a civil war in part about 
the Crown’s practice of handing out monopoliesespecially monopolies for works 
that already existed. King Henry VIII granted a patent to print the Bible and a 
monopoly to Darcy to print playing cards. The English Parliament began to fight 
back against this power of the Crown. In 1656, it passed the Statute of 
Monopolies, limiting monopolies to patents for new inventions. And by 1710, 
Parliament was eager to deal with the growing monopoly in publishing.
Thus the copy-right, when viewed as a monopoly right, was naturally viewed as 
a right that should be limited. (However convincing the claim that it’s my 
property, and I should have it forever, try sounding convincing when uttering, 
It’s my monopoly, and I should have it forever.) The state would protect the 
exclusive right, but only so long as it benefited society. The British saw the 
harms from special-interest favors; they passed a law to stop them.
Second, about booksellers. It wasn’t just that the copyright was a monopoly. It 
was also that it was a monopoly held by the booksellers. Booksellers sound 
quaint and harmless to us. They were not viewed as harmless in seventeenth-
century England. Members of the Conger were increasingly seen as monopolists of 
the worst kindtools of the Crown’s repression, selling the liberty of England 
to guarantee themselves a monopoly profit. The attacks against these monopolists 
were harsh: Milton described them as old patentees and monopolizers in the 
trade of book-selling; they were men who do not therefore labour in an honest 
profession to which learning is indetted. [4]
Many believed the power the booksellers exercised over the spread of knowledge 
was harming that spread, just at the time the Enlightenment was teaching the 
importance of education and knowledge spread generally. The idea that knowledge 
should be free was a hallmark of the time, and these powerful commercial 
interests were interfering with that idea.
To balance this power, Parliament decided to increase competition among 
booksellers, and the simplest way to do that was to spread the wealth of 
valuable books. Parliament therefore limited the term of copyrights, and thereby 
guaranteed that valuable books would become open to any publisher to publish 
after a limited time. Thus the setting of the term for existing works to just 
twenty-one years was a compromise to fight the power of the booksellers. The 
limitation on terms was an indirect way to assure competition among publishers, 
and thus the construction and spread of culture.
When 1731 (1710 + 21) came along, however, the booksellers were getting anxious. 
They saw the consequences of more competition, and like every competitor, they 
didn’t like them. At first booksellers simply ignored the Statute of Anne, 
continuing to insist on the perpetual right to control publication. But in 1735 
and 1737, they tried to persuade Parliament to extend their terms. Twenty-one 
years was not enough, they said; they needed more time.
Parliament rejected their requests. As one pamphleteer put it, in words that 
echo today,
I see no Reason for granting a further Term now, which will not hold as well 
for granting it again and again, as often as the Old ones Expire; so that should 
this Bill pass, it will in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly, a Thing 
deservedly odious in the Eye of the Law; it will be a great Cramp to Trade, a 
Discouragement to Learning, no Benefit to the Authors, but a general Tax on the 
Publick; and all this only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers. [5]
Having failed in Parliament, the publishers turned to the courts in a series of 
cases. Their argument was simple and direct: The Statute of Anne gave authors 
certain protections through positive law, but those protections were not 
intended as replacements for the common law. Instead, they were intended simply 
to supplement the common law. Under common law, it was already wrong to take 
another person’s creative property and use it without his permission. The 
Statute of Anne, the booksellers argued, didn’t change that. Therefore, just 
because the protections of the Statute of Anne expired, that didn’t mean the 
protections of the common law expired: Under the common law they had the right 
to ban the publication of a book, even if its Statute of Anne copyright had 
expired. This, they argued, was the only way to protect authors.
This was a clever argument, and one that had the support of some of the leading 
jurists of the day. It also displayed extraordinary chutzpah. Until then, as law 
professor Raymond Patterson has put it, The publishers ... had as much concern 
for authors as a cattle rancher has for cattle. [6] The bookseller didn’t care 
squat for the rights of the author. His concern was the monopoly profit that the 
author’s work gave.
The booksellers’ argument was not accepted without a fight. The hero of this 
fight was a Scottish bookseller named Alexander Donaldson. [7]
Donaldson was an outsider to the London Conger. He began his career in Edinburgh 
in 1750. The focus of his business was inexpensive reprints of standard works 
whose copyright term had expired, at least under the Statute of Anne. [8] 
Donaldson’s publishing house prospered and became something of a center for 
literary Scotsmen. [A]mong them, Professor Mark Rose writes, was the young 
James Boswell who, together with his friend Andrew Erskine, published an 
anthology of contemporary Scottish poems with Donaldson. [9]
When the London booksellers tried to shut down Donaldson’s shop in Scotland, he 
responded by moving his shop to London, where he sold inexpensive editions of 
the most popular English books, in defiance of the supposed common law right of 
Literary Property. [10] His books undercut the Conger prices by 30 to 50 
percent, and he rested his right to compete upon the ground that, under the 
Statute of Anne, the works he was selling had passed out of protection.
The London booksellers quickly brought suit to block piracy like Donaldson’s. 
A number of actions were successful against the pirates, the most important 
early victory being Millar v. Taylor.
Millar was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the rights to James Thomson’s 
poem The Seasons. Millar complied with the requirements of the Statute of 
Anne, and therefore received the full protection of the statute. After the term 
of copyright ended, Robert Taylor began printing a competing volume. Millar 
sued, claiming a perpetual common law right, the Statute of Anne 
notwithstanding. [11]
Astonishingly to modern lawyers, one of the greatest judges in English history, 
Lord Mansfield, agreed with the booksellers. Whatever protection the Statute of 
Anne gave booksellers, it did not, he held, extinguish any common law right. The 
question was whether the common law would protect the author against subsequent 
pirates. Mansfield’s answer was yes: The common law would bar Taylor from 
reprinting Thomson’s poem without Millar’s permission. That common law rule thus 
effectively gave the booksellers a perpetual right to control the publication of 
any book assigned to them.
Considered as a matter of abstract justicereasoning as if justice were just a 
matter of logical deduction from first principlesMansfield’s conclusion might 
make some sense. But what it ignored was the larger issue that Parliament had 
struggled with in 1710: How best to limit the monopoly power of publishers? 
Parliament’s strategy was to offer a term for existing works that was long 
enough to buy peace in 1710, but short enough to assure that culture would pass 
into competition within a reasonable period of time. Within twenty-one years, 
Parliament believed, Britain would mature from the controlled culture that the 
Crown coveted to the free culture that we inherited.
The fight to defend the limits of the Statute of Anne was not to end there, 
however, and it is here that Donaldson enters the mix.
Millar died soon after his victory, so his case was not appealed. His estate 
sold Thomson’s poems to a syndicate of printers that included Thomas Beckett. 
[12] Donaldson then released an unauthorized edition of Thomson’s works. 
Beckett, on the strength of the decision in Millar, got an injunction against 
Donaldson. Donaldson appealed the case to the House of Lords, which functioned 
much like our own Supreme Court. In February of 1774, that body had the chance 
to interpret the meaning of Parliament’s limits from sixty years before.
As few legal cases ever do, Donaldson v. Beckett drew an enormous amount of 
attention throughout Britain. Donaldson’s lawyers argued that whatever rights 
may have existed under the common law, the Statute of Anne terminated those 
rights. After passage of the Statute of Anne, the only legal protection for an 
exclusive right to control publication came from that statute. Thus, they 
argued, after the term specified in the Statute of Anne expired, works that had 
been protected by the statute were no longer protected.
The House of Lords was an odd institution. Legal questions were presented to the 
House and voted upon first by the law lords, members of special legal 
distinction who functioned much like the Justices in our Supreme Court. Then, 
after the law lords voted, the House of Lords generally voted.
The reports about the law lords’ votes are mixed. On some counts, it looks as if 
perpetual copyright prevailed. But there is no ambiguity about how the House of 
Lords voted as whole. By a two-to-one majority (22 to 11) they voted to reject 
the idea of perpetual copyrights. Whatever one’s understanding of the common 
law, now a copyright was fixed for a limited time, after which the work 
protected by copyright passed into the public domain.
The public domain. Before the case of Donaldson v. Beckett, there was no 
clear idea of a public domain in England. Before 1774, there was a strong 
argument that common law copyrights were perpetual. After 1774, the public 
domain was born. For the first time in Anglo- American history, the legal 
control over creative works expired, and the greatest works in English history
including those of Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Johnson, and Bunyanwere free of 
legal restraint.
It is hard for us to imagine, but this decision by the House of Lords fueled an 
extraordinarily popular and political reaction. In Scotland, where most of the 
pirate publishers did their work, people celebrated the decision in the 
streets. As the Edinburgh Advertiser reported, No private cause has so much 
engrossed the attention of the public, and none has been tried before the House 
of Lords in the decision of which so many individuals were interested. Great 
rejoicing in Edinburgh upon victory over literary property: bonfires and 
illuminations. [13]
In London, however, at least among publishers, the reaction was equally strong 
in the opposite direction. The Morning Chronicle reported:
By the above decision ... near 200,000 pounds worth of what was honestly 
purchased at public sale, and which was yesterday thought property is now 
reduced to nothing. The Booksellers of London and Westminster, many of whom sold 
estates and houses to purchase Copy-right, are in a manner ruined, and those who 
after many years industry thought they had acquired a competency to provide for 
their families now find themselves without a shilling to devise to their 
successors. [14]
 
Ruined is a bit of an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration to say that 
the change was profound. The decision of the House of Lords meant that the 
booksellers could no longer control how culture in England would grow and 
develop. Culture in England was thereafter free. Not in the sense that 
copyrights would not be respected, for of course, for a limited time after a 
work was published, the bookseller had an exclusive right to control the 
publication of that book. And not in the sense that books could be stolen, for 
even after a copyright expired, you still had to buy the book from someone. But 
/free in the sense that the culture and its growth would no longer be 
controlled by a small group of publishers. As every free market does, this free 
market of free culture would grow as the consumers and producers chose. English 
culture would develop as the many English readers chose to let it developchose 
in the books they bought and wrote; chose in the memes they repeated and 
endorsed. Chose in a competitive context, not a context in which the choices 
about what culture is available to people and how they get access to it are made 
by the few despite the wishes of the many.
At least, this was the rule in a world where the Parliament is anti-monopoly, 
resistant to the protectionist pleas of publishers. In a world where the 
Parliament is more pliant, free culture would be less protected.
