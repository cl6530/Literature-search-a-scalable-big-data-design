How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger, or my feet
meet hers under the table! I draw back as if from a furnace; but
a secret force impels me forward again, and my senses become
disordered. Her innocent, unconscious heart never knows what agony
these little familiarities inflict upon me. Sometimes when we
are talking she Iays her hand upon mine, and in the eagerness of
conversation comes closer to me, and her balmy breath reaches my
lips, — when I feel as if lightning had struck me, and that I
could sink into the earth. And yet, Wilhelm, with all this heavenly
confidence, — if I know myself, and should ever dare — you
understand me. No, no! my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak,
weak enough but is not that a degree of corruption?
She is to me a sacred being. All passion is still in her presence:
I cannot express my sensations when I am near her. I feel as if
my soul beat in every nerve of my body. There is a melody which
she plays on the piano with angelic skill, — so simple is it,
and yet so spiritual! It is her favourite air; and, when she
plays the first note, all pain, care, and sorrow disappear from
me in a moment.
I believe every word that is said of the magic of ancient music.
How her simple song enchants me! Sometimes, when I am ready to
commit suicide, she sings that air; and instantly the gloom and
madness which hung over me are dispersed, and I breathe freely
again.
