In 1928, a cartoon character was born. An early Mickey Mouse made his debut in 
May of that year, in a silent flop called Plane Crazy. In November, in New 
York City’s Colony Theater, in the first widely distributed cartoon synchronized 
with sound, Steamboat Willie brought to life the character that would become 
Mickey Mouse.
Synchronized sound had been introduced to film a year earlier in the movie The 
Jazz Singer. That success led Walt Disney to copy the technique and mix sound 
with cartoons. No one knew whether it would work or, if it did work, whether it 
would win an audience. But when Disney ran a test in the summer of 1928, the 
results were unambiguous. As Disney describes that first experiment,
A couple of my boys could read music, and one of them could play a mouth organ. 
We put them in a room where they could not see the screen and arranged to pipe 
their sound into the room where our wives and friends were going to see the 
picture. 
The boys worked from a music and sound-effects score. After several false 
starts, sound and action got off with the gun. The mouth organist played the 
tune, the rest of us in the sound department bammed tin pans and blew slide 
whistles on the beat. The synchronization was pretty close. 
The effect on our little audience was nothing less than electric. They 
responded almost instinctively to this union of sound and motion. I thought they 
were kidding me. So they put me in the audience and ran the action again. It was 
terrible, but it was wonderful! And it was something new! [1]
Disney’s then partner, and one of animation’s most extraordinary talents, Ub 
Iwerks, put it more strongly: I have never been so thrilled in my life. Nothing 
since has ever equaled it.
Disney had created something very new, based upon something relatively new. 
Synchronized sound brought life to a form of creativity that had rarelyexcept 
in Disney’s handsbeen anything more than filler for other films. Throughout 
animation’s early history, it was Disney’s invention that set the standard that 
others struggled to match. And quite often, Disney’s great genius, his spark of 
creativity, was built upon the work of others.
This much is familiar. What you might not know is that 1928 also marks another 
important transition. In that year, a comic (as opposed to cartoon) genius 
created his last independently produced silent film. That genius was Buster 
Keaton. The film was Steamboat Bill, Jr.
Keaton was born into a vaudeville family in 1895. In the era of silent film, he 
had mastered using broad physical comedy as a way to spark uncontrollable 
laughter from his audience. Steamboat Bill, Jr. was a classic of this form, 
famous among film buffs for its incredible stunts. The film was classic Keaton
wildly popular and among the best of its genre. 
Steamboat Bill, Jr. appeared before Disney’s cartoon Steamboat Willie. The 
coincidence of titles is not coincidental. Steamboat Willie is a direct cartoon 
parody of Steamboat Bill, [2] and both are built upon a common song as a source. 
It is not just from the invention of synchronized sound in The Jazz Singer 
that we get Steamboat Willie. It is also from Buster Keaton’s invention of 
Steamboat Bill, Jr., itself inspired by the song Steamboat Bill, that we get 
Steamboat Willie, and then from Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse.
This borrowing was nothing unique, either for Disney or for the industry. 
Disney was always parroting the feature-length mainstream films of his day. [3] 
So did many others. Early cartoons are filled with knockoffsslight variations 
on winning themes; retellings of ancient stories. The key to success was the 
brilliance of the differences. With Disney, it was sound that gave his animation 
its spark. Later, it was the quality of his work relative to the production-line 
cartoons with which he competed. Yet these additions were built upon a base that 
was borrowed. Disney added to the work of others before him, creating something 
new out of something just barely old.
Sometimes this borrowing was slight. Sometimes it was significant. Think about 
the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. If you’re as oblivious as I was, you’re 
likely to think that these tales are happy, sweet stories, appropriate for any 
child at bedtime. In fact, the Grimm fairy tales are, well, for us, grim. It is 
a rare and perhaps overly ambitious parent who would dare to read these bloody, 
moralistic stories to his or her child, at bedtime or anytime.
Disney took these stories and retold them in a way that carried them into a new 
age. He animated the stories, with both characters and light. Without removing 
the elements of fear and danger altogether, he made funny what was dark and 
injected a genuine emotion of compassion where before there was fear. And not 
just with the work of the Brothers Grimm. Indeed, the catalog of Disney work 
drawing upon the work of others is astonishing when set together: Snow White 
(1937), Fantasia (1940), Pinocchio (1940), Dumbo (1941), Bambi (1942), 
/Song of the South (1946), Cinderella (1950), Alice in Wonderland (1951), 
/Robin Hood (1952), Peter Pan (1953), Lady and the Tramp (1955), Mulan 
(1998), Sleeping Beauty (1959), 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the 
Stone (1963), and The Jungle Book (1967)not to mention a recent example that 
we should perhaps quickly forget, Treasure Planet (2003). In all of these 
cases, Disney (or Disney, Inc.) ripped creativity from the culture around him, 
mixed that creativity with his own extraordinary talent, and then burned that 
mix into the soul of his culture. Rip, mix, and burn.
This is a kind of creativity. It is a creativity that we should remember and 
celebrate. There are some who would say that there is no creativity except this 
kind. We don’t need to go that far to recognize its importance. We could call 
this Disney creativity, though that would be a bit misleading. It is, more 
precisely, Walt Disney creativitya form of expression and genius that builds 
upon the culture around us and makes it something different. 
In 1928, the culture that Disney was free to draw upon was relatively fresh. The 
public domain in 1928 was not very old and was therefore quite vibrant. The 
average term of copyright was just around thirty yearsfor that minority of 
creative work that was in fact copy-righted.4 That means that for thirty years, 
on average, the authors or copyright holders of a creative work had an 
exclusive right to control certain uses of the work. To use this copyrighted 
work in limited ways required the permission of the copyright owner.
At the end of a copyright term, a work passes into the public domain. No 
permission is then needed to draw upon or use that work. No permission and, 
hence, no lawyers. The public domain is a lawyer-free zone. Thus, most of the 
content from the nineteenth century was free for Disney to use and build upon in 
1928. It was free for anyone whether connected or not, whether rich or not, 
whether approved or notto use and build upon. 
This is the ways things always wereuntil quite recently. For most of our 
history, the public domain was just over the horizon. From 1790 until 1978, the 
average copyright term was never more than thirty-two years, meaning that most 
culture just a generation and a half old was free for anyone to build upon 
without the permission of anyone else. Today’s equivalent would be for creative 
work from the 1960s and 1970s to now be free for the next Walt Disney to build 
upon without permission. Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for 
content from before the Great Depression.
Of course, Walt Disney had no monopoly on Walt Disney creativity. Nor does 
America. The norm of free culture has, until recently, and except within 
totalitarian nations, been broadly exploited and quite universal.
Consider, for example, a form of creativity that seems strange to many Americans 
but that is inescapable within Japanese culture: manga, or comics. The 
Japanese are fanatics about comics. Some 40 percent of publications are comics, 
and 30 percent of publication revenue derives from comics. They are everywhere 
in Japanese society, at every magazine stand, carried by a large proportion of 
commuters on Japan’s extraordinary system of public transportation.
Americans tend to look down upon this form of culture. That’s an unattractive 
characteristic of ours. We’re likely to misunderstand much about manga, because 
few of us have ever read anything close to the stories that these graphic 
novels tell. For the Japanese, manga cover every aspect of social life. For us, 
comics are men in tights. And anyway, it’s not as if the New York subways are 
filled with readers of Joyce or even Hemingway. People of different cultures 
distract themselves in different ways, the Japanese in this interestingly 
different way.
But my purpose here is not to understand manga. It is to describe a variant on 
manga that from a lawyer’s perspective is quite odd, but from a Disney 
perspective is quite familiar.
This is the phenomenon of doujinshi. Doujinshi are also comics, but they are a 
kind of copycat comic. A rich ethic governs the creation of doujinshi. It is not 
doujinshi if it is just a copy; the artist must make a contribution to the art 
he copies, by transforming it either subtly or significantly. A doujinshi comic 
can thus take a mainstream comic and develop it differentlywith a different 
story line. Or the comic can keep the character in character but change its look 
slightly. There is no formula for what makes the doujinshi sufficiently 
different. But they must be different if they are to be considered true 
doujinshi. Indeed, there are committees that review doujinshi for inclusion 
within shows and reject any copycat comic that is merely a copy.
These copycat comics are not a tiny part of the manga market. They are huge. 
More than 33,000 circles of creators from across Japan produce these bits of 
Walt Disney creativity. More than 450,000 Japanese come together twice a year, 
in the largest public gathering in the country, to exchange and sell them. This 
market exists in parallel to the mainstream commercial manga market. In some 
ways, it obviously competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort 
by those who control the commercial manga market to shut the doujinshi market 
down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.
The most puzzling feature of the doujinshi market, for those trained in the law, 
at least, is that it is allowed to exist at all. Under Japanese copyright law, 
which in this respect (on paper) mirrors American copyright law, the doujinshi 
market is an illegal one. Doujinshi are plainly derivative works. There is no 
general practice by doujinshi artists of securing the permission of the manga 
creators. Instead, the practice is simply to take and modify the creations of 
others, as Walt Disney did with Steamboat Bill, Jr. Under both Japanese and 
American law, that taking without the permission of the original copyright 
owner is illegal. It is an infringement of the original copyright to make a copy 
or a derivative work without the original copyright owner’s permission. 
Yet this illegal market exists and indeed flourishes in Japan, and in the view 
of many, it is precisely because it exists that Japanese manga flourish. As 
American graphic novelist Judd Winick said to me, The early days of comics in 
America are very much like what’s going on in Japan now.  American comics were 
born out of copying each other. ... That’s how [the artists] learn to drawby 
going into comic books and not tracing them, but looking at them and copying 
them and building from them. [5]
American comics now are quite different, Winick explains, in part because of the 
legal difficulty of adapting comics the way doujinshi are allowed. Speaking of 
Superman, Winick told me, there are these rules and you have to stick to them. 
There are things Superman cannot do. As a creator, it’s frustrating having to 
stick to some parameters which are fifty years old. 
The norm in Japan mitigates this legal difficulty. Some say it is precisely the 
benefit accruing to the Japanese manga market that explains the mitigation. 
Temple University law professor Salil Mehra, for example, hypothesizes that the 
manga market accepts these technical violations because they spur the manga 
market to be more wealthy and productive. Everyone would be worse off if 
doujinshi were banned, so the law does not ban doujinshi. [6]
The problem with this story, however, as Mehra plainly acknowledges, is that the 
mechanism producing this laissez faire response is not clear. It may well be 
that the market as a whole is better off if doujinshi are permitted rather than 
banned, but that doesn’t explain why individual copyright owners don’t sue 
nonetheless. If the law has no general exception for doujinshi, and indeed in 
some cases individual manga artists have sued doujinshi artists, why is there 
not a more general pattern of blocking this free taking by the doujinshi 
culture?
I spent four wonderful months in Japan, and I asked this question as often as I 
could. Perhaps the best account in the end was offered by a friend from a major 
Japanese law firm. We don’t have enough lawyers, he told me one afternoon. 
There just aren’t enough resources to prosecute cases like this. 
This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a function of 
both the words on the books and the costs of making those words have effect. For 
now, focus on the obvious question that is begged: Would Japan be better off 
with more lawyers? Would manga be richer if doujinshi artists were regularly 
prosecuted? Would the Japanese gain something important if they could end this 
practice of uncompensated sharing? Does piracy here hurt the victims of the 
piracy, or does it help them? Would lawyers fighting this piracy help their 
clients or hurt them? 
Let’s pause for a moment.
If you’re like I was a decade ago, or like most people are when they first start 
thinking about these issues, then just about now you should be puzzled about 
something you hadn’t thought through before.
We live in a world that celebrates property. I am one of those celebrants. I 
believe in the value of property in general, and I also believe in the value of 
that weird form of property that lawyers call intellectual property. [7] A 
large, diverse society cannot survive without property; a large, diverse, and 
modern society cannot flourish without intellectual property.
But it takes just a second’s reflection to realize that there is plenty of value 
out there that property doesn’t capture. I don’t mean money can’t buy you 
love, but rather, value that is plainly part of a process of production, 
including commercial as well as noncommercial production. If Disney animators 
had stolen a set of pencils to draw Steamboat Willie, we’d have no hesitation in 
condemning that taking as wrongeven though trivial, even if unnoticed. Yet 
there was nothing wrong, at least under the law of the day, with Disney’s taking 
from Buster Keaton or from the Brothers Grimm. There was nothing wrong with the 
taking from Keaton because Disney’s use would have been considered fair. There 
was nothing wrong with the taking from the Grimms because the Grimms’ work was 
in the public domain.
Thus, even though the things that Disney tookor more generally, the things 
taken by anyone exercising Walt Disney creativityare valuable, our tradition 
does not treat those takings as wrong. Some things remain free for the taking 
within a free culture, and that freedom is good.
The same with the doujinshi culture. If a doujinshi artist broke into a 
publisher’s office and ran off with a thousand copies of his latest workor even 
one copywithout paying, we’d have no hesitation in saying the artist was wrong. 
In addition to having trespassed, he would have stolen something of value. The 
law bans that stealing in whatever form, whether large or small.
Yet there is an obvious reluctance, even among Japanese lawyers, to say that the 
copycat comic artists are stealing. This form of Walt Disney creativity is 
seen as fair and right, even if lawyers in particular find it hard to say why.
It’s the same with a thousand examples that appear everywhere once you begin to 
look. Scientists build upon the work of other scientists without asking or 
paying for the privilege. (Excuse me, Professor Einstein, but may I have 
permission to use your theory of relativity to show that you were wrong about 
quantum physics?) Acting companies perform adaptations of the works of 
Shakespeare without securing permission from anyone. (Does anyone believe 
Shakespeare would be better spread within our culture if there were a central 
Shakespeare rights clearinghouse that all productions of Shakespeare must appeal 
to first?) And Hollywood goes through cycles with a certain kind of movie: five 
asteroid films in the late 1990s; two volcano disaster films in 1997.
Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the 
creativity that went before and that surrounds them now. That building is always 
and everywhere at least partially done without permission and without 
compensating the original creator. No society, free or controlled, has ever 
demanded that every use be paid for or that permission for Walt Disney 
creativity must always be sought. Instead, every society has left a certain bit 
of its culture free for the takingfree societies more fully than unfree, 
perhaps, but all societies to some degree.
The hard question is therefore not whether a culture is free. All cultures are 
free to some degree. The hard question instead is /How free is this culture? 
How much, and how broadly, is the culture free for others to take and build 
upon? Is that freedom limited to party members? To members of the royal family? 
To the top ten corporations on the New York Stock Exchange? Or is that freedom 
spread broadly? To artists generally, whether affiliated with the Met or not? To 
musicians generally, whether white or not? To filmmakers generally, whether 
affiliated with a studio or not?
Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build 
upon; unfree, or permission, cultures leave much less. Ours was a free culture. 
It is becoming much less so.
