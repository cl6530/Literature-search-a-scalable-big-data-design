Here was once a man who travelled the land all over in search of a
wife. He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could
not meet with one to his mind. At last he found a woman, young, fair,

once, and thought no man so fortunate as he was. They lived happily
together, but, though he wished people to think otherwise, he was
fonder of the golden arm than of all his wife’s gifts besides.
At last she died. The husband put on the blackest black, and pulled
the longest face at the funeral; but for all that he got up in the
middle of the night, dug up the body, and cut off the golden arm. He
hurried home to hide his treasure, and thought no one would know.
The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and was
just falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the
room. Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, and looked at
him reproachfully. Pretending not to be afraid, he spoke to the ghost,
and said: “What hast thou done with thy cheeks so red?”
“All withered and wasted away,” replied the ghost, in a hollow tone.

“What hast thou done with thy golden hair?”
“All withered and wasted away.”
“What hast thou done with thy Golden Arm?”
“Thou Hast It!”
