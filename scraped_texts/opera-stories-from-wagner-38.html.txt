Mimi took good care of Siegfried.
When the boy had grown large enough to play about in the woods, Mimi
made for him a little silver horn.
Siegfried loved all the birds and the wild animals.
He knew they were his best friends, for something in Mimi’s face always

Siegfried would wander out into the forest with his silver horn swinging
from his shoulder.
He would blow his little horn song, and his forest friends would hear
the call and come to play with him.
He watched the birds as they built their nests.
He listened to the father bird as he warbled his pretty little love
songs.
How sweetly he sang to the mother bird while she sat upon the nest!
And when the little eggs had told their secret, both the father and the
mother birds carried food to the babies.
Siegfried saw how tenderly the mother foxes, wolves, and bears cared for
their babies.
From these friends in the forest he learned what love is.
