GALLOWS, n.  A stage for the performance of miracle plays, in which 
the leading actor is translated to heaven.  In this country the 
gallows is chiefly remarkable for the number of persons who escape it.
  Whether on the gallows high
      Or where blood flows the reddest,
  The noblest place for man to die —
      Is where he died the deadest.
(Old play)

GARGOYLE, n.  A rain-spout projecting from the eaves of mediaeval 
buildings, commonly fashioned into a grotesque caricature of some 
personal enemy of the architect or owner of the building.  This was 
especially the case in churches and ecclesiastical structures 
generally, in which the gargoyles presented a perfect rogues’ gallery 
of local heretics and controversialists.  Sometimes when a new dean 
and chapter were installed the old gargoyles were removed and others 
substituted having a closer relation to the private animosities of the 
new incumbents.
GARTHER, n.  An elastic band intended to keep a woman from coming out 
of her stockings and desolating the country.
GENEROUS, adj.  Originally this word meant noble by birth and was 
rightly applied to a great multitude of persons.  It now means noble 
by nature and is taking a bit of a rest.
GENEALOGY, n.  An account of one’s descent from an ancestor who did 
not particularly care to trace his own.
GENTEEL, adj.  Refined, after the fashion of a gent.
  Observe with care, my son, the distinction I reveal:
  A gentleman is gentle and a gent genteel.
  Heed not the definitions your “Unabridged” presents,
  For dictionary makers are generally gents.
G.J.

GEOGRAPHER, n.  A chap who can tell you offhand the difference between 
the outside of the world and the inside.
  Habeam, geographer of wide reknown,
  Native of Abu-Keber’s ancient town,
  In passing thence along the river Zam
  To the adjacent village of Xelam,
  Bewildered by the multitude of roads,
  Got lost, lived long on migratory toads,
  Then from exposure miserably died,
  And grateful travelers bewailed their guide.
Henry Haukhorn

GEOLOGY, n.  The science of the earth’s crust — to which, doubtless, 
will be added that of its interior whenever a man shall come up 
garrulous out of a well.  The geological formations of the globe 
already noted are catalogued thus:  The Primary, or lower one, 
consists of rocks, bones or mired mules, gas-pipes, miners’ tools, 
antique statues minus the nose, Spanish doubloons and ancestors.  The 
Secondary is largely made up of red worms and moles.  The Tertiary 
comprises railway tracks, patent pavements, grass, snakes, mouldy 
boots, beer bottles, tomato cans, intoxicated citizens, garbage, 
anarchists, snap-dogs and fools.
GHOST, n.  The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.
          He saw a ghost.
  It occupied — that dismal thing! —
  The path that he was following.
  Before he’d time to stop and fly,
  An earthquake trifled with the eye
          That saw a ghost.
  He fell as fall the early good;
  Unmoved that awful vision stood.
  The stars that danced before his ken
  He wildly brushed away, and then
          He saw a post.
Jared Macphester

  Accounting for the uncommon behavior of ghosts, Heine mentions 
somebody’s ingenious theory to the effect that they are as much 
afraid of us as we of them.  Not quite, if I may judge from such 
tables of comparative speed as I am able to compile from memories of 
my own experience.
  There is one insuperable obstacle to a belief in ghosts.  A ghost 
never comes naked:  he appears either in a winding-sheet or “in his 
habit as he lived.”  To believe in him, then, is to believe that not 
only have the dead the power to make themselves visible after there is 
nothing left of them, but that the same power inheres in textile 
fabrics.  Supposing the products of the loom to have this ability, 
what object would they have in exercising it?  And why does not the 
apparition of a suit of clothes sometimes walk abroad without a ghost 
in it?  These be riddles of significance.  They reach away down and 
get a convulsive grip on the very tap-root of this flourishing faith.
GHOUL, n.  A demon addicted to the reprehensible habit of devouring 
the dead.  The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of 
controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of 
comforting beliefs than to give it anything good in their place.  In 
1640 Father Secchi saw one in a cemetery near Florence and frightened 
it away with the sign of the cross.  He describes it as gifted with 
many heads an an uncommon allowance of limbs, and he saw it in more 
than one place at a time.  The good man was coming away from dinner at 
the time and explains that if he had not been “heavy with eating” he 
would have seized the demon at all hazards.  Atholston relates that a 
ghoul was caught by some sturdy peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury 
and ducked in a horsepond.  (He appears to think that so distinguished 
a criminal should have been ducked in a tank of rosewater.)  The water 
turned at once to blood “and so contynues unto ys daye.”  The pond has 
since been bled with a ditch.  As late as the beginning of the 
fourteenth century a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of the cathedral 
at Amiens and the whole population surrounded the place.  Twenty armed 
men with a priest at their head, bearing a crucifix, entered and 
captured the ghoul, which, thinking to escape by the stratagem, had 
transformed itself to the semblance of a well known citizen, but was 
nevertheless hanged, drawn and quartered in the midst of hideous 
popular orgies.  The citizen whose shape the demon had assumed was so 
affected by the sinister occurrence that he never again showed himself 
in Amiens and his fate remains a mystery.
GLUTTON, n.  A person who escapes the evils of moderation by 
committing dyspepsia.
GNOME, n.  In North-European mythology, a dwarfish imp inhabiting the 
interior parts of the earth and having special custody of mineral 
treasures.  Bjorsen, who died in 1765, says gnomes were common enough 
in the southern parts of Sweden in his boyhood, and he frequently saw 
them scampering on the hills in the evening twilight.  Ludwig 
Binkerhoof saw three as recently as 1792, in the Black Forest, and 
Sneddeker avers that in 1803 they drove a party of miners out of a 
Silesian mine.  Basing our computations upon data supplied by these 
statements, we find that the gnomes were probably extinct as early as 
1764.
GNOSTICS, n.  A sect of philosophers who tried to engineer a fusion 
between the early Christians and the Platonists.  The former would not 
go into the caucus and the combination failed, greatly to the chagrin 
of the fusion managers.
GNU, n.  An animal of South Africa, which in its domesticated state 
resembles a horse, a buffalo and a stag.  In its wild condition it is 
something like a thunderbolt, an earthquake and a cyclone.
  A hunter from Kew caught a distant view
      Of a peacefully meditative gnu,
  And he said:  “I’ll pursue, and my hands imbrue
      In its blood at a closer interview."
  But that beast did ensue and the hunter it threw
      O’er the top of a palm that adjacent grew;
  And he said as he flew:  “It is well I withdrew
      Ere, losing my temper, I wickedly slew
      That really meritorious gnu.”

GOOD, adj.  Sensible, madam, to the worth of this present writer.  
Alive, sir, to the advantages of letting him alone.
GOOSE, n.  A bird that supplies quills for writing.  These, by some 
occult process of nature, are penetrated and suffused with various 
degrees of the bird’s intellectual energies and emotional character, 
so that when inked and drawn mechanically across paper by a person 
called an “author,” there results a very fair and accurate transcript 
of the fowl’s thought and feeling.  The difference in geese, as 
discovered by this ingenious method, is considerable:  many are found 
to have only trivial and insignificant powers, but some are seen to be 
very great geese indeed.
GORGON, n.
  The Gorgon was a maiden bold
  Who turned to stone the Greeks of old
  That looked upon her awful brow.
  We dig them out of ruins now,
  And swear that workmanship so bad
  Proves all the ancient sculptors mad.
GOUT, n.  A physician’s name for the rheumatism of a rich patient.
GRACES, n.  Three beautiful goddesses, Aglaia, Thalia and Euphrosyne, 
who attended upon Venus, serving without salary.  They were at no 
expense for board and clothing, for they ate nothing to speak of and 
dressed according to the weather, wearing whatever breeze happened to 
be blowing.
GRAMMAR, n.  A system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for the feet 
for the self-made man, along the path by which he advances to 
distinction.
GRAPE, n.
  Hail noble fruit! — by Homer sung,
      Anacreon and Khayyam;
  Thy praise is ever on the tongue
      Of better men than I am.
  The lyre in my hand has never swept,
      The song I cannot offer:
  My humbler service pray accept —
      I’ll help to kill the scoffer.
  The water-drinkers and the cranks
      Who load their skins with liquor —
  I’ll gladly bear their belly-tanks
      And tap them with my sticker.
  Fill up, fill up, for wisdom cools
      When e’er we let the wine rest.
  Here’s death to Prohibition’s fools,
      And every kind of vine-pest!
Jamrach Holobom

GRAPESHOT, n.  An argument which the future is preparing in answer to 
the demands of American Socialism.
GRAVE, n.  A place in which the dead are laid to await the coming of 
the medical student.
  Beside a lonely grave I stood —
      With brambles ’twas encumbered;
  The winds were moaning in the wood,
      Unheard by him who slumbered,
  A rustic standing near, I said:
      “He cannot hear it blowing!"
  “’Course not,” said he:  “the feller’s dead —
      He can’t hear nowt [sic] that’s going.”
  “Too true,” I said; “alas, too true —
      No sound his sense can quicken!"
  “Well, mister, wot is that to you? —
      The deadster ain’t a-kickin’.”
  I knelt and prayed:  “O Father, smile
      On him, and mercy show him!"
  That countryman looked on the while,
      And said:  “Ye didn’t know him.”
Pobeter Dunko

GRAVITATION, n.  The tendency of all bodies to approach one another 
with a strength proportion to the quantity of matter they contain — 
the quantity of matter they contain being ascertained by the strength 
of their tendency to approach one another.  This is a lovely and 
edifying illustration of how science, having made A the proof of B, 
makes B the proof of A.
GREAT, adj.
  “I’m great,” the Lion said — “I reign
  The monarch of the wood and plain!”
  The Elephant replied:  “I’m great —
  No quadruped can match my weight!”
  “I’m great — no animal has half
  So long a neck!” said the Giraffe.
  “I’m great,” the Kangaroo said — “see
  My femoral muscularity!”
  The ’Possum said:  “I’m great — behold,
  My tail is lithe and bald and cold!”
  An Oyster fried was understood
  To say:  “I’m great because I’m good!”
  Each reckons greatness to consist
  In that in which he heads the list,
  And Vierick thinks he tops his class
  Because he is the greatest ass.
Arion Spurl Doke

GUILLOTINE, n.  A machine which makes a Frenchman shrug his shoulders 
with good reason.
  In his great work on Divergent Lines of Racial Evolution, the 
learned Professor Brayfugle argues from the prevalence of this gesture 
— the shrug — among Frenchmen, that they are descended from turtles 
and it is simply a survival of the habit of retracing the head inside 
the shell.  It is with reluctance that I differ with so eminent an 
authority, but in my judgment (as more elaborately set forth and 
enforced in my work entitled Hereditary Emotions — lib. II, c. XI) 
the shrug is a poor foundation upon which to build so important a 
theory, for previously to the Revolution the gesture was unknown.  I 
have not a doubt that it is directly referable to the terror inspired 
by the guillotine during the period of that instrument’s activity.
GUNPOWDER, n.  An agency employed by civilized nations for the 
settlement of disputes which might become troublesome if left 
unadjusted.  By most writers the invention of gunpowder is ascribed to 
the Chinese, but not upon very convincing evidence.  Milton says it 
was invented by the devil to dispel angels with, and this opinion 
seems to derive some support from the scarcity of angels.  Moreover, 
it has the hearty concurrence of the Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of 
Agriculture.
  Secretary Wilson became interested in gunpowder through an event 
that occurred on the Government experimental farm in the District of 
Columbia.  One day, several years ago, a rogue imperfectly reverent of 
the Secretary’s profound attainments and personal character presented 
him with a sack of gunpowder, representing it as the sed of the 
Flashawful flabbergastor, a Patagonian cereal of great commercial 
value, admirably adapted to this climate.  The good Secretary was 
instructed to spill it along in a furrow and afterward inhume it with 
soil.  This he at once proceeded to do, and had made a continuous line 
of it all the way across a ten-acre field, when he was made to look 
backward by a shout from the generous donor, who at once dropped a 
lighted match into the furrow at the starting-point.  Contact with the 
earth had somewhat dampened the powder, but the startled functionary 
saw himself pursued by a tall moving pillar of fire and smoke and 
fierce evolution.  He stood for a moment paralyzed and speechless, 
then he recollected an engagement and, dropping all, absented himself 
thence with such surprising celerity that to the eyes of spectators 
along the route selected he appeared like a long, dim streak 
prolonging itself with inconceivable rapidity through seven villages, 
and audibly refusing to be comforted.  “Great Scott! what is that?” 
cried a surveyor’s chainman, shading his eyes and gazing at the fading 
line of agriculturist which bisected his visible horizon.  “That,” 
said the surveyor, carelessly glancing at the phenomenon and again 
centering his attention upon his instrument, “is the Meridian of 
Washington.”
