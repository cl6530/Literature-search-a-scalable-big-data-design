To-day I visited her: she rose to receive me, and I kissed her
hand most tenderly.
A canary at the moment flew from a mirror, and settled upon her

wings, and pecks so nicely. He kisses me, too, only look!”
She held the bird to her mouth; and he pressed her sweet lips with
so much fervour that he seemed to feel the excess of bliss which
he enjoyed.
“He shall kiss you too,” she added; and then she held the bird

delightful sensation seemed like the forerunner of the sweetest
bliss.
“A kiss,” I observed, “does not seem to satisfy him: he wishes for
food, and seems disappointed by these unsatisfactory endearments.”
“But he eats out of my mouth,” she continued, and extended her
lips to him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm of
a being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love.
I turned my face away. She should not act thus. She ought not to
