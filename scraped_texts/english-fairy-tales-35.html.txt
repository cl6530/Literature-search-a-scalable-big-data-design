A woman was sitting at her reel one night; And still she sat, and
still she reeled, and still she wished for company.
In came a pair of broad broad soles, and sat down at the fireside;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of small small legs, and sat down on the broad broad
soles;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of thick thick knees, and sat down on the small small
legs;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of thin thin thighs, and sat down on the thick thick
knees;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of huge huge hips, and sat down on the thin thin
thighs;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a wee wee waist, and sat down on the huge huge hips;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of broad broad shoulders, and sat down on the wee wee
waist;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of small small arms, and sat down on the broad broad
shoulders;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a pair of huge huge hands, and sat down on the small small
arms;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a small small neck, and sat down on the broad broad shoulders;
And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for
company.
In came a huge huge head, and sat down on the small small neck.
