What a misfortune, Wilhelm! My active spirits have degenerated
into contented indolence. I cannot be idle, and yet I am unable
to set to work. I cannot think: I have no longer any feeling for
the beauties of nature, and books are distasteful to me. Once we
give ourselves up, we are totally lost. Many a time and oft I
wish I were a common labourer; that, awakening in the morning, I
might have but one prospect, one pursuit, one hope, for the day
which has dawned. I often envy Albert when I see him buried in a
heap of papers and parchments, and I fancy I should be happy were
I in his place. Often impressed with this feeling I have been on
the point of writing to you and to the minister, for the appointment
at the embassy, which you think I might obtain. I believe I might
procure it. The minister has long shown a regard for me, and has
frequently urged me to seek employment. It is the business of an
hour only. Now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me. 
Weary of liberty, he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled,
and was ridden to death for his pains. I know not what to determine
