Francis Bacon (1561-1626)




DEFORMED persons are commonly even with
nature; for as nature hath done ill by them,
so do they by nature; being for the most part (as
the Scripture saith) void of natural affection; and
so they have their revenge of nature.  Certainly
there is a consent, between the body and the mind;
and where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth
in the other.  Ubi peccat in uno, periclitatur in altero.  But because there is, in man, an election
touching the frame of his mind, and a necessity in
the frame of his body, the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured, by the sun of discipline and virtue.  Therefore it is good to consider of
deformity, not as a sign, which is more deceivable;
but as a cause, which seldom faileth of the effect.
Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person, that
doth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur
in himself, to rescue and deliver himself from
scorn.  Therefore all deformed persons, are extreme
bold.  First, as in their own defence, as being exposed to scorn; but in process of time, by a general
habit.  Also it stirreth in them industry, and especially of this kind, to watch and observe the weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to
repay.  Again, in their superiors, it quencheth
jealousy towards them, as persons that they think
they may, at pleasure, despise: and it layeth their
competitors and emulators asleep; as never believing they should be in possibility of advancement,
till they see them in possession.  So that upon the
matter, in a great wit, deformity is an advantage
to rising.  Kings in ancient times (and at this present in some countries) were wont to put great trust
in eunuchs; because they that are envious towards
all are more obnoxious and officious, towards one.
But yet their trust towards them, hath rather
been as to good spials, and good wbisperers, than
good magistrates and officers.  And much like is
the reason of deformed persons.  Still the ground
is, they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free themselves from scorn; which must be either by virtue
or malice; and therefore let it not be marvelled, if
sometimes they prove excellent persons; as was
Agesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, AEsop,
Gasca, President of Peru; and Socrates may go
likewise amongst them; with others.
