Wednesday, Nov. 5th.  The weather was fine during the previous night,
and we had a clear view of the Magellan Clouds, and of the Southern Cross.
The Magellan Clouds consist of three small nebulae in the southern
part of the heavens,–two bright, like the milky-way, and one dark.
These are first seen, just above the horizon, soon after crossing
the southern tropic.  When off Cape Horn, they are nearly overhead.
The cross is composed of four stars in that form, and is said to be
the brightest constellation in the heavens.
During the first part of this day (Wednesday) the wind was light,
but after noon it came on fresh, and we furled the royals.  We still
kept the studding-sails out, and the captain said he should go round
with them, if he could.  Just before eight o’clock, (then about sun-down,
in that latitude,) the cry of “All hands ahoy!” was sounded down
the fore scuttle and the after hatchway, and hurrying upon deck,
we found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the south-west,
and blackening the whole heavens.  “Here comes the Cape Horn!” said
the chief mate; and we had hardly time to haul down and clew up,
before it was upon us.  In a few moments, a heavier sea was raised
than I had ever seen before, and as it was directly ahead, the little
brig, which was no better than a bathing machine, plunged into it,
and all the forward part of her was under water; the sea pouring in
through the bow-ports and hawse-hole and over the knight-heads,
threatening to wash everything overboard.  In the lee scuppers it
was up to a man’s waist.  We sprang aloft and double reefed the
topsails, and furled all the other sails, and made all snug.
But this would not do; the brig was laboring and straining against
the head sea, and the gale was growing worse and worse.  At the same
time the sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us.
We clewed down, and hauled out the reef-tackles again, and close-reefed
the fore-topsail, and furled the main, and hove her to on the starboard
tack.  Here was an end to our fine prospects.  We made up our minds to
head winds and cold weather; sent down the royal yards, and unrove
the gear, but all the rest of the top hamper remained aloft, even to
the sky-sail masts and studding-sail booms.
Throughout the night it stormed violently–rain, hail, snow, and
sleet beating down upon the vessel–the wind continuing to break ahead,
and the sea running high.  At daybreak (about three, A.M.) the deck
was covered with snow.  The captain sent up the steward with a glass
of grog to each of the watch; and all the time that we were off the Cape,
grog was given to the morning watch, and to all hands whenever we reefed
topsails.  The clouds cleared away at sun-rise, and the wind becoming
more fair, we again made sail and stood nearly up to our course.
Thursday, Nov. 6th.  It continued more pleasant through the first
part of the day, but at night we had the same scene over again.
This time, we did not heave to, as on the night before, but endeavored
to beat to windward under close-reefed top-sails, balance-reefed trysail,
and fore top-mast stay-sail.  This night it was my turn to steer, or,
as the sailors say, my trick at the helm, for two hours.  Inexperienced
as I was, I made out to steer to the satisfaction of the officer,
and neither S––- nor myself gave up our tricks, all the time that
we were off the Cape.  This was something to boast of, for it requires
a good deal of skill and watchfulness to steer a vessel close hauled,
in a gale of wind, against a heavy head sea.  “Ease her when she pitches,"
is the word; and a little carelessness in letting her ship a heavy sea,
might sweep the decks, or knock masts out of her.
Friday, Nov. 7th.  Towards morning the wind went down, and during
the whole forenoon we lay tossing about in a dead calm, and in the
midst of a thick fog.  The calms here are unlike those in most parts
of the world, for there is always such a high sea running, and the
periods of calm are so short, that it has no time to go down;
and vessels, being under no command of sails or rudder, lie like
logs upon the water.  We were obliged to steady the booms and yards
by guys and braces, and to lash everything well below.  We now found
our top hamper of some use, for though it is liable to be carried
away or sprung by the sudden “bringing up” of a vessel when pitching
in a chopping sea, yet it is a great help in steadying a vessel when
rolling in a long swell; giving it more slowness, ease, and regularity
to the motion.
The calm of the morning reminds me of a scene which I forgot to
describe at the time of its occurrence, but which I remember from
its being the first time that I had heard the near breathing of whales.
It was on the night that we passed between the Falkland Islands and
Staten Land.  We had the watch from twelve to four, and coming upon deck,
found the little brig lying perfectly still, surrounded by a thick fog,
and the sea as smooth as though oil had been poured upon it; yet now
and then a long, low swell rolling over its surface, slightly lifting
the vessel, but without breaking the glassy smoothness of the water.
We were surrounded far and near by shoals of sluggish whales and
grampuses; which the fog prevented our seeing, rising slowly to the
surface, or perhaps lying out at length, heaving out those peculiar
lazy, deep, and long-drawn breathings which give such an impression
of supineness and strength.  Some of the watch were asleep, and the
others were perfectly still, so that there was nothing to break the
illusion, and I stood leaning over the bulwarks, listening to the
slow breathing of the mighty creatures–now one breaking the water
just alongside, whose black body I almost fancied that I could see
through the fog; and again another, which I could just hear in the
distance–until the low and regular swell seemed like the heaving
of the ocean’s mighty bosom to the sound of its heavy and long-drawn
respirations.
Towards the evening of this day, (Friday 7th,) the fog cleared off,
and we had every appearance of a cold blow; and soon after sun-down
it came on.  Again it was clew up and haul down, reef and furl,
until we had got her down to close-reefed topsails, double-reefed
trysail, and reefed forespenser.  Snow, hail, and sleet were driving
upon us most of the night, and the sea was breaking over the bows
and covering the forward part of the little vessel; but as she would
lay her course the captain refused to heave her to.
Saturday, Nov. 8th.  This day commenced with calm and thick fog,
and ended with hail, snow, a violent wind, and close-reefed topsails.
Sunday, Nov. 9th.  To-day the sun rose clear and continued so until
twelve o’clock, when the captain got an observation.  This was very
well for Cape Horn, and we thought it a little remarkable that,
as we had not had one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage,
the only tolerable day here should be a Sunday.  We got time to
clear up the steerage and forecastle, and set things to rights,
and to overhaul our wet clothes a little.  But this did not last
very long.  Between five and six–the sun was then nearly three
hours high–the cry of “All starbowlines ahoy!” summoned our watch
on deck; and immediately all hands were called.  A true specimen
of Cape Horn was coming upon us.  A great cloud of a dark slate-color
was driving on us from the south-west; and we did our best to take
in sail, (for the light sails had been set during the first part of
the day,) before we were in the midst of it.  We had got the light
sails furled, the courses hauled up, and the topsail reef-tackles
hauled out, and were just mounting the fore-rigging, when the storm
struck us.  In an instant the sea, which had been comparatively quiet,
was running higher and higher; and it became almost as dark as night.
The hail and sleet were harder than I had yet felt them; seeming to
almost pin us down to the rigging.  We were longer taking in sail
than ever before; for the sails were stiff and wet, the ropes and
rigging covered with snow and sleet, and we ourselves cold and nearly
blinded with the violence of the storm.  By the time we had got down
upon deck again, the little brig was plunging madly into a tremendous
head sea, which at every drive rushed in through the bow-ports and
over the bows, and buried all the forward part of the vessel.  At this
instant the chief mate, who was standing on the top of the windlass,
at the foot of the spenser mast, called out, “Lay out there and furl
the jib!”  This was no agreeable or safe duty, yet it must be done.
An old Swede, (the best sailor on board,) who belonged on the forecastle,
sprang out upon the bowsprit.  Another one must go: I was near the mate,
and sprang forward, threw the down-haul over the windlass, and jumped
between the knight-heads out upon the bowsprit.  The crew stood abaft
the windlass and hauled the jib down, while we got out upon the weather
side of the jib-boom, our feet on the foot ropes, holding on by the spar,
the great jib flying off to leeward and slatting so as almost to throw
us off of the boom.  For some time we could do nothing but hold on,
and the vessel diving into two huge seas, one after the other, plunged us
twice into the water up to our chins.  We hardly knew whether we were
on or off; when coming up, dripping from the water, we were raised high
into the air.  John (that was the sailor’s name) thought the boom
would go, every moment, and called out to the mate to keep the vessel
off, and haul down the staysail; but the fury of the wind and the
breaking of the seas against the bows defied every attempt to make
ourselves heard, and we were obliged to do the best we could in our
situation.  Fortunately, no other seas so heavy struck her, and we
succeeded in furling the jib “after a fashion"; and, coming in over
the staysail nettings, were not a little pleased to find that all
was snug, and the watch gone below; for we were soaked through,
and it was very cold.  The weather continued nearly the same
through the night.
Monday, Nov. 10th.  During a part of this day we were hove to,
but the rest of the time were driving on, under close-reefed sails,
with a heavy sea, a strong gale, and frequent squalls of hail and snow.
Tuesday, Nov. 11th.  The same.
Wednesday, Nov. 12th.  The same.
Thursday, Nov. 13th.  The same.
We had now got hardened to Cape weather, the vessel was under
reduced sail, and everything secured on deck and below, so that
we had little to do but steer and to stand our watch.  Our clothes
were all wet through, and the only change was from wet to more wet.
It was in vain to think of reading or working below, for we were
too tired, the hatchways were closed down, and everything was wet
and uncomfortable, black and dirty, heaving and pitching.  We had
only to come below when the watch was out, wring out our wet clothes,
hang them up, and turn in and sleep as soundly as we could, until the
watch was called again.  A sailor can sleep anywhere–no sound of
wind, water, wood or iron can keep him awake–and we were always
fast asleep when three blows on the hatchway, and the unwelcome
cry of “All starbowlines ahoy! eight bells there below! do you
hear the news?” (the usual formula of calling the watch), roused us
up from our berths upon the cold, wet decks.  The only time when we
could be said to take any pleasure was at night and morning, when we
were allowed a tin pot full of hot tea, (or, as the sailors significantly
call it, “water bewitched,”) sweetened with molasses.  This, bad as
it was, was still warm and comforting, and, together with our sea
biscuit and cold salt beef, made quite a meal.  Yet even this meal
was attended with some uncertainty.  We had to go ourselves to the
galley and take our kid of beef and tin pots of tea, and run the
risk of losing them before we could get below.  Many a kid of beef
have I seen rolling in the scuppers, and the bearer lying at his
length on the decks.  I remember an English lad who was always the
life of the crew, but whom we afterwards lost overboard, standing for
nearly ten minutes at the galley, with this pot of tea in his hand,
waiting for a chance to get down into the forecastle; and seeing
what he thought was a “smooth spell,” started to go forward.  He had
just got to the end of the windlass, when a great sea broke over the
bows, and for a moment I saw nothing of him but his head and shoulders;
and at the next instant, being taken off of his legs, he was carried
aft with the sea, until her stern lifting up and sending the water
forward, he was left high and dry at the side of the long-boat,
still holding on to his tin pot, which had now nothing in it but
salt water.  But nothing could ever daunt him, or overcome, for a
moment, his habitual good humor.  Regaining his legs, and shaking
his fist at the man at the wheel, he rolled below, saying, as he
passed, “A man’s no sailor, if he can’t take a joke.”  The ducking
was not the worst of such an affair, for, as there was an allowance
of tea, you could get no more from the galley; and though sailors
would never suffer a man to go without, but would always turn in
a little from their own pots to fill up his, yet this was at best
but dividing the loss among all hands.
Something of the same kind befell me a few days after.  The cook
had just made for us a mess of hot “scouse"–that is, biscuit pounded
fine, salt beef cut into small pieces, and a few potatoes, boiled up
together and seasoned with pepper.  This was a rare treat, and I,
being the last at the galley, had it put in my charge to carry down
for the mess.  I got along very well as far as the hatchway, and was
just getting down the steps, when a heavy sea, lifting the stern out
of water, and passing forward, dropping it down again, threw the steps
from their place, and I came down into the steerage a little faster
than I meant to, with the kid on top of me, and the whole precious
mess scattered over the floor.  Whatever your feelings may be,
you must make a joke of everything at sea; and if you were to fall
from aloft and be caught in the belly of a sail, and thus saved
from instant death, it would not do to look at all disturbed,
or to make a serious matter of it.
Friday, Nov. 14th.  We were now well to the westward of the Cape
and were changing our course to the northward as much as we dared,
since the strong south-west winds, which prevailed then, carried us
in toward Patagonia.  At two, P.M., we saw a sail on our larboard beam,
and at four we made it out to be a large ship, steering our course,
under single-reefed topsails.  We at that time had shaken the reefs
out of our topsails, as the wind was lighter, and set the main
top-gallant sail.  As soon as our captain saw what sail she was under,
he set the fore top-gallant sail and flying jib; and the old whaler–
for such, his boats and short sail showed him to be–felt a little
ashamed, and shook the reefs out of his topsails, but could do no more,
for he had sent down his top-gallant masts off the Cape.  He ran down
for us, and answered our hail as the whale-ship, New England,
of Poughkeepsie, one hundred and twenty days from New York.
Our captain gave our name, and added, ninety-two days from Boston.
They then had a little conversation about longitude, in which they
found that they could not agree.  The ship fell astern, and continued
in sight during the night.  Toward morning, the wind having become
light, we crossed our royal and skysail yards, and at daylight we
were seen under a cloud of sail, having royal and skysails fore
and aft.  The “spouter,” as the sailors call a whaleman, had sent
up his main top-gallant mast and set the sail, and made signal for
us to heave to.  About half-past seven their whale-boat came alongside,
and Captain Job Terry sprang on board, a man known in every port and
by every vessel in the Pacific ocean.  “Don’t you know Job Terry?
I thought everybody knew Job Terry,” said a green-hand, who came in
the boat, to me, when I asked him about his captain.  He was indeed
a singular man.  He was six feet high, wore thick, cowhide boots,
and brown coat and trowsers, and, except a sun-burnt complexion,
had not the slightest appearance of a sailor; yet he had been forty
years in the whale trade, and, as he said himself, had owned ships,
built ships, and sailed ships.  His boat’s crew were a pretty raw set,
just out of the bush, and as the sailor’s phrase is, “hadn’t got the
hayseed out of their hair.”  Captain Terry convinced our captain that
our reckoning was a little out, and, having spent the day on board,
put off in his boat at sunset for his ship, which was now six or
eight miles astern.  He began a “yarn” when he came on board,
which lasted, with but little intermission, for four hours.
It was all about himself, and the Peruvian government, and the
Dublin frigate, and Lord James Townshend, and President Jackson,
and the ship Ann M’Kim of Baltimore.  It would probably never have
come to an end, had not a good breeze sprung up, which sent him off
to his own vessel.  One of the lads who came in his boat, a thoroughly
countrified-looking fellow, seemed to care very little about the vessel,
rigging, or anything else, but went round looking at the live stock,
and leaned over the pig-sty, and said he wished he was back again
tending his father’s pigs.
At eight o’clock we altered our course to the northward, bound for
Juan Fernandez.
This day we saw the last of the albatrosses, which had been our
companions a great part of the time off the Cape.  I had been
interested in the bird from descriptions which I had read of it,
and was not at all disappointed.  We caught one or two with a
baited hook which we floated astern upon a shingle.  Their long,
flapping wings, long legs, and large, staring eyes, give them a
very peculiar appearance.  They look well on the wing; but one
of the finest sights that I have ever seen, was an albatross
asleep upon the water, during a calm, off Cape Horn, when a heavy
sea was running.  There being no breeze, the surface of the water
was unbroken, but a long, heavy swell was rolling, and we saw the
fellow, all white, directly ahead of us, asleep upon the waves,
with his head under his wing; now rising on the top of a huge billow,
and then falling slowly until he was lost in the hollow between.
He was undisturbed for some time, until the noise of our bows,
gradually approaching, roused him, when, lifting his head, he stared
upon us for a moment, and then spread his wide wings and took his flight.
