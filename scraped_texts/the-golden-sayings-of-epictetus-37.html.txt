“Why, who told you that your powers were equal to God’s?”
Yet God hath placed by the side of each a man’s own Guardian
Spirit,(4) who is charged to watch over him—a Guardian who
sleeps not nor is deceived. For to what better or more watchful
Guardian could He have committed each of us? So when you have
shut the doors and made a darkness within, remember never to say
that you are alone; for you are not alone, but God is within,
and your Guardian Spirit, and what light do they need to behold
what you do? To this God you also should have sworn allegiance,
even as soldiers unto Caesar. They, when their service is hired,
swear to hold the life of Caesar dearer than all else: and will
you not swear your oath, that are deemed worthy of so many and
great gifts? And will you not keep your oath when you have sworn
it? And what oath will you swear? Never to disobey, never to
arraign or murmur at aught that comes to you from His hand: never
unwillingly to do or suffer aught that necessity lays upon you.
