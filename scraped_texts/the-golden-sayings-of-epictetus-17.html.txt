I do not think that an old fellow like me need have been
sitting here to try and prevent your entertaining abject notions
of yourselves, and talking of yourselves in an abject and ignoble
way: but to prevent there being by chance among you any such
young men as, after recognising their kindred to the Gods, and
their bondage in these chains of the body and its manifold
necessities, should desire to cast them off as burdens too
grievous to be borne, and depart to their true kindred. This is
the struggle in which your Master and Teacher, were he worthy of
the name, should be engaged. You would come to me and say:
“Epictetus, we can no longer endure being chained to this
wretched body, giving it food and drink and rest and
purification;  aye, and for its sake forced to be subservient to
this man and that. Are not these things indifferent and nothing
to us? Is it not true that death is no evil? Are we not in a
manner kinsmen of the Gods, and have we not come from them? Let
us depart thither, whence we came: let us be freed from these
chains that confine and press us down. Here are thieves and
robbers and tribunals: and they that are called tyrants, who
deem that they have after a fashion power over us, because of
the miserable body and what appertains to it. Let us show them
that they have power over none.”
