We kept up a constant connection with the Presidio, and by the close
of the summer I had added much to my vocabulary, beside having made
the acquaintance of nearly everybody in the place, and acquired some
knowledge of the character and habits of the people, as well as of
the institutions under which they live.
California was first discovered in 1536, by Cortes, and was subsequently
visited by numerous other adventurers as well as commissioned voyagers
of the Spanish crown.  It was found to be inhabited by numerous tribes
of Indians, and to be in many parts extremely fertile; to which, of course,
was added rumors of gold mines, pearl fishery, etc.  No sooner was the
importance of the country known, than the Jesuits obtained leave to
establish themselves in it, to Christianize and enlighten the Indians.
They established missions in various parts of the country toward the
close of the seventeenth century, and collected the natives about them,
baptizing them into the church, and teaching them the arts of civilized
life.  To protect the Jesuits in their missions, and at the same time
to support the power of the crown over the civilized Indians, two
forts were erected and garrisoned, one at San Diego, and the other
at Monterey.  These were called Presidios, and divided the command of
the whole country between them.  Presidios have since been established
at Santa Barbara and San Francisco; thus dividing the country into
four large districts, each with its presidio, and governed by the
commandant.  The soldiers, for the most part, married civilized
Indians; and thus, in the vicinity of each presidio, sprung up,
gradually, small towns.  In the course of time, vessels began to
come into the ports to trade with the missions, and received hides
in return; and thus began the great trade of California.  Nearly all
the cattle in the country belonged to the missions, and they employed
their Indians, who became, in fact, their slaves, in tending their
vast herds.  In the year 1793, when Vancouver visited San Diego,
the mission had obtained great wealth and power, and are accused of
having depreciated the country with the sovereign, that they might
be allowed to retain their possessions.  On the expulsion of the
Jesuits from the Spanish dominions, the missions passed into the
hands of the Franciscans, though without any essential change in
their management.  Ever since the independence of Mexico, the missions
have been going down; until, at last, a law was passed, stripping them
of all their possessions, and confining the priests to their spiritual
duties; and at the same time declaring all the Indians free and independent
Rancheros.  The change in the condition of the Indians was, as may be
supposed, only nominal: they are virtually slaves, as much as they
ever were.  But in the missions, the change was complete.  The priests
have now no power, except in their religious character, and the great
possessions of the missions are given over to be preyed upon by the
harpies of the civil power, who are sent there in the capacity of
administradores, to settle up the concerns; and who usually end,
in a few years, by making themselves fortunes, and leaving their
stewardships worse than they found them.  The dynasty of the priests
was much more acceptable to the people of the country, and indeed,
to every one concerned with the country, by trade or otherwise,
than that of the administradores.  The priests were attached
perpetually to one mission, and felt the necessity of keeping up
its credit.  Accordingly, their debts were regularly paid, and the
people were, in the main, well treated, and attached to those who
had spent their whole lives among them. But the administradores are
strangers sent from Mexico, having no interest in the country;
not identified in any way with their charge, and, for the most
part, men of desperate fortunes–broken down politicians and
soldiers–whose only object is to retrieve their condition in
as short a time as possible.  The change had been made but a few
years before our arrival upon the coast, yet, in that short time,
the trade was much diminished, credit impaired, and the venerable
missions going rapidly to decay.  The external arrangements remain
the same.  There are four presidios, having under their protection
the various missions, and pueblos, which are towns formed by the
civil power, and containing no mission or presidio.  The most
northerly presidio is San Francisco; the next Monterey; the next
Santa Barbara; including the mission of the same, St. Louis Obispo,
and St. Buenaventura, which is the finest mission in the whole
country, having very fertile soil and rich vineyards.  The last,
and most southerly, is San Diego, including the mission of the same,
San Juan Campestrano, the Pueblo de los Angelos, the largest town in
California, with the neighboring mission of San Gabriel.  The priests
in spiritual matters are subject to the Archbishop of Mexico, and in
temporal matters to the governor-general, who is the great civil and
military head of the country.
The government of the country is an arbitrary democracy; having no
common law, and no judiciary.  Their only laws are made and unmade at
the caprice of the legislature, and are as variable as the legislature
itself.  They pass through the form of sending representatives to the
congress at Mexico, but as it takes several months to go and return,
and there is very little communication between the capital and this
distant province, a member usually stays there, as permanent member,
knowing very well that there will be revolutions at home before he
can write and receive an answer; if another member should be sent,
he has only to challenge him, and decide the contested election in
that way.
Revolutions are matters of constant occurrence in California.
They are got up by men who are at the foot of the ladder and in
desperate circumstances, just as a new political party is started
by such men in our own country.  The only object, of course, is the
loaves and fishes; and instead of caucusing, paragraphing, libelling,
feasting, promising, and lying, as with us, they take muskets and
bayonets, and seizing upon the presidio and custom-house, divide the
spoils, and declare a new dynasty.  As for justice, they know no law
but will and fear.  A Yankee, who had been naturalized, and become a
Catholic, and had married in the country, was sitting in his house at
the Pueblo de los Angelos, with his wife and children, when a Spaniard,
with whom he had had a difficulty, entered the house, and stabbed
him to the heart before them all.  The murderer was seized by some
Yankees who had settled there, and kept in confinement until a
statement of the whole affair could be sent to the governor-general.
He refused to do anything about it, and the countrymen of the
murdered man, seeing no prospect of justice being administered,
made known that if nothing was done, they should try the man
themselves.  It chanced that, at this time, there was a company
of forty trappers and hunters from Kentucky, with their rifles,
who had made their head-quarters at the Pueblo; and these,
together with the Americans and Englishmen in the place, who were
between twenty and thirty in number, took possession of the town,
and waiting a reasonable time, proceeded to try the man according to
the forms in their own country.  A judge and jury were appointed,
and he was tried, convicted, sentenced to be shot, and carried out
before the town, with his eyes blindfolded.  The names of all
the men were then put into a hat and each one pledging himself
to perform his duty, twelve names were drawn out, and the men
took their stations with their rifles, and, firing at the word,
laid him dead.  He was decently buried, and the place was restored
quietly to the proper authorities.  A general, with titles enough
for an hidalgo, was at San Gabriel, and issued a proclamation
as long as the fore-top-bowline, threatening destruction to
the rebels, but never stirred from his fort; for forty Kentucky
hunters, with their rifles, were a match for a whole regiment of
hungry, drawling, lazy half-breeds.  This affair happened while
we were at San Pedro, (the port of the Pueblo,) and we had all
the particulars directly from those who were on the spot.  A few
months afterwards, another man, whom we had often seen in San Diego,
murdered a man and his wife on the high road between the Pueblo and
San Louis Rey, and the foreigners not feeling themselves called upon
to act in this case, the parties being all natives, nothing was done
about it; and I frequently afterwards saw the murderer in San Diego,
where he was living with his wife and family.
When a crime has been committed by Indians, justice, or rather
vengeance, is not so tardy.  One Sunday afternoon, while I was
at San Diego, an Indian was sitting on his horse, when another,
with whom he had had some difficulty, came up to him, drew a long knife,
and plunged it directly into the horse’s heart.  The Indian sprang
from his falling horse, drew out the knife, and plunged it into
the other Indian’s breast, over his shoulder, and laid him dead.
The poor fellow was seized at once, clapped into the calabozo,
and kept there until an answer could be received from Monterey.
A few weeks afterwards, I saw the poor wretch, sitting on the
bare ground, in front of the calabozo, with his feet chained to
a stake, and handcuffs about his wrists.  I knew there was very
little hope for him.  Although the deed was done in hot blood,
the horse on which he was sitting being his own, and a great
favorite, yet he was an Indian, and that was enough.  In about a
week after I saw him, I heard that he had been shot.  These few
instances will serve to give one a notion of the distribution of
justice in California.
In their domestic relations, these people are no better than in their
public.  The men are thriftless, proud, and extravagant, and very
much given to gaming; and the women have but little education,
and a good deal of beauty, and their morality, of course, is none of
the best; yet the instances of infidelity are much less frequent than
one would at first suppose.  In fact, one vice is set over against
another; and thus, something like a balance is obtained.  The women
have but little virtue, but then the jealousy of their husbands is
extreme, and their revenge deadly and almost certain.  A few inches
of cold steel has been the punishment of many an unwary man, who has
been guilty, perhaps, of nothing more than indiscretion of manner.
The difficulties of the attempt are numerous, and the consequences
of discovery fatal.  With the unmarried women, too, great watchfulness
is used.  The main object of the parents is to marry their daughters
well, and to this, the slightest slip would be fatal.  The sharp eyes
of a dueña, and the cold steel of a father or brother, are a protection
which the characters of most of them–men and women–render by no means
useless; for the very men who would lay down their lives to avenge the
dishonor of their own family, would risk the same lives to complete
the dishonor of another.
Of the poor Indians, very little care is taken.  The priests,
indeed, at the missions, are said to keep them very strictly,
and some rules are usually made by the alcaldes to punish their
misconduct; but it all amounts to but little.  Indeed, to show the
entire want of any sense of morality or domestic duty among them,
I have frequently known an Indian to bring his wife, to whom he
was lawfully married in the church, down to the beach, and carry
her back again, dividing with her the money which she had got
from the sailors.  If any of the girls were discovered by the
alcalde to be open evil-livers, they were whipped, and kept at
work sweeping the square of the presidio, and carrying mud and
bricks for the buildings; yet a few reáls would generally buy
them off.  Intemperance, too, is a common vice among the Indians.
The Spaniards, on the contrary, are very abstemious, and I do not
remember ever having seen a Spaniard intoxicated.
Such are the people who inhabit a country embracing four or five
hundred miles of sea-coast, with several good harbors; with fine
forests in the north; the waters filled with fish, and the plains
covered with thousands of herds of cattle; blessed with a climate,
than which there can be no better in the world; free from all
manner of diseases, whether epidemic or endemic; and with a soil
in which corn yields from seventy to eighty fold.  In the hands
of an enterprising people, what a country this might be! we are
ready to say.  Yet how long would a people remain so, in such a
country?  The Americans (as those from the United States are
called) and Englishmen, who are fast filling up the principal
towns, and getting the trade into their hands, are indeed more
industrious and effective than the Spaniards; yet their children
are brought up Spaniards, in every respect, and if the “California
fever” (laziness) spares the first generation, it always attacks
the second.
