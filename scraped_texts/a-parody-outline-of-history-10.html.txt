SCENE I
 A principal street of an American city in the spring of 1918.
At the rear of the stage, representing the opposite sidewalk of
the street, are gathered many people come to bid farewell to the
boys of the Blankth regiment who are soon to march past on their
way to France.
Extending across the “street”, from footlights to “sidewalk”, is
a large white plaster arch, gayly decorated with the Allied
colors.
On this arch is the inscription “For the Freedom of the World.”
At the rising of the curtain, distant march music is heard (off
stage, right); this constantly grows louder during the ensuing
dialogue which takes place between three elderly women crowded
together at the edge of the sidewalk. These women, although,
before the war, of different stations in social rank, are now
united, as are all mothers in the Allied countries, by the
glorious badge which each proudly wears pinned over her
heart—the service star.
The Professor’s Wife—I hear them coming.
The Street-cleaner’s Wife—So do I. I hope my boy Pat sees me.
The Pawnbroker’s Wife—I told my Jean where to look.
The approaching music and the cheering of the spectators drowns
out further conversation.
Enter (right) the regimental band playing the “Stars and Stripes
Forever.”  They march through the arch and exit left. Following
them comes the flag, at the sight of which all the male
spectators (young boys and men too old to fight) remove their
hats. After the colors come the troops, splendid clean faced
fellows, in whose eyes shines the light of civilization’s ideals,
in whose ears rings the never forgettable cry of heroic France
and brave little Belgium.  The boys are marching four abreast,
with a firm determined step; it is as though each man were saying
to himself “They shall not pass.”
After the first few squads have marched through the arch and off
left, the command is issued off-stage “Company—HALT.”  A young
lieutenant repeats this order to his men, and the column comes to
a stop. The men stand at attention until given the command
“Rest”, when they relax and a murmur of conversation arises from
the ranks, in which characteristic sentences “German ideals are
not our ideals” and “Suppose it was your own sister” show only
too well what the boys are thinking of day and night.
As the column halts, the three service star mothers rush out from
the curb and embrace their sons who happen to be in this company.
At the same time a very attractive girl runs up to the young
lieutenant.
The Lieutenant—Ellen!
His Fiancee—John!
The Professor’s Son}
The Streetcleaner’s Son } Mother!
The Pawnbroker’s Son }
The Professor’s Wife } 
The Streetcleaner’s Wife } My Boy!
The Pawnbroker’s Wife }
Voice off stage—Company—Atten SHUN!
 The farewells are said, the men come to attention.
Voice off stage—Forward—MARCH
The Lieutenant—(Pointing with his sword to the inscription on
the arch)—Forward for the Freedom of the World—MARCH.
The men’s teeth click together, their heads are thrown back, and
with a light in their eyes that somehow suggests Joan of Arc the
Crusaders move on.
SCENE 2
 Three months later.
A section of an American front line trench now occupied by the
Blankth regiment.
It is early morning and the three soldiers mentioned in Scene 1
are conversing together for perhaps the last time, for soon they
are to be given the chance which every American man desires more
than anything in the world— the opportunity to go “over the
top”.
The Professor’s Son—Well fellows, in a few minutes we shall be
able to show the people at home that their boys are not cowards
when the fate of civilization is at stake.
The Pawnbroker’s Son—Here’s a newspaper clipping mother sent me.
It’s from a speech made the other day in Congress.  (He reads)
“And we and our children—and our children’s children will never
forget the debt we owe those brave boys who are now in France.”
The Streetcleaner’s Son—That makes a fellow feel pretty good
inside, doesn’t it?  It makes me glad I’m doing my bit— and
after the war I hope the ideals which have inspired us all will
make us better citizens in a better world.
The Professor’s Son—Not only will we be better citizens— not
only will the torch of liberty shine more brightly—but also each
one of us will go back to his job with a deeper vision.
The Pawnbroker’s Son—That’s right I am a musician—a pianist,
you know—and I hope that after the war I shall be able to tell
America, through my music, of the glory of this holy cause.
The Professor’s Son—I didn’t know you were a pianist.
The Pawnbroker’s Son—Yes—ever since I was a boy—I have had no
other interest.  My father tried to make me go into his shop but
I couldn’t stand it.  He got angry and refused to support me; I
had a hard time until I won a scholarship at a New York musical
college. Just before the war I had a chance to play the Schumann
concerto with the Philharmonic; the critics all said that in
another year I would be— but fellows—you must think me
frightfully conceited to talk so, and besides what matters my
musical career in comparison with the sacrifice which everyone is
making?
The Streetcleaner’s Son—And gladly making, too, for it is easy
to give up all, as did Joan of Arc, for France.  Attention, men!
here comes one of our officers.
 The three stand at attention.
Enter the Lieutenant.
The Lieutenant—Well, men, do you feel ready?
The Three—More than ready, sir—eager.
The Lieutenant—Brave men!  (To the Professor’s Son) Come here a
minute, Keating.  I have something to ask you before we go over
the top.
The Professor’s Son and the Lieutenant go to one side.
The Lieutenant—(To the other two in a kindly manner)—At ease!
The Streetcleaner’s Son—Thank you, sir.
They relax from their rigid posture of “attention”.
The Lieutenant—(To the Professor’s Son)—Keating, when we “go
over”, we—may—never come back, you know.  And I want to ask a
favor of you.  I am engaged—to a girl back home—here is her
picture (he draws a photograph from his inner breast pocket and
shows it to the Professor’s Son.)
The Professor’s Son—She is beautiful, Sir.
The Lieutenant—(Putting the photograph back in his pocket)— Yes
very beautiful.  And (dropping his eyes)—I love her.  If—if I
should “go west” I want you to write her and tell her that my
last thoughts were of my country and—her.  We are to be
married— after the war—if (suddenly clearing his throat). Her
name is Ellen Radcliff—here, I’ll write the address down for
you.
He does so, and hands the slip of paper to the Professor’s Son,
who discreetly turns away.
The Lieutenant—(Brusquely)—That’s all, Keating.
A bugle sounds.
The Lieutenant—Attention men!  At the next bugle call you go
over the top— remember that you are Americans and that Americans
know how to fight and die in the cause of liberty and for the
freedom of the world. The Three Soldiers—We are ready to make
the supreme sacrifice if need be.
 The bugle sounds.
The Lieutenant—(Climbing up the ladder to the top of the
trench)— Follow me, men—
The Three Soldiers—(Climbing up after him)—Lafayette—we come,
though poppies bloom in Flanders field.
 They go “over the top”.
SCENE 3
 A section of a Hun trench a minute later.  Two Hun soldiers are
conversing together; another Hun is reading a copy of Nietzsche.
First Hun Soldier—And then we cut the hands off all the little
children— oh it was wonderful.
Second Hun Soldier—I wish I had been there.
 A Hun Lieutenant rushes in.
The Hun Lieutenant—(Kicking the three men and brandishing his
revolver)—Swine—wake up—here come the Americans.
 The three spring to their feet and seize their guns. At the top
of the trench appears the American lieutenant, closely followed
by the three soldiers.
The American Lieutenant—(Coolly)—We come to avenge the sinking
of the Lusitania.
The Hun Lieutenant—Hoch der Kaiser!  Might is stronger than
right!
 He treacherously tries to shoot the American but the Professor’s
Son disarms him with his bayonet.  The three Hun soldiers offer a
show of resistance.
The Streetcleaner’s Son—(To first Hun soldier)—Your hands are
unclean with the murder of innocent women and children.
First Hun Soldier—(Dropping his gun)—Kamerad!
The Pawnbroker’s Son—(To the other Hun soldiers)— Prussianism
has destroyed the Germany of Bach and Beethoven and you fellows
know it, too.
Second and third Hun Soldiers—(Dropping their guns)—Kamerad!
The American Lieutenant—Men—you have kept the faith. I am proud
of you.  Forward!
 An explosion (not too loud to annoy the audience) is heard off
stage right.
The Professor’s Son—(Sinking to the ground) Fellows, I’m afraid
they’ve got me.
The Streetcleaner’s Son—What a shame!
The Lieutenant—Is there anything we can do to ease the pain?
The Professor’s Son—(Weakening rapidly) No—go on, boys, carry
the—banner of—civilization’s ideals—forward—without me— Tell
mother I’m glad—I did—my bit—for the freedom— of the
world—fellows, the only—thing—I regret—is that I won’t— be
able to be with you—when you—go back—to enjoy the gratitude—
of America—good-bye, fellows, may you drink—to the full— the
rewards of a grateful nation.
He dies.  The others regretfully leave him behind as they push on
after the fleeing Huns.
The stage is slowly darkened—the noise of battle dies away.
Enter an Angel in the uniform of the Y.M.C.A. She goes up to the
fallen hero and taking him in her arms tenderly carries him off
the stage.
CURTAIN
TWO YEARS PASS
SCENE I
 The bedroom of a bachelor apartment in New York City in the Fall
of 1920.
There is about the room an air of neglect, as though the occupant
did not particularly give a damn whether he slept in this room or
in hell. This is evidenced in a general way by the absence of any
attempts at decoration and by the presence of dirty laundry and
unopened letters scattered about the room.
The furniture consists of a bed and a bureau; at the foot of the
former is a trunk such as was used by American army officers in
the recent war.
Although it is three in the morning, the bed is unoccupied. The
electric light over the bureau has been left lighted.
The lamp flickers and goes out for a minute; when it again
flashes on, the Angel and the Professor’s Son are seen standing
in the room, as though they had come there directly from the
close of the preceding act; the Angel, however, has completely
removed all Y.M.C.A. insignia and now has a beard and chews
tobacco; from time to time he spits out of the window.
The angel—Why the hell weren’t you satisfied to stay in heaven?
The Professor’s Son—Well, I just wanted to see my old buddies
once more— I want to see them enjoying the gratitude of the
world.
The Angel—Hmmmm—well, this is where your Lieutenant now lives—
and I think I hear him coming.
 They step behind a curtain.  The noise of a key rattling in a
lock is heard, then a light flashes on in the next room. The
sound of unsteady footsteps—a vase is knocked over—a curse—
then enter the Lieutenant.
He wears a dinner-coat, one sleeve of which hangs empty. His face
is white, his eyes set, his mouth hard and hopeless. He is
drunk—not hilariously—but with the drunkenness of despair.
He sits down on the bed and remains for several minutes, his head
in his hands.
The Lieutenant—God, I’m drunk—(after a pause)— drunk
again—well, what of it—what the hell difference does it
make—get drunk if I want to—sure I will—get drunk— that’s the
dope DRUNK—oh Christ!—
He throws himself on the bed and after lying there a few minutes
sits up.
The Lieutenant—Gotta have another drink—can’t go sleep, God
damn it—brain too clear—gotta kill brain—that’s the dope—
kill brain—forget—wipe out past—
He opens the trunk in his search for liquor.  He suddenly pulls
out his lieutenant’s coat and holds it up,
The Lieutenant—There’s that God damn thing—never wanted to see
it again— wound stripes on right sleeve, too—hurrah for brave
soldier—arm shot off to—to make world safe for
democracy—blaa—the god damn hypocrites— democracy hell—arm
shot off because I wasn’t clever enough to stay out of it—ought
to have had sense enough to join the—the ordinance department
or—or the Y.M.C.A.
He feels aimlessly through the pockets of the coat.  Suddenly,
from the inside breast pocket he draws out something—a
photograph—
The Lieutenant—Ellen!  Oh God!
He gazes at the picture for a long time.
The Lieutenant—Yes, Ellen, I should have joined the Y.M.C.A.
shouldn’t I?—where they don’t get their arms shot off— couldn’t
marry a man with one arm, could you?—of course not— think of
looking at an empty sleeve year after year— children might be
born with only one arm, too—children—oh God damn you, Ellen,
you and your Y.M.C.A. husband!
 He tears the picture in two and hurls it into the trunk. Then he
sinks onto the bed, sobbing drunkenly.  After a few minutes, he
walks over to the trunk and picks up one half of the torn
picture. He turns it over in his hand and reads the writing on
the back.
The Lieutenant (Reading)—"I’m waiting for you, dear—when you
have done your bit ’for the freedom of the world’.”
He smiles, wearily, and reaches down to pick up the other half of
the picture.  His eye is caught by something shiny; it is his
army revolver. He slowly picks it up and looks at it for a long
time.
The Lieutenant—For the freedom of the world—
He quickly opens his top bureau drawer and takes out a box of
cartridges. One of these he inserts in a chamber of his revolver.
The Lieutenant—For the FREEDOM—
He laughs.
As the curtain falls he presses the revolver against his temple
and fires.
SCENE 2
 A bare room in a boarding house.  To the left is a bed, to the
right a grand piano—the latter curiously out of keeping with the
other cheap furnishings. The room is in partial darkness.
The door slowly swings open; the Angel and the Professor’s Son
enter.
The Angel—And here you have the room of your friend the
Pawnbroker’s Son— the musical genius—with a brilliant future.
They hide in a closet, leaving the door partly open.
Enter Jean, the Pawnbroker’s Son.  He has on a cutaway suit— a
relic of his first and last public concert before the war. His
shoulders sag dejectedly and his face is drawn and white. He
comes in and sits on the bed.  A knock—a determined knock— is
heard at the door but Jean does not move.  The door opens and his
landlady—a shrewish, sharp faced woman of 40—appears. He gets
up off the bed when he sees her and bows.
The Landlady—I forgot you was deef or I wouldn’t have wasted my
time hitting my knuckles against your door.
Jean gazes at her.
The Landlady—Well Mr. Rosen I guess you know why I’m here— it’s
pay up today or get out.
Jean—Please write it down—you know I cannot hear a word you
say. I suppose it’s about the rent.
The landlady takes paper and pencil and writes.
The Landlady—(Reading over the result of her labor)—
“To-day—is—the—last day.  If you can’t pay, you must get out “
She hands it to Jean and he reads.
Jean—But I cannot pay.  Next week perhaps I shall get work—
The Landlady—(Scornfully)—Yes—Next week maybe I have to sell
another liberty bond for seventy dollars what I paid a hundred
dollars for, too. No sir I need the money NOW.  Here—
 She writes and hands it to him.
Jean (Reading)—Sell my piano?  But please I cannot do that—yet.
The Landlady—A lot of good a piano does a deef person like you.
That’s a good one—( She laughs harshly). The deef musician—ho
ho— with a piano.
Jean—Madam, I shall pay you surely next week. There has been
some delay in my war risk insurance payment. I should think that
you would trust a soldier who lost his hearing in the trenches—
The Landlady—That’s old stuff.  You soldiers think just because
you were unlucky enough to get drafted you can spend the rest of
your life patting yourselves on the back.  Besides—what good did
the war do anyway— except make a lot of rich people richer?
She scribbles emphatically “Either you pay up tonight or out you
go.”
Handing this to Jean with a flourish, she exits.
 He sits on the bed for a long time.
Finally he glances up at the wall over his bed where hangs a
cheap photo frame.  In the center is a picture of President
Wilson; on one side of this is a crude print of a soldier, on the
other side a sailor; above is the inscription “For the Freedom of
the World.”
Jean takes down the picture and looks at it.  As he replaces it
on the wall he sees hanging above it the bayonet which he had
carried through the war. He slowly takes the weapon down, runs
his fingers along the edge and smiles—a quiet tired smile which
does not leave his face during the rest of the scene.
He walks over to the piano and plays the opening chords of the
Schumann concerto.  Then shaking his head sadly, he tenderly
closes down the lid and locks it.
He next writes a note which he folds and places, with the key to
the piano, in an envelope.  Sealing and addressing the envelope,
he places it on the piano.  Then, walking over to the bed, he
picks up the bayonet, and shutting his eyes for an instant, he
steps forward and cuts his throat as the curtain falls.
SCENE 3
 Same as Act 1, Scene 1 except for the changes made in the city
street by a year or more of peace.
The arch across the thoroughfare still stands, although it has
become badly discolored and dirty; the inscription “For the
Freedom of the World” is but faintly visible.  As the curtain
rises workmen are busy at work tearing the arch down.
 Enter the Angel and the Professor’s Son.
The Angel—Stand over here, out of the way, and you’ll see the
last of your cronies—Pat, the Streetcleaner’s Son— enjoying the
gratitude of the world.
The Professor’s Son does not answer.
 Enter Pat.  He has on an old pair of corduroy trousers, with his
brown army shirt, and shoes out at the heel.
He looks as if he had not slept for days certainly he has not
shaved for a week.  He approaches one of the workmen.
Pat—Say buddy any chance for a job here?
The Workman—Hell no.  They was fifty applicants yesterday.
(Looking at his army shirt) Most of them ex-soldiers like you.
Jobs is mighty scarce.
Pat—I’ll tell the world they are.  I’d almost join the army
again, except for my wife and kid.
The Workman—God—don’t do it.
Pat—Why—was you across?
The Workman—Yes, God damn it—eight months.  Next war I’ll let
somebody else do the fighting.
Pat—Same here.  The wise guys were them that stayed at home and
kept their jobs.
The Workman—I’ll say they were.
Pat—(Growing more excited)—And while we was over there
fighting, nothing was too good for us—"brave boys,” they said,
“we shall never forget what you have done for us.” Never
forget—hell!  In about a year everybody forgot there ever was a
war and a fellow has a hell of a time getting a job—and when you
mention the war they just laugh—why God damn it, I’ve been out
of work for six months and I ain’t no loafer either and my wife
has had to go back to her folks and I’m just about all in—
 During this speech the work on dismantling the arch has steadily
progressed. Suddenly there comes a warning cry—"Look out"—as
the supports unexpectedly give way.  Pat is too engrossed in his
tirade to take heed, and as the center portion of the arch falls
it crushes him beneath its weight. After the cloud of dust
clears, he is seen lying under the mass. By a curious twist of
fate he has been crushed by the portion of the arch bearing the
inscription “For the Freedom of the World.”  His eyes open for an
instant—he reads, through the mist of approaching death, the
words, and he laughs—
Pat—For the Freedom of the World—Oh Christ!
His mocking laughter is interrupted by a severe fit of coughing
and he sinks back dead.
The Professor’s Son—Oh God—take me somewhere where I can’t ever
see the world.
The angel—Come to heaven.
