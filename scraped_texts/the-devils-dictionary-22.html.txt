UBIQUITY, n.  The gift or power of being in all places at one time, 
but not in all places at all times, which is omnipresence, an 
attribute of God and the luminiferous ether only.  This important 
distinction between ubiquity and omnipresence was not clear to the 
mediaeval Church and there was much bloodshed about it.  Certain 
Lutherans, who affirmed the presence everywhere of Christ’s body were 
known as Ubiquitarians.  For this error they were doubtless damned, 
for Christ’s body is present only in the eucharist, though that 
sacrament may be performed in more than one place simultaneously.  In 
recent times ubiquity has not always been understood — not even by 
Sir Boyle Roche, for example, who held that a man cannot be in two 
places at once unless he is a bird.
UGLINESS, n.  A gift of the gods to certain women, entailing virtue 
without humility.
ULTIMATUM, n.  In diplomacy, a last demand before resorting to 
concessions.
  Having received an ultimatum from Austria, the Turkish Ministry 
met to consider it.
  “O servant of the Prophet,” said the Sheik of the Imperial Chibouk 
to the Mamoosh of the Invincible Army, “how many unconquerable 
soldiers have we in arms?"
  “Upholder of the Faith,” that dignitary replied after examining 
his memoranda, “they are in numbers as the leaves of the forest!"
  “And how many impenetrable battleships strike terror to the hearts 
of all Christian swine?” he asked the Imaum of the Ever Victorious 
Navy.
  “Uncle of the Full Moon,” was the reply, “deign to know that they 
are as the waves of the ocean, the sands of the desert and the stars 
of Heaven!"
  For eight hours the broad brow of the Sheik of the Imperial 
Chibouk was corrugated with evidences of deep thought:  he was 
calculating the chances of war.  Then, “Sons of angels,” he said, “the 
die is cast!  I shall suggest to the Ulema of the Imperial Ear that he 
advise inaction.  In the name of Allah, the council is adjourned.”
UN-AMERICAN, adj.  Wicked, intolerable, heathenish.
UNCTION, n.  An oiling, or greasing.  The rite of extreme unction 
consists in touching with oil consecrated by a bishop several parts of 
the body of one engaged in dying.  Marbury relates that after the rite 
had been administered to a certain wicked English nobleman it was 
discovered that the oil had not been properly consecrated and no other 
could be obtained.  When informed of this the sick man said in anger:  
“Then I’ll be damned if I die!"
  “My son,” said the priest, “this is what we fear.”
UNDERSTANDING, n.  A cerebral secretion that enables one having it to 
know a house from a horse by the roof on the house.  Its nature and 
laws have been exhaustively expounded by Locke, who rode a house, and 
Kant, who lived in a horse.
  His understanding was so keen
  That all things which he’d felt, heard, seen,
  He could interpret without fail
  If he was in or out of jail.
  He wrote at Inspiration’s call
  Deep disquisitions on them all,
  Then, pent at last in an asylum,
  Performed the service to compile ’em.
  So great a writer, all men swore,
  They never had not read before.
Jorrock Wormley

UNITARIAN, n.  One who denies the divinity of a Trinitarian.
UNIVERSALIST, n.  One who forgoes the advantage of a Hell for persons 
of another faith.
URBANITY, n.  The kind of civility that urban observers ascribe to 
dwellers in all cities but New York.  Its commonest expression is 
heard in the words, “I beg your pardon,” and it is not consistent with 
disregard of the rights of others.
  The owner of a powder mill
  Was musing on a distant hill —
      Something his mind foreboded —
  When from the cloudless sky there fell
  A deviled human kidney!  Well,
      The man’s mill had exploded.
  His hat he lifted from his head;
  “I beg your pardon, sir,” he said;
      “I didn’t know ’twas loaded.”
Swatkin

USAGE, n.  The First Person of the literary Trinity, the Second and 
Third being Custom and Conventionality.  Imbued with a decent 
reverence for this Holy Triad an industrious writer may hope to 
produce books that will live as long as the fashion.
UXORIOUSNESS, n.  A perverted affection that has strayed to one’s own 
wife.
