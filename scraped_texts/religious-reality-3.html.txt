Vital religion begins for a man when lie first discovers the reality
of the living GOD. Most men indeed profess a belief in GOD, a vague
acknowledgment of the existence of “One above”: but the belief counts
for little in their lives.
GOD, if He exists at all, must obviously be important: and it is
conceivable that He prefers the dogmatic atheism of a man here and a
man there, or the serious agnosticism of a slightly larger number, to
the practical indifference of the majority. “There are two attitudes,
and only two, which are worthy of a serious man: to serve GOD with his
whole heart, because he knows Him; or to seek GOD with his whole
heart, because he knows Him not.”
The ordinary Englishman is in most cases nominally a Christian. As a
rule he has been admitted in infancy by baptism into the Christian
Church. But he is ignorant of the implications of his baptism, and
indifferent to the claims of a religion which he fails to understand.

writer’s judgment, the faith and practice of the Christian Church
really is.
