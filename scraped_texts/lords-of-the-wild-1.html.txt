The Lords of the Wild - A Story of the Old New York Border
by
Joseph A. Altsheler
“The Lords of the Wild” tells a complete story, but it is also a part
of the French and Indian War Series, of which the predecessors were
“The Hunters of the Hills,” “The Shadow of the North,” “The Rulers
of the Lakes” and “The Masters of the Peaks.” Robert Lennox, Tayoga,
Willet, St. Luc, Tandakora and all the principal characters of the
earlier volumes reappear.
