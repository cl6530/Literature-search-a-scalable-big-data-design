God hath made all things in the world, nay, the world
itself, free from hindrance and perfect, and its parts for the
use of the whole. No other creature is capable of comprehending
His administration thereof; but the reasonable being Man
possesses faculties for the consideration of all these thingsâ€”
not only that he is himself a part, but what part he is, and how
it is meet that the parts should give place to the whole. Nor is
this all. Being naturally constituted noble, magnanimous, and
free, he sees that the things which surround him are of two
kinds. Some are free from hindrance and in the power of the will.
Others are subject to hindrance, and depend on the will of other
men. If then he place his own good, his own best interest, only
in that which is free from hindrance and in his power, he will be
free, tranquil, happy, unharmed, noble-hearted, and pious; giving
thanks for all things unto God, finding fault with nothing that
comes to pass, laying no charge against anything. Whereas if he
place his good in outward things, depending not on the will, he
must perforce be subject to hindrance and restraint, the slave of
those that have power over the things he desires and fears; he
must perforce be impious, as deeming himself injured at the hands
of God; he must be unjust, as ever prone to claim more than his
due; he must perforce be of a mean and abject spirit.
