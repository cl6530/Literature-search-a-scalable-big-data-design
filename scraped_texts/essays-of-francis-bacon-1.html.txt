Francis Bacon (1561-1626)




To
The Right Honorable
My Very Good Lord
the Duke of Buckingham
His Grace, Lord
High Admiral of England
Excellent Lord:
SALOMON saies; A good Name is as a precious
oyntment; And I assure my selfe, such wil
your Graces Name bee, with Posteritie.  For your
Fortune, and Merit both, have been Eminent.  And
you have planted Things, that are like to last.  I doe
now publish my Essayes; which, of all my other
workes, have beene most Currant: For that, as it
seemes, they come home, to Mens Businesse, and
Bosomes.  I have enlarged them, both in Number,
and Weight; So that they are indeed a New Worke.
I thought it therefore agreeable, to my Affection,
and Obligation to your Grace, to prefix your Name
before them, both in English, and in Latine.  For I
doe conceive, that the Latine Volume of them,
(being in the Universall Language) may last, as
long as Bookes last.  My Instauration, I dedicated to
the King: My Historie of Henry the Seventh,
(which I have now also translated into Latine) and
my Portions of Naturall History, to the Prince:
And these I dedicate to your Grace; Being of the
best Fruits, that by the good Encrease, which God
gives to my Pen and Labours, I could yeeld.
God leade your Grace by the Hand.  Your Graces
most Obliged and faithfull Servant,
Fr. Sr. Alban
