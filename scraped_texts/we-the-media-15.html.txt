Notes
introduction
1. Esther Dyson’s column about Nacchio incident can be found at http:// www.edventure.com/conversation/article.cfm?Counter=8648145.
2. I’m convinced Nacchio was perfectly capable of annoying the audience all by himself. Clay Shirky, also in the room that day, felt the mood shifting, and wondered why until someone pointed out the blogging on a nearby computer screen. He told me:
Now, normally, a blog entry like this would take a day or so to ripple outwards, but because this was such a wired crowd and, frankly, because Nacchio’s talk was so dull, a lot of people were catching up on their blog reading during the talk, and even people not reading were near people who were. So the whole thing, from discovery to publication to spread, got really compressed, and basically happened during the time he was onstage.
chapter 1, from tom paine to blogs and beyond

4.
Bimber also observes that the Founders based their new nation essentially on information. An informed electorate was necessary to self-government. The Federalist papers, newspapers, and other writings were the beginnings of the world’s first information-based society.

5.
Tom Standage’s The Victorian Internet (1998) observes the remarkable similarities in rise of 19th-century telegraph networks and the modern Internet, including stock market bubbles, absurd predictions, and, in the end, the rise of an enormously powerful tool for communications (http:// www.tomstandage.com).

7.
In the early 1970s, big newspaper companies persuaded Congress to pass a newspaper preservation law that limited antitrust enforcement. The law let competing newspapers merge their advertising, printing, and circulation staffs while maintaining separate newsrooms and publishing two papers. My company, Knight Ridder, enjoys the fruits of several such Joint Operat­ing Agreements, as they’re called. If there was ever a justification for this law, which is doubtful, the Net makes it less justifiable now. The nation would be better off if the law was repealed.

8.
Direct mail has also pulled advertisers away in large numbers, notes Stephen B. Waters, publisher of the Rome Sentinel in upstate New York. In 1979 they rejiggered the rates to begin to suck up advertising to keep postponing until the next elections a day of reckoning because of a bloated, expensive labor force, he wrote me. The advertising dollar has gone to Direct Marketing, not radio and television. It still is the case.

9.
I rely on somewhat fading memory, not archives, for the details of my

XyWrite programming-assistance story.



10.
Usenet newsgroups live on today in many forms, including Google Groups (http://groups.google.com).

11.
Left-wing groups were also using these systems to organize, but from my observations at the time, not as effectively.

12.
The MIDI standard (http://www.midi.org) revolutionized music, and con­tinues to do so.

13.
For example, see the Pacific News Service (http://news.pacificnews.org/ news/).

16.
Being available worldwide isn’t the same as being seen worldwide. In his essay, Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality (http://www.shirky.com/ writings/powerlaw_weblog.html), Clay Shirky observes that in a system such as the blog arena, where many people are free to choose between many options, a small subset of the whole will get a disproportionate amount of traffic (or attention, or income), even if no members of the sys­tem actively work towards such an outcome. This has nothing to do with moral weakness, selling out, or any other psychological explanation. The very act of choosing, spread widely enough and freely enough, creates a power law distribution. But he adds that newcomers can gain significant audiences nonetheless.

In the early 1990s, after many of the core pieces of Stallman’s software project had been created, Torvalds, then a Finnish college student, wrote a kernel, the core element of what became Linux. It’s important to recog­nize, as Torvalds gladly does, that Linux derived from Stallman’s original vision.

25.
Stallman and others in the free software movement strongly object to the open source terminology. For more on why, visit the Free Software Foundation’s site (http://www.fsf.org).

26.
Proprietary software makers and some security experts dispute this, saying open code is not inherently safer. But security through obscurity is plainly not a workable answer, either.

29. Leonard Witt , professor of communications at Kennesaw State University in Georgia (http://www.kennesaw.edu/communication/witt.shtml), persua­sively argues that blogs and other bottom-up journalism are doing what advocates of public journalismthe idea that journalists have an obliga­tion to further civic discourse and improvementhave been pushing for years, with limited interest from professional journalists. Witt says interme­diaries are no longer needed as public journalism morphs into the public’s journalism. See the essay by blogger Tim Porter, who delves deeply into these subjects, for more on this notion (http://www.timporter.com/firstdraft/ archives/000246.html).

chapter 2, the read-write web
35. The Guardian, one of the most prominent national newspapers in the United Kingdom, offers thoughtful, hard-hitting journalism from a slightly left-of-center perspective. In the weeks before the 2003 Iraq war, the site saw a big increase in visitors. This happened to most serious newspapers, but The Guardian’s traffic boost came in large part from Americans. What were they looking for? No one is absolutely certain, but Simon Waldman, who runs The Guardian’s online operations, told me he believed many of the American visitors were looking for something they couldn’t find in the
U.S. press: a different perspective from the relentlessly pro-war coverage
263
they were seeing at home. I leaned in favor of the war, but I was appalled at the lack of nuance in American journalism during a time when about half the population opposed the war.

98. The assumption of accuracy is not automatic, and the Pentagon severely compromised its credibility in April 2004 in a similar circumstance. According to The Washington Post (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28729-2004Apr20.html), the Defense Department deleted from a public transcript a statement Defense Secretary Donald H. Rums­feld made to author Bob Woodward suggesting that the administration gave Saudi Arabia a two-month heads-up that President Bush had decided to invade Iraq. Woodward provided his own transcript. Will journalists and sources be posting dueling transcripts in the future?

125. At a dinner in Vermont while I was visiting the campaign, an old friend of Dean’s (and mine; I lived in Vermont for almost 15 years until the mid­1980s) turned to me as I was describing my positive impressions of the Dean Internet activities and said, But Howard’s such a Luddite. Ver­monters, I discovered, were amused by the former governor’s Net savvy, because he’d been reluctant, at best, to bring the most advanced technol­ogy into state government until well into his latter terms. Another person at the table offered, But he learns fast.

168. Minnesota Public Radio’s Michael Skoler put it well in an interview on Leonard Witt’s Public Journalism blog (http://pjnet.org/weblogs/ pjnettoday/archives/000172.html) when he said: If establishment’ media organizations can plug into the energy and wisdom of the collective brain of the public, we’ll bring the strength of traditional journalismeditorial judgment, fact-checking, truth-seekinginto a new age of better, more trusted news coverage. If we don’t do this, I think the unfiltered, weblog­type model of journalism will overtake traditional media with its sheer energy and we will lose a powerful way of informing the public about criti­cal issues in our democracy.

176. Could an OhmyNews-like operation work in the United States and other countries? It’s difficult to know, in part because there are different legal issues. But the indications are that the potential is there. One of the best
U.S. community news sites I’ve seen is called iBrattleboro (http:// www.ibrattleboro.com), based in Brattleboro, Vermont, where the daily quasi-monopoly newspaper is owned by one of the more rapacious chains. From my distant perspective, iBrattleboro consistently covers important events and issues that the newspaper all but ignores.

CNET’s News.com service (http://www.news.com) has been a stalwart of excellent tech coverage, as has The Register (http:// www.theregister.co.uk), a British-based site that is both smart and sassy in its coverage. Both sites are essential reading for tech journalists.

As Hal Varian and Carl Shapiro noted in their important 1999 book, Information Rules (Harvard Business School Press), Metcalfe’s Law relies on what economists call network externalities. This is the notion that the larger the network, the more attractive it will be to users in most cases and the harder it will be for a new entrant in the market to get people to switch.

http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0403/dis_light.html.
245. This is not a new phenomenon. As Paul Martin Lester, communications
professor at California State University at Fullerton, observes (http://
commfaculty.fullerton.edu/lester/writings/faking.html):
Photojournalism, photography that accompanies stories intended
for newspaper and magazine readers, has a long and cherished
tradition of truthfulness. The faking of photographs, either
through stage direction by the photographer or through
darkroom manipulation, unfortunately, also has a long tradition.
As a result, Pulitzer Prize-winning images, photographs that have
moved people to action, and pictures that have been hailed as
beautiful humanistic documents filled with hope mud joy, have
been questioned. Consequently, their impact has been
diminished by charges of photographic faking. Such accusations
are usually easily proven unsubstantiated and are the exception
rather than the rule for photojournalism images. However,
computer technology puts photographic faking on a new level of
concern as images can be digitized and manipulated without the
slightest indication of such trickery.

253. Some people who comment on my blog have said they choose to use phony email addresses so that spammers can’t scrape their email addresses off their postings. This is a valid concern. Spammers are always looking for new email addresses and regularly spider forums and blogs for email addresses. Forum and blogging software is improving, however, and it’ll soon be more difficult for a spammer’s software to effectively scrape email addresses off comment postings.

For example, as another commenter observed in the Wicked Good dis­cussion of New Media Strategies, the firm worked with the Burger King fast-food chain to get the word out about a potentially harmful toy being given to small children: NMS’ innovative one-on-one corporate communi­cations strategy instantly reached millions of concerned parents and earned Burger King praise from both customers and the Consumer Products Safety Commission.
260. Ken Layne blog: http://www.kenlayne.com.
261. In 2002, an article in The Guardian attributed the Lane quote to Glenn Reynolds, who posted this funny but relevant item on his blog: While I do say fact check your ass’ from time to time, it’s Ken Layne who coined the term. This article from The Guardian gives the impression that the term is uniquely mine, which it isn’teither by origination or by frequency of use. Hey, I just fact-checked the ass’ of an article over the phrase fact-check-ing your ass.’ I think that should get me the recursive metablogging medal of the day. Or at least a good seed in the recursive metablogging tourna­ment.

That was a no brainer to accept in the settlement, as any story I would write about him he would know of well before 42 hours because I’d be calling him to ask him ques­tions. In addition, the agreement lasted 18 months, and in any event Meeks didn’t write about the company again.
267. Blogger and law professor Glenn Reynolds says: To be libelous, a state­ment must be (1) a statement of fact, not opinion; (2) false; and (3) such as to materially injure someone’s reputation. The standard is higher for pub­lic figures, who have to show that the writer had reckless disregard for whether the statement was true.

It’s due at least as much to a reduction in the number of releases and the overall lower quality of music being promoted today, as well as incredibly high prices. Moreover, a deeply researched study (http:// www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf) by professors at Harvard Business School and the University of North Carolina concluded that file sharing has no obvious impact on salesand that it may actually help promote the music.

300. I recommend two superbly researched papers that explain the dangerous confluence of privacy and digital rights management: DRM and Privacy (http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/drm/papers/cohen-drmandprivacy-btlj2003.html) by Julie E. Cohen, professor of law at Geor­getown University Law Center; and the more recent The New Surveil­lance (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=527003) by Sonia Katyal, associate professor at Fordham University School of Law.
301. Patricia Schroeder, a former member of Congress who went on to head the publishing industry’s main lobbying organization, famously told The Washington Post in 2001 (http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/ A36584-2001Feb7), We have a very serious issue with librarians. I’ve shown this quote to people on many occasions, and the universal response has been sheer disbelief at Schroeder’s statement.
302. Congress is moving closer to outlawing peer-to-peer outright, and the entertainment industry keeps suing everyone in sight. In one case, a record company sued a Silicon Valley investor in Napster, alleging contributory infringement; that case has yet to go to trial.

304. And indeed, Apple has taken things away. In late April 2004, it released an iTunes update that, when installed, removed functionality from the soft­ware while adding new features. I fully expect that Apple will continue to do this.

310. Throughout this section, I’ve used the word content in the broadest sensethat which is created by anyone, not just the entertainment indus­try. Indeed, it’s crucial to recognize that the content users create is more important than what Hollywood creates, especially as we contemplate the architecture of future networks. See Andrew Odlyzko’s paper, Content is Not King, for more on this: http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/ odlyzko/#o9.

313. The interstates are an intriguing mirror image of what’s required with data. In the 1950s, America’s state and local highways were well-developed. What we needed, and what corporate America couldn’t provide, was a sys­tem of long-distance roads. Today, the reverse is true: the long-distance data highways, the backbone networks, exist in abundance. It’s the local roads we need, right up to our homes. Big telecom carriers say they’ll pro­vide these connections only if we allow them to control the content that flows on those lines. Imagine if we’d given the interstates to corporations that could decide what kinds of vehicular traffic could use them.

322. Microsoft Word was both useful and infuriating. The Mac version seems to have a severe bug that caused me and my editor no end of trouble. If there was a serious alternative, I’d use it. I note this because I posted a blog com­ment about the problems I was having, and related what Microsoft’s tech­nical support people had told me. (Amazingly, they advised against saving the files in Microsoft’s own format.) My blog posting generated an email from one of the programmers at Microsoft who works on the Mac applica­tions. He asked for samples of the corrupted files and said he’d try to fig­ure out what was wrong. I sent the files but didn’t hear back from him. Nonetheless, his query was another example of how the new world of information works: he, at least, was paying attention to what was going on in the online world, because it affected his product. I give Microsoft an A for this, even if I give its software a C-minus for its flaws.

Notes
introduction
1. Esther Dyson’s column about Nacchio incident can be found at http:// www.edventure.com/conversation/article.cfm?Counter=8648145.
2. I’m convinced Nacchio was perfectly capable of annoying the audience all by himself. Clay Shirky, also in the room that day, felt the mood shifting, and wondered why until someone pointed out the blogging on a nearby computer screen. He told me:
Now, normally, a blog entry like this would take a day or so to ripple outwards, but because this was such a wired crowd and, frankly, because Nacchio’s talk was so dull, a lot of people were catching up on their blog reading during the talk, and even people not reading were near people who were. So the whole thing, from discovery to publication to spread, got really compressed, and basically happened during the time he was onstage.

Bimber also observes that the Founders based their new nation essentially on information. An informed electorate was necessary to self-government. The Federalist papers, newspapers, and other writings were the beginnings of the world’s first information-based society.

5.
Tom Standage’s The Victorian Internet (1998) observes the remarkable similarities in rise of 19th-century telegraph networks and the modern Internet, including stock market bubbles, absurd predictions, and, in the end, the rise of an enormously powerful tool for communications (http:// www.tomstandage.com).

7.
In the early 1970s, big newspaper companies persuaded Congress to pass a newspaper preservation law that limited antitrust enforcement. The law let competing newspapers merge their advertising, printing, and circulation staffs while maintaining separate newsrooms and publishing two papers. My company, Knight Ridder, enjoys the fruits of several such Joint Operat­ing Agreements, as they’re called. If there was ever a justification for this law, which is doubtful, the Net makes it less justifiable now. The nation would be better off if the law was repealed.

8.
Direct mail has also pulled advertisers away in large numbers, notes Stephen B. Waters, publisher of the Rome Sentinel in upstate New York. In 1979 they rejiggered the rates to begin to suck up advertising to keep postponing until the next elections a day of reckoning because of a bloated, expensive labor force, he wrote me. The advertising dollar has gone to Direct Marketing, not radio and television. It still is the case.

Usenet newsgroups live on today in many forms, including Google Groups (http://groups.google.com).

11.
Left-wing groups were also using these systems to organize, but from my observations at the time, not as effectively.

The MIDI standard (http://www.midi.org) revolutionized music, and con­tinues to do so.

Being available worldwide isn’t the same as being seen worldwide. In his essay, Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality (http://www.shirky.com/ writings/powerlaw_weblog.html), Clay Shirky observes that in a system such as the blog arena, where many people are free to choose between many options, a small subset of the whole will get a disproportionate amount of traffic (or attention, or income), even if no members of the sys­tem actively work towards such an outcome. This has nothing to do with moral weakness, selling out, or any other psychological explanation. The very act of choosing, spread widely enough and freely enough, creates a power law distribution. But he adds that newcomers can gain significant audiences nonetheless.

In the early 1990s, after many of the core pieces of Stallman’s software project had been created, Torvalds, then a Finnish college student, wrote a kernel, the core element of what became Linux. It’s important to recog­nize, as Torvalds gladly does, that Linux derived from Stallman’s original vision.

25.
Stallman and others in the free software movement strongly object to the open source terminology. For more on why, visit the Free Software Foundation’s site (http://www.fsf.org).

26.
Proprietary software makers and some security experts dispute this, saying open code is not inherently safer. But security through obscurity is plainly not a workable answer, either.

29. Leonard Witt , professor of communications at Kennesaw State University in Georgia (http://www.kennesaw.edu/communication/witt.shtml), persua­sively argues that blogs and other bottom-up journalism are doing what advocates of public journalismthe idea that journalists have an obliga­tion to further civic discourse and improvementhave been pushing for years, with limited interest from professional journalists. Witt says interme­diaries are no longer needed as public journalism morphs into the public’s journalism. See the essay by blogger Tim Porter, who delves deeply into these subjects, for more on this notion (http://www.timporter.com/firstdraft/ archives/000246.html).

chapter 2, the read-write web
35. The Guardian, one of the most prominent national newspapers in the United Kingdom, offers thoughtful, hard-hitting journalism from a slightly left-of-center perspective. In the weeks before the 2003 Iraq war, the site saw a big increase in visitors. This happened to most serious newspapers, but The Guardian’s traffic boost came in large part from Americans. What were they looking for? No one is absolutely certain, but Simon Waldman, who runs The Guardian’s online operations, told me he believed many of the American visitors were looking for something they couldn’t find in the
U.S. press: a different perspective from the relentlessly pro-war coverage
263
they were seeing at home. I leaned in favor of the war, but I was appalled at the lack of nuance in American journalism during a time when about half the population opposed the war.

98. The assumption of accuracy is not automatic, and the Pentagon severely compromised its credibility in April 2004 in a similar circumstance. According to The Washington Post (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28729-2004Apr20.html), the Defense Department deleted from a public transcript a statement Defense Secretary Donald H. Rums­feld made to author Bob Woodward suggesting that the administration gave Saudi Arabia a two-month heads-up that President Bush had decided to invade Iraq. Woodward provided his own transcript. Will journalists and sources be posting dueling transcripts in the future?

At a dinner in Vermont while I was visiting the campaign, an old friend of Dean’s (and mine; I lived in Vermont for almost 15 years until the mid­1980s) turned to me as I was describing my positive impressions of the Dean Internet activities and said, But Howard’s such a Luddite. Ver­monters, I discovered, were amused by the former governor’s Net savvy, because he’d been reluctant, at best, to bring the most advanced technol­ogy into state government until well into his latter terms. Another person at the table offered, But he learns fast.

168. Minnesota Public Radio’s Michael Skoler put it well in an interview on Leonard Witt’s Public Journalism blog (http://pjnet.org/weblogs/ pjnettoday/archives/000172.html) when he said: If establishment’ media organizations can plug into the energy and wisdom of the collective brain of the public, we’ll bring the strength of traditional journalismeditorial judgment, fact-checking, truth-seekinginto a new age of better, more trusted news coverage. If we don’t do this, I think the unfiltered, weblog­type model of journalism will overtake traditional media with its sheer energy and we will lose a powerful way of informing the public about criti­cal issues in our democracy.

176. Could an OhmyNews-like operation work in the United States and other countries? It’s difficult to know, in part because there are different legal issues. But the indications are that the potential is there. One of the best
U.S. community news sites I’ve seen is called iBrattleboro (http:// www.ibrattleboro.com), based in Brattleboro, Vermont, where the daily quasi-monopoly newspaper is owned by one of the more rapacious chains. From my distant perspective, iBrattleboro consistently covers important events and issues that the newspaper all but ignores.

Tech­nology has been a prime example of how cyberspace, where speed is of the essence, can beat paper. CNET’s News.com service (http://www.news.com) has been a stalwart of excellent tech coverage, as has The Register (http:// www.theregister.co.uk), a British-based site that is both smart and sassy in its coverage. Both sites are essential reading for tech journalists.

219. In this 2003 CNET interview, Metcalfe talks about the genesis and future of Ethernet: http://news.com.com/2008-1082-1008450.html.
220. As Hal Varian and Carl Shapiro noted in their important 1999 book, Information Rules (Harvard Business School Press), Metcalfe’s Law relies on what economists call network externalities. This is the notion that the larger the network, the more attractive it will be to users in most cases and the harder it will be for a new entrant in the market to get people to switch.

Ken Light, who took the original Kerry picture used for the
composite, discussed the incident on the DigitalJournalist site:
http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0403/dis_light.html.
245. This is not a new phenomenon. As Paul Martin Lester, communications
professor at California State University at Fullerton, observes (http://
commfaculty.fullerton.edu/lester/writings/faking.html):
Photojournalism, photography that accompanies stories intended
for newspaper and magazine readers, has a long and cherished
tradition of truthfulness. The faking of photographs, either
through stage direction by the photographer or through
darkroom manipulation, unfortunately, also has a long tradition.
As a result, Pulitzer Prize-winning images, photographs that have
moved people to action, and pictures that have been hailed as
beautiful humanistic documents filled with hope mud joy, have
been questioned. Consequently, their impact has been
diminished by charges of photographic faking. Such accusations
are usually easily proven unsubstantiated and are the exception
rather than the rule for photojournalism images. However,
computer technology puts photographic faking on a new level of
concern as images can be digitized and manipulated without the
slightest indication of such trickery.

253. Some people who comment on my blog have said they choose to use phony email addresses so that spammers can’t scrape their email addresses off their postings. This is a valid concern. Spammers are always looking for new email addresses and regularly spider forums and blogs for email addresses. Forum and blogging software is improving, however, and it’ll soon be more difficult for a spammer’s software to effectively scrape email addresses off comment postings.
254. Ward Cunningham goes far beyond simply defining trolls. He offers dis­tinctions and good advice on what to do about them: http://c2.com/cgi/ wiki?TrollDefinition.

259. For example, as another commenter observed in the Wicked Good dis­cussion of New Media Strategies, the firm worked with the Burger King fast-food chain to get the word out about a potentially harmful toy being given to small children: NMS’ innovative one-on-one corporate communi­cations strategy instantly reached millions of concerned parents and earned Burger King praise from both customers and the Consumer Products Safety Commission.
260. Ken Layne blog: http://www.kenlayne.com.
261. In 2002, an article in The Guardian attributed the Lane quote to Glenn Reynolds, who posted this funny but relevant item on his blog: While I do say fact check your ass’ from time to time, it’s Ken Layne who coined the term. This article from The Guardian gives the impression that the term is uniquely mine, which it isn’teither by origination or by frequency of use. Hey, I just fact-checked the ass’ of an article over the phrase fact-check-ing your ass.’ I think that should get me the recursive metablogging medal of the day. Or at least a good seed in the recursive metablogging tourna­ment.

266. Meeks told me: There was NO requirement on me to show him anything I was going to publish prior to publishing it. That was a no brainer to accept in the settlement, as any story I would write about him he would know of well before 42 hours because I’d be calling him to ask him ques­tions. In addition, the agreement lasted 18 months, and in any event Meeks didn’t write about the company again.
267. Blogger and law professor Glenn Reynolds says: To be libelous, a state­ment must be (1) a statement of fact, not opinion; (2) false; and (3) such as to materially injure someone’s reputation. The standard is higher for pub­lic figures, who have to show that the writer had reckless disregard for whether the statement was true.

298. The music industry’s difficulties are not due to MP3 file sharing, contrary to the propaganda. It’s due at least as much to a reduction in the number of releases and the overall lower quality of music being promoted today, as well as incredibly high prices. Moreover, a deeply researched study (http:// www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf) by professors at Harvard Business School and the University of North Carolina concluded that file sharing has no obvious impact on salesand that it may actually help promote the music.
299. Wired News’ coverage of Berman’s legislation: http://www.wired.com/ news/politics/0,1283,54153,00.html.
300. I recommend two superbly researched papers that explain the dangerous confluence of privacy and digital rights management: DRM and Privacy (http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/drm/papers/cohen-drmandprivacy-btlj2003.html) by Julie E. Cohen, professor of law at Geor­getown University Law Center; and the more recent The New Surveil­lance (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=527003) by Sonia Katyal, associate professor at Fordham University School of Law.
301. Patricia Schroeder, a former member of Congress who went on to head the publishing industry’s main lobbying organization, famously told The Washington Post in 2001 (http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/ A36584-2001Feb7), We have a very serious issue with librarians. I’ve shown this quote to people on many occasions, and the universal response has been sheer disbelief at Schroeder’s statement.
302. Congress is moving closer to outlawing peer-to-peer outright, and the entertainment industry keeps suing everyone in sight. In one case, a record company sued a Silicon Valley investor in Napster, alleging contributory infringement; that case has yet to go to trial.

304. And indeed, Apple has taken things away. In late April 2004, it released an iTunes update that, when installed, removed functionality from the soft­ware while adding new features. I fully expect that Apple will continue to do this.

310. Throughout this section, I’ve used the word content in the broadest sensethat which is created by anyone, not just the entertainment indus­try. Indeed, it’s crucial to recognize that the content users create is more important than what Hollywood creates, especially as we contemplate the architecture of future networks. See Andrew Odlyzko’s paper, Content is Not King, for more on this: http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/ odlyzko/#o9.

313. The interstates are an intriguing mirror image of what’s required with data. In the 1950s, America’s state and local highways were well-developed. What we needed, and what corporate America couldn’t provide, was a sys­tem of long-distance roads. Today, the reverse is true: the long-distance data highways, the backbone networks, exist in abundance. It’s the local roads we need, right up to our homes. Big telecom carriers say they’ll pro­vide these connections only if we allow them to control the content that flows on those lines. Imagine if we’d given the interstates to corporations that could decide what kinds of vehicular traffic could use them.

322. Microsoft Word was both useful and infuriating. The Mac version seems to have a severe bug that caused me and my editor no end of trouble. If there was a serious alternative, I’d use it. I note this because I posted a blog com­ment about the problems I was having, and related what Microsoft’s tech­nical support people had told me. (Amazingly, they advised against saving the files in Microsoft’s own format.) My blog posting generated an email from one of the programmers at Microsoft who works on the Mac applica­tions. He asked for samples of the corrupted files and said he’d try to fig­ure out what was wrong. I sent the files but didn’t hear back from him. Nonetheless, his query was another example of how the new world of information works: he, at least, was paying attention to what was going on in the online world, because it affected his product. I give Microsoft an A for this, even if I give its software a C-minus for its flaws.
