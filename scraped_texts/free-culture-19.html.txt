The day Eldred was decided, fate would have it that I was to travel to 
Washington, D.C. (The day the rehearing petition in Eldred was deniedmeaning 
the case was really finally overfate would have it that I was giving a speech 
to technologists at Disney World.) This was a particularly long flight to my 
least favorite city. The drive into the city from Dulles was delayed because of 
traffic, so I opened up my computer and wrote an op-ed piece.
It was an act of contrition. During the whole of the flight from San Francisco 
to Washington, I had heard over and over again in my head the same advice from 
Don Ayer: You need to make them see why it is important. And alternating with 
that command was the question of Justice Kennedy: For all these years the act 
has impeded progress in science and the useful arts. I just don’t see any 
empirical evidence for that. And so, having failed in the argument of 
constitutional principle, finally, I turned to an argument of politics.
The New York Times published the piece. In it, I proposed a simple fix: Fifty 
years after a work has been published, the copyright owner would be required to 
register the work and pay a small fee. If he paid the fee, he got the benefit of 
the full term of copyright. If he did not, the work passed into the public 
domain.
We called this the Eldred Act, but that was just to give it a name. Eric Eldred 
was kind enough to let his name be used once again, but as he said early on, it 
won’t get passed unless it has another name.
Or another two names. For depending upon your perspective, this is either the 
Public Domain Enhancement Act or the Copyright Term Deregulation Act. Either 
way, the essence of the idea is clear and obvious: Remove copyright where it is 
doing nothing except blocking access and the spread of knowledge. Leave it for 
as long as Congress allows for those works where its worth is at least $1. But 
for everything else, let the content go.
The reaction to this idea was amazingly strong. Steve Forbes endorsed it in an 
editorial. I received an avalanche of e-mail and letters expressing support. 
When you focus the issue on lost creativity, people can see the copyright system 
makes no sense. As a good Republican might say, here government regulation is 
simply getting in the way of innovation and creativity. And as a good Democrat 
might say, here the government is blocking access and the spread of knowledge 
for no good reason. Indeed, there is no real difference between Democrats and 
Republicans on this issue. Anyone can recognize the stupid harm of the present 
system.
Indeed, many recognized the obvious benefit of the registration requirement. For 
one of the hardest things about the current system for people who want to 
license content is that there is no obvious place to look for the current 
copyright owners. Since registration is not required, since marking content is 
not required, since no formality at all is required, it is often impossibly hard 
to locate copyright owners to ask permission to use or license their work. This 
system would lower these costs, by establishing at least one registry where 
copyright owners could be identified.
As I described in chapter 10, formalities in copyright law were removed in 1976, 
when Congress followed the Europeans by abandoning any formal requirement before 
a copyright is granted. [1] The Europeans are said to view copyright as a 
natural right. Natural rights don’t need forms to exist. Traditions, like the 
Anglo-American tradition that required copyright owners to follow form if their 
rights were to be protected, did not, the Europeans thought, properly respect 
the dignity of the author. My right as a creator turns on my creativity, not 
upon the special favor of the government.
That’s great rhetoric. It sounds wonderfully romantic. But it is absurd 
copyright policy. It is absurd especially for authors, because a world without 
formalities harms the creator. The ability to spread Walt Disney creativity is 
destroyed when there is no simple way to know what’s protected and what’s not.
The fight against formalities achieved its first real victory in Berlin in 1908. 
International copyright lawyers amended the Berne Convention in 1908, to require 
copyright terms of life plus fifty years, as well as the abolition of copyright 
formalities. The formalities were hated because the stories of inadvertent loss 
were increasingly common. It was as if a Charles Dickens character ran all 
copyright offices, and the failure to dot an i or cross a t resulted in the 
loss of widows’ only income.
These complaints were real and sensible. And the strictness of the formalities, 
especially in the United States, was absurd. The law should always have ways of 
forgiving innocent mistakes. There is no reason copyright law couldn’t, as well. 
Rather than abandoning formalities totally, the response in Berlin should have 
been to embrace a more equitable system of registration.
Even that would have been resisted, however, because registration in the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries was still expensive. It was also a hassle. 
The abolishment of formalities promised not only to save the starving widows, 
but also to lighten an unnecessary regulatory burden imposed upon creators.
In addition to the practical complaint of authors in 1908, there was a moral 
claim as well. There was no reason that creative property should be a second-
class form of property. If a carpenter builds a table, his rights over the table 
don’t depend upon filing a form with the government. He has a property right 
over the table naturally, and he can assert that right against anyone who 
would steal the table, whether or not he has informed the government of his 
ownership of the table.
This argument is correct, but its implications are misleading. For the argument 
in favor of formalities does not depend upon creative property being second-
class property. The argument in favor of formalities turns upon the special 
problems that creative property presents. The law of formalities responds to the 
special physics of creative property, to assure that it can be efficiently and 
fairly spread.
No one thinks, for example, that land is second-class property just because you 
have to register a deed with a court if your sale of land is to be effective. 
And few would think a car is second-class property just because you must 
register the car with the state and tag it with a license. In both of those 
cases, everyone sees that there is an important reason to secure registration
both because it makes the markets more efficient and because it better secures 
the rights of the owner. Without a registration system for land, landowners 
would perpetually have to guard their property. With registration, they can 
simply point the police to a deed. Without a registration system for cars, auto 
theft would be much easier. With a registration system, the thief has a high 
burden to sell a stolen car. A slight burden is placed on the property owner, 
but those burdens produce a much better system of protection for property 
generally.
It is similarly special physics that makes formalities important in copyright 
law. Unlike a carpenter’s table, there’s nothing in nature that makes it 
relatively obvious who might own a particular bit of creative property. A 
recording of Lyle Lovett’s latest album can exist in a billion places without 
anything necessarily linking it back to a particular owner. And like a car, 
there’s no way to buy and sell creative property with confidence unless there is 
some simple way to authenticate who is the author and what rights he has. Simple 
transactions are destroyed in a world without formalities. Complex, expensive, 
/lawyer transactions take their place.
This was the understanding of the problem with the Sonny Bono Act that we tried 
to demonstrate to the Court. This was the part it didn’t get. Because we live 
in a system without formalities, there is no way easily to build upon or use 
culture from our past. If copyright terms were, as Justice Story said they would 
be, short, then this wouldn’t matter much. For fourteen years, under the 
framers’ system, a work would be presumptively controlled. After fourteen years, 
it would be presumptively uncontrolled.
But now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the inability to know 
what is protected and what is not protected becomes a huge and obvious burden on 
the creative process. If the only way a library can offer an Internet exhibit 
about the New Deal is to hire a lawyer to clear the rights to every image and 
sound, then the copyright system is burdening creativity in a way that has never 
been seen before because there are no formalities.
The Eldred Act was designed to respond to exactly this problem. If it is worth 
$1 to you, then register your work and you can get the longer term. Others will 
know how to contact you and, therefore, how to get your permission if they want 
to use your work. And you will get the benefit of an extended copyright term.
If it isn’t worth it to you to register to get the benefit of an extended term, 
then it shouldn’t be worth it for the government to defend your monopoly over 
that work either. The work should pass into the public domain where anyone can 
copy it, or build archives with it, or create a movie based on it. It should 
become free if it is not worth $1 to you.
Some worry about the burden on authors. Won’t the burden of registering the work 
mean that the $1 is really misleading? Isn’t the hassle worth more than $1? 
Isn’t that the real problem with registration?
It is. The hassle is terrible. The system that exists now is awful. I completely 
agree that the Copyright Office has done a terrible job (no doubt because they 
are terribly funded) in enabling simple and cheap registrations. Any real 
solution to the problem of formalities must address the real problem of 
/governments standing at the core of any system of formalities. In this book, I 
offer such a solution. That solution essentially remakes the Copyright Office. 
For now, assume it was Amazon that ran the registration system. Assume it was 
one-click registration. The Eldred Act would propose a simple, one-click 
registration fifty years after a work was published. Based upon historical data, 
that system would move up to 98 percent of commercial work, commercial work that 
no longer had a commercial life, into the public domain within fifty years. What 
do you think?
When Steve Forbes endorsed the idea, some in Washington began to pay attention. 
Many people contacted me pointing to representatives who might be willing to 
introduce the Eldred Act. And I had a few who directly suggested that they might 
be willing to take the first step.
One representative, Zoe Lofgren of California, went so far as to get the bill 
drafted. The draft solved any problem with international law. It imposed the 
simplest requirement upon copyright owners possible. In May 2003, it looked as 
if the bill would be introduced. On May 16, I posted on the Eldred Act blog, we 
are close. There was a general reaction in the blog community that something 
good might happen here.
But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene. Jack Valenti and the MPAA 
general counsel came to the congresswoman’s office to give the view of the MPAA. 
Aided by his lawyer, as Valenti told me, Valenti informed the congresswoman that 
the MPAA would oppose the Eldred Act. The reasons are embarrassingly thin. More 
importantly, their thinness shows something clear about what this debate is 
really about.
The MPAA argued first that Congress had firmly rejected the central concept in 
the proposed billthat copyrights be renewed. That was true, but irrelevant, as 
Congress’s firm rejection had occurred long before the Internet made 
subsequent uses much more likely. Second, they argued that the proposal would 
harm poor copyright ownersapparently those who could not afford the $1 fee. 
Third, they argued that Congress had determined that extending a copyright term 
would encourage restoration work. Maybe in the case of the small percentage of 
work covered by copyright law that is still commercially valuable, but again 
this was irrelevant, as the proposal would not cut off the extended term unless 
the $1 fee was not paid. Fourth, the MPAA argued that the bill would impose 
enormous costs, since a registration system is not free. True enough, but 
those costs are certainly less than the costs of clearing the rights for a 
copyright whose owner is not known. Fifth, they worried about the risks if the 
copyright to a story underlying a film were to pass into the public domain. But 
what risk is that? If it is in the public domain, then the film is a valid 
derivative use.
Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright owners to do this 
if they wanted. But the whole point is that there are thousands of copyright 
owners who don’t even know they have a copyright to give. Whether they are free 
to give away their copyright or nota controversial claim in any caseunless 
they know about a copyright, they’re not likely to.
At the beginning of this book, I told two stories about the law reacting to 
changes in technology. In the one, common sense prevailed. In the other, common 
sense was delayed. The difference between the two stories was the power of the 
oppositionthe power of the side that fought to defend the status quo. In both 
cases, a new technology threatened old interests. But in only one case did those 
interest’s have the power to protect themselves against this new competitive 
threat.
I used these two cases as a way to frame the war that this book has been about. 
For here, too, a new technology is forcing the law to react. And here, too, we 
should ask, is the law following or resisting common sense? If common sense 
supports the law, what explains this common sense?
When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the copyright owners. 
The commercial piracy that I described is wrong and harmful, and the law should 
work to eliminate it. When the issue is p2p sharing, it is easy to understand 
why the law backs the owners still: Much of this sharing is wrong, even if much 
is harmless. When the issue is copyright terms for the Mickey Mouses of the 
world, it is possible still to understand why the law favors Hollywood: Most 
people don’t recognize the reasons for limiting copyright terms; it is thus 
still possible to see good faith within the resistance.
But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the Eldred Act, then, 
finally, there is an example that lays bare the naked self-interest driving this 
war. This act would free an extraordinary range of content that is otherwise 
unused. It wouldn’t interfere with any copyright owner’s desire to exercise 
continued control over his content. It would simply liberate what Kevin Kelly 
calls the Dark Content that fills archives around the world. So when the 
warriors oppose a change like this, we should ask one simple question:
What does this industry really want?
With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content. So the effort 
to block something like the Eldred Act is not really about protecting their 
content. The effort to block the Eldred Act is an effort to assure that nothing 
more passes into the public domain. It is another step to assure that the public 
domain will never compete, that there will be no use of content that is not 
commercially controlled, and that there will be no commercial use of content 
that doesn’t require their permission first.
The opposition to the Eldred Act reveals how extreme the other side is. The most 
powerful and sexy and well loved of lobbies really has as its aim not the 
protection of property but the rejection of a tradition. Their aim is not 
simply to protect what is theirs. Their aim is to assure that all there is is 
what is theirs.
It is not hard to understand why the warriors take this view. It is not hard to 
see why it would benefit them if the competition of the public domain tied to 
the Internet could somehow be quashed. Just as RCA feared the competition of FM, 
they fear the competition of a public domain connected to a public that now has 
the means to create with it and to share its own creation.
What is hard to understand is why the public takes this view. It is as if the 
law made airplanes trespassers. The MPAA stands with the Causbys and demands 
that their remote and useless property rights be respected, so that these remote 
and forgotten copyright holders might block the progress of others.
All this seems to follow easily from this untroubled acceptance of the 
property in intellectual property. Common sense supports it, and so long as it 
does, the assaults will rain down upon the technologies of the Internet. The 
consequence will be an increasing permission society. The past can be 
cultivated only if you can identify the owner and gain permission to build upon 
his work. The future will be controlled by this dead (and often unfindable) hand 
of the past.
