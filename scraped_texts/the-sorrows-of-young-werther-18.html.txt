What a child is man! We had been to Walheim: the ladies went in
a carriage; but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte’s

carriage again, young W. Seldstadt, Andran, and I were standing
about the door. They are a merry set of fellows, and they were
all laughing and joking together. I watched Charlotte’s eyes.
They wandered from one to the other; but they did not light on me,

The carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears. I looked
after her: suddenly I saw Charlotte’s bonnet leaning out of the
