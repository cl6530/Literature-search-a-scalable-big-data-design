ABASEMENT, n.  A decent and customary mental attitude in the presence 
of wealth of power.  Peculiarly appropriate in an employee when 
addressing an employer.
ABATIS, n.  Rubbish in front of a fort, to prevent the rubbish outside 
from molesting the rubbish inside.
ABDICATION, n.  An act whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the 
high temperature of the throne.
  Poor Isabella’s Dead, whose abdication
  Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation.
  For that performance ’twere unfair to scold her:
  She wisely left a throne too hot to hold her.
  To History she’ll be no royal riddle —
  Merely a plain parched pea that jumped the griddle.
G.J.

ABDOMEN, n.  The temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with 
sacrificial rights, all true men engage.  From women this ancient 
faith commands but a stammering assent.  They sometimes minister at 
the altar in a half-hearted and ineffective way, but true reverence 
for the one deity that men really adore they know not.  If woman had a 
free hand in the world’s marketing the race would become 
graminivorous.
ABILITY, n.  The natural equipment to accomplish some small part of 
the meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead ones.  In the 
last analysis ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high 
degree of solemnity.  Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is 
rightly appraised; it is no easy task to be solemn.
ABNORMAL, adj.  Not conforming to standard.  In matters of thought and 
conduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to be 
detested.  Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the 
straiter [sic] resemblance of the Average Man than he hath to himself.  
Whoso attaineth thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death and 
the hope of Hell.
ABORIGINIES, n.  Persons of little worth found cumbering the soil of a 
newly discovered country.  They soon cease to cumber; they fertilize.
ABRACADABRA.
  By Abracadabra we signify
      An infinite number of things.
  ’Tis the answer to What? and How? and Why?
  And Whence? and Whither? — a word whereby
      The Truth (with the comfort it brings)
  Is open to all who grope in night,
  Crying for Wisdom’s holy light.
  Whether the word is a verb or a noun
      Is knowledge beyond my reach.
  I only know that ’tis handed down.
          From sage to sage,
          From age to age —
      An immortal part of speech!
  Of an ancient man the tale is told
  That he lived to be ten centuries old,
      In a cave on a mountain side.
      (True, he finally died.)
  The fame of his wisdom filled the land,
  For his head was bald, and you’ll understand
      His beard was long and white
      And his eyes uncommonly bright.
  Philosophers gathered from far and near
  To sit at his feat and hear and hear,
          Though he never was heard
          To utter a word
      But “Abracadabra, abracadab,
          Abracada, abracad,
      Abraca, abrac, abra, ab!“
          ’Twas all he had,
  ’Twas all they wanted to hear, and each
  Made copious notes of the mystical speech,
          Which they published next —
          A trickle of text
  In the meadow of commentary.
      Mighty big books were these,
      In a number, as leaves of trees;
  In learning, remarkably — very!
          He’s dead,
          As I said,
  And the books of the sages have perished,
  But his wisdom is sacredly cherished.
  In Abracadabra it solemnly rings,
  Like an ancient bell that forever swings.
          O, I love to hear
          That word make clear
  Humanity’s General Sense of Things.
Jamrach Holobom

ABRIDGE, v.t.  To shorten.
      When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for 
  people to abridge their king, a decent respect for the opinions of 
  mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel 
  them to the separation.
Oliver Cromwell

ABRUPT, adj.  Sudden, without ceremony, like the arrival of a cannon- 
shot and the departure of the soldier whose interests are most 
affected by it.  Dr. Samuel Johnson beautifully said of another 
author’s ideas that they were “concatenated without abruption.”
ABSCOND, v.i.  To “move in a mysterious way,” commonly with the 
property of another.
  Spring beckons!  All things to the call respond;
  The trees are leaving and cashiers abscond.
Phela Orm

ABSENT, adj.  Peculiarly exposed to the tooth of detraction; vilifed; 
hopelessly in the wrong; superseded in the consideration and affection 
of another.
  To men a man is but a mind.  Who cares
  What face he carries or what form he wears?
  But woman’s body is the woman.  O,
  Stay thou, my sweetheart, and do never go,
  But heed the warning words the sage hath said:
  A woman absent is a woman dead.
Jogo Tyree

ABSENTEE, n.  A person with an income who has had the forethought to 
remove himself from the sphere of exaction.
ABSOLUTE, adj.  Independent, irresponsible.  An absolute monarchy is 
one in which the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he pleases 
the assassins.  Not many absolute monarchies are left, most of them 
having been replaced by limited monarchies, where the sovereign’s 
power for evil (and for good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, 
which are governed by chance.
ABSTAINER, n.  A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying 
himself a pleasure.  A total abstainer is one who abstains from 
everything but abstention, and especially from inactivity in the 
affairs of others.
  Said a man to a crapulent youth:  “I thought
      You a total abstainer, my son."
  “So I am, so I am,” said the scrapgrace caught —
      “But not, sir, a bigoted one.”
G.J.

having offered them a fee for assenting.
ACCORD, n.  Harmony.
ACCORDION, n.  An instrument in harmony with the sentiments of an 
assassin.
ACCOUNTABILITY, n.  The mother of caution.

      Of ability you possess.”
Joram Tate

  To know that’s what you would have done.”

  Have reverently crossed my hands and slept.
Junker Barlow

ALLIGATOR, n.  The crocodile of America, superior in every detail to 
the crocodile of the effete monarchies of the Old World.  Herodotus 
says the Indus is, with one exception, the only river that produces 
crocodiles, but they appear to have gone West and grown up with the 
other rivers.  From the notches on his back the alligator is called a 
sawrian.
ALONE, adj.  In bad company.
  In contact, lo! the flint and steel,
  By spark and flame, the thought reveal
  That he the metal, she the stone,
  Had cherished secretly alone.

ALTAR, n.  The place whereupon the priest formerly raveled out the 
small intestine of the sacrificial victim for purposes of divination 
and cooked its flesh for the gods.  The word is now seldom used, 
except with reference to the sacrifice of their liberty and peace by a 
male and a female tool.
  They stood before the altar and supplied
  The fire themselves in which their fat was fried.

  An offering burnt with an unholy flame.

it greatly affects in turn.
  “Eat arsenic?  Yes, all you get,"
      Consenting, he did speak up;
  “’Tis better you should eat it, pet,
      Than put it in my teacup.”
Joel Huck

ART, n.  This word has no definition.  Its origin is related as 
follows by the ingenious Father Gassalasca Jape, S.J.
  One day a wag — what would the wretch be at? —
  Shifted a letter of the cipher RAT,
  And said it was a god’s name!  Straight arose
  Fantastic priests and postulants (with shows,
  And mysteries, and mummeries, and hymns,
  And disputations dire that lamed their limbs)
  To serve his temple and maintain the fires,
  Expound the law, manipulate the wires.
  Amazed, the populace that rites attend,
  Believe whate’er they cannot comprehend,
  And, inly edified to learn that two
  Half-hairs joined so and so (as Art can do)
  Have sweeter values and a grace more fit
  Than Nature’s hairs that never have been split,
  Bring cates and wines for sacrificial feasts,
  And sell their garments to support the priests.
ARTLESSNESS, n.  A certain engaging quality to which women attain by 
long study and severe practice upon the admiring male, who is pleased 
to fancy it resembles the candid simplicity of his young.
ASPERSE, v.t.  Maliciously to ascribe to another vicious actions which 
one has not had the temptation and opportunity to commit.
ASS, n.  A public singer with a good voice but no ear.  In Virginia 
City, Nevada, he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator, 
and everywhere the Donkey.  The animal is widely and variously 
celebrated in the literature, art and religion of every age and 
country; no other so engages and fires the human imagination as this 
noble vertebrate.  Indeed, it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, lib. 
II., De Clem., and C. Stantatus, De Temperamente) if it is not a 
god; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we 
may believe Macrobious, by the Cupasians also.  Of the only two 
animals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of 
men, the ass that carried Balaam is one, the dog of the Seven Sleepers 
the other.  This is no small distinction.  From what has been written 
about this beast might be compiled a library of great splendor and 
magnitude, rivalling that of the Shakespearean cult, and that which 
clusters about the Bible.  It may be said, generally, that all 
literature is more or less Asinine.
  “Hail, holy Ass!” the quiring angels sing;
  “Priest of Unreason, and of Discords King!"
  Great co-Creator, let Thy glory shine:
  God made all else, the Mule, the Mule is thine!”
G.J.

AUCTIONEER, n.  The man who proclaims with a hammer that he has picked 
a pocket with his tongue.
AUSTRALIA, n.  A country lying in the South Sea, whose industrial and 
commercial development has been unspeakably retarded by an unfortunate 
dispute among geographers as to whether it is a continent or an 
island.
AVERNUS, n.  The lake by which the ancients entered the infernal 
regions.  The fact that access to the infernal regions was obtained by 
a lake is believed by the learned Marcus Ansello Scrutator to have 
suggested the Christian rite of baptism by immersion.  This, however, 
has been shown by Lactantius to be an error.
  Facilis descensus Averni,
      The poet remarks; and the sense
  Of it is that when down-hill I turn I
      Will get more of punches than pence.
