Who says that English folk have no fairy-tales of their own? The
present volume contains only a selection out of some 140, of which I
have found traces in this country. It is probable that many more
exist.
A quarter of the tales in this volume, have been collected during the
last ten years or so, and some of them have not been hitherto
published. Up to 1870 it was equally said of France and of Italy, that
they possessed no folk-tales. Yet, within fifteen years from that
date, over 1000 tales had been collected in each country. I am hoping
that the present volume may lead to equal activity in this country,
and would earnestly beg any reader of this book who knows of similar
tales, to communicate them, written down as they are told, to me, care
of Mr. Nutt. The only reason, I imagine, why such tales have not
hitherto been brought to light, is the lamentable gap between the
governing and recording classes and the dumb working classes of this
country–dumb to others but eloquent among themselves. It would be no
unpatriotic task to help to bridge over this gulf, by giving a common
fund of nursery literature to all classes of the English people, and,
in any case, it can do no harm to add to the innocent gaiety of the
nation.
A word or two as to our title seems necessary. We have called our
stories Fairy Tales though few of them speak of fairies. [Footnote:
For some recent views on fairies and tales about fairies, see
Notes.] The same remark applies to the collection of the Brothers
Grimm and to all the other European collections, which contain exactly
the same classes of tales as ours. Yet our stories are what the little
ones mean when they clamour for “Fairy Tales,” and this is the only
name which they give to them. One cannot imagine a child saying, “Tell
us a folk-tale, nurse,” or “Another nursery tale, please, grandma.” As
our book is intended for the little ones, we have indicated its
contents by the name they use. The words “Fairy Tales” must
accordingly be taken to include tales in which occurs something
“fairy,” something extraordinary–fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking
animals. It must be taken also to cover tales in which what is
extraordinary is the stupidity of some of the actors. Many of the
tales in this volume, as in similar collections for other European
countries, are what the folklorists call Drolls. They serve to justify
the title of Merrie England, which used to be given to this country of
ours, and indicate unsuspected capacity for fun and humour among the
unlettered classes. The story of Tom Tit Tot, which opens our
collection, is unequalled among all other folk-tales I am acquainted
with, for its combined sense of humour and dramatic power.
The first adjective of our title also needs a similar extension of its
meaning. I have acted on Molière’s principle, and have taken what was
good wherever I could find it. Thus, a couple of these stories have
been found among descendants of English immigrants in America; a
couple of others I tell as I heard them myself in my youth in
Australia. One of the best was taken down from the mouth of an English
Gipsy. I have also included some stories that have only been found in
Lowland Scotch. I have felt justified in doing this, as of the twenty-
one folk-tales contained in Chambers’ “Popular Rhymes of Scotland,” no
less than sixteen are also to be found in an English form. With the
Folk-tale as with the Ballad, Lowland Scotch may be regarded as simply
a dialect of English, and it is a mere chance whether a tale is extant
in one or other, or both.
I have also rescued and re-told a few Fairy Tales that only exist now-
a-days in the form of ballads. There are certain indications that the
“common form” of the English Fairy Tale was the cante-fable, a
mixture of narrative and verse of which the most illustrious example
in literature is “Aucassin et Nicolette.” In one case I have
endeavoured to retain this form, as the tale in which it occurs,
“Childe Rowland,” is mentioned by Shakespeare in King Lear, and
is probably, as I have shown, the source of Milton’s Comus.
Late as they have been collected, some dozen of the tales can be
traced back to the sixteenth century, two of them being quoted by
Shakespeare himself.
In the majority of instances I have had largely to rewrite these Fairy
Tales, especially those in dialect, including the Lowland Scotch.
[Footnote: It is perhaps worth remarking that the Brothers Grimm did
the same with their stories. “Dass der Ausdruck,” say they in their
Preface, “und die Ausführung des Einzelnen grossentheils von uns
herrührt, versteht sich von selbst.” I may add that many of their
stories were taken from printed sources. In the first volume of Mrs.
Hunt’s translation, Nos. 12, 18, 19, 23, 32, 35, 42, 43, 44, 69, 77,
78, 83, 89, are thus derived.] Children, and sometimes those of larger
growth, will not read dialect. I have also had to reduce the flatulent
phraseology of the eighteenth-century chap-books, and to re-write in
simpler style the stories only extant in “Literary” English. I have,
however, left a few vulgarisms in the mouths of vulgar people.
Children appreciate the dramatic propriety of this as much as their
elders. Generally speaking, it has been my ambition to write as a good
old nurse will speak when she tells Fairy Tales. I am doubtful as to
my success in catching the colloquial-romantic tone appropriate for
such narratives, but the thing had to be done or else my main object,
to give a book of English Fairy Tales which English children will
listen to, would have been unachieved. This book is meant to be read
aloud, and not merely taken in by the eye.
In a few instances I have introduced or changed an incident. I have
never done so, however, without mentioning the fact in the Notes.
These have been relegated to the obscurity of small print and a back
place, while the little ones have been, perhaps unnecessarily, warned
off them. They indicate my sources and give a few references to
parallels and variants which may be of interest to fellow-students of
Folk-lore. It is, perhaps, not necessary to inform readers who are not
fellow-students that the study of Folk-tales has pretensions to be a
science. It has its special terminology, and its own methods of
investigation, by which it is hoped, one of these days, to gain fuller
knowledge of the workings of the popular mind as well as traces of
archaic modes of thought and custom. I hope on some future occasion to
treat the subject of the English Folk-tale on a larger scale and with
all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus. I shall
then, of course, reproduce my originals with literal accuracy, and
have therefore felt the more at liberty on the present occasion to
make the necessary deviations from this in order to make the tales
readable for children.
Finally, I have to thank those by whose kindness in waiving their
rights to some of these stories, I have been enabled to compile this
book. My friends Mr. E. Clodd, Mr. F. Hindes Groome, and Mr. Andrew
Lang, have thus yielded up to me some of the most attractive stories
in the following pages. The Councils of the English and of the
American Folk-lore Societies, and Messrs. Longmans, have also been
equally generous. Nor can I close these remarks without a word of
thanks and praise to the artistic skill with which my friend, Mr. J.
D. Batten, has made the romance and humour of these stories live again
in the brilliant designs with which he has adorned these pages. It
should be added that the dainty headpieces to “Henny Penny” and “Mr.
Fox” are due to my old friend, Mr. Henry Ryland.
