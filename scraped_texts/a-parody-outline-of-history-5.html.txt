This story occurs under the blue skies and bluer laws of Puritan
New England, in the days when religion was still taken seriously
by a great many people, and in the town of Plymouth where the
“Mayflower”, having ploughed its platitudinous way from Holland,
had landed its precious cargo of pious Right Thinkers, moral
Gentlemen of God, and—Priscilla.
Priscilla was—well, Priscilla had yellow hair.  In a later
generation, in a 1921 June, if she had toddled by at a country
club dance you would have noticed first of all that glorious mass
of bobbed corn-colored locks. You would, then, perhaps, have
glanced idly at her face, and suddenly said “Oh my gosh!”  The
next moment you would have clutched the nearest stag and hissed,
“Quick—yellow hair—silver dress—oh Judas!”  You would then
have been introduced, and after dancing nine feet you would have
been cut in on by another panting stag.  In those nine delirious
feet you would have become completely dazed by one of the
smoothest lines since the building of the Southern Pacific.  You
would then have borrowed somebody’s flask, gone into the locker
room and gotten an edge—not a bachelor-dinner edge but just
enough to give you the proper amount of confidence. You would
have returned to the ballroom, cut in on this twentieth century
Priscilla, and taken her and your edge out to a convenient
limousine, or the first tee.
It was of some such yellow-haired Priscilla that Homer dreamed
when he smote his lyre and chanted, “I sing of arms and the man";
it was at the sight of such as she that rare Ben Johnson’s Dr.
Faustus cried, “Was this the face that launched a thousand
ships?” In all ages has such beauty enchanted the minds of men,
calling forth in one century the Fiesolian terza rima of
“Paradise Lost”, in another the passionate arias of a dozen
Beethoven symphonies. In 1620 the pagan daughter of Helen of Troy
and Cleopatra of the Nile happened, by a characteristic jest of
the great Ironist, to embark with her aunt on the
“Mayflower”.
Like all girls of eighteen Priscilla had learned to kiss and be
kissed on every possible occasion; in the exotic and not at all
uncommon pleasure of “petting” she had acquired infinite wisdom
and complete disillusionment. But in all her “petting parties” on
the “Mayflower” and in Plymouth she had found no Puritan who held
her interest beyond the first kiss, and she had lately reverted
in sheer boredom to her boarding school habit of drinking gin in
large quantities, a habit which was not entirely approved of by
her old-fashioned aunt, although Mrs. Brewster was glad to have
her niece stay at home in the evenings “instead”, as she told
Mrs. Bradford, “of running around with those boys, and really, my
dear, Priscilla says some of the FUNNIEST things when she gets a
little er—’boiled’, as she calls it—you must come over some
evening, and bring the governor.”
Mrs. Brewster, Priscilla’s aunt, is the ancestor of all New
England aunts. She may be seen today walking down Tremont Street,
Boston, in her Educator shoes on her way to S. S. Pierce’s which
she pronounces to rhyme with HEARSE.  The twentieth century Mrs.
Brewster wears a highnecked black silk waist with a chatelaine
watch pinned over her left breast and a spot of Gordon’s codfish
(no bones) over her right. When a little girl she was taken to
see Longfellow, Lowell, and Ralph Waldo Emerson; she speaks
familiarly of the James boys, but this has no reference to the
well-known Missouri outlaws. She was brought up on blueberry
cake, Postum and “The Atlantic Monthly"; she loves the Boston
“Transcript”, God, and her relatives in Newton Centre.  Her idea
of a daring joke is the remark Susan Hale made to Edward Everett
Hale about sending underwear to the heathen. She once asked
Donald Ogden Stewart to dinner with her niece; she didn’t think
his story about the lady mind reader who read the man’s mind and
then slapped his face, was very funny; she never asked him again.
The action of this story all takes place in MRS.  BREWSTER’S
Plymouth home on two successive June evenings.  As the figurative
curtain rises MRS.  BREWSTER is sitting at a desk reading the
latest instalment of Foxe’s “Book of Martyrs”.
The sound of a clanking sword is heard outside.  MRS.  BREWSTER
looks up, smiles to herself, and goes on reading.  A knock—a
timid knock.
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Come in.
(Enter CAPTAIN MIKES STANDISH, whiskered and forty. In a later
generation, with that imposing mustache and his hatred of
Indians, Miles would undoubtedly have been a bank president. At
present he seems somewhat ill at ease, and obviously relieved to
find only PRISCILLA’S aunt at home.)
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Good evening, Captain Standish.
MILES:  Good evening, Mrs. Brewster.  It’s—it’s cool for June,
isn’t it?
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Yes.  I suppose we’ll pay, for it with a hot
July, though.
MILES (nervously): Yes, but it—it is cool for June, isn’t it?
MRS.  BREWSTER:  So you said, Captain.
MILES:  Yes.  So I said, didn’t I?  (Silence.)
MILES:  Mistress Priscilla isn’t home, then?
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Why, I don’t think so, Captain But I never can
be sure where Priscilla is.
MILES (eagerly): She’s a—a fine girl, isn’t she? A fine girl.
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Why, yes.  Of course, Priscilla has her faults
but she’d make some man a fine wife—some man who knew how to
handle her— an older man, with experience.
MILES:  Do you really think so, Mrs. Brewster?  (After a minute.)
Do you think Priscilla is thinking about marrying anybody in
particular?
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Well, I can’t say, Captain.  You know—she’s a
little wild. Her mother was wild, too, you know—that is, before
the Lord spoke to her. They say she used to be seen at the
Mermaid Tavern in London with all those play-acting people.  She
always used to say that Priscilla would marry a military man.
MILES:  A military man?  Well, now tell me Mrs. Brewster, do you
think that a sweet delicate creature like Priscilla—
A VOICE (in the next room): Oh DAMN!
MRS.  BREWSTER:  That must be Priscilla now.
THE VOICE:  Auntie!
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Yes, Priscilla dear.
THE VOICE:  Where in hell did you put the vermouth?
MRS.  BREWSTER:  In the cupboard, dear.  I do hope you aren’t
going to get—er—"boiled” again tonight, Priscilla.  (Enter
PRISCILLA, infinitely radiant, infinitely beautiful, with a
bottle of vermouth in one hand and a jug of gin in the other.)
PRISCILLA:  Auntie, that was a dirty trick to hide the vermouth. 
Hello Miles—shoot many Indians today?
MILES:  Why—er er—no, Mistress Priscilla.
PRISCILLA:  Wish you’d take me with you next time, Miles.  I’d
love to shoot an Indian, wouldn’t you, auntie?
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Priscilla!  What an idea!  And please dear, give
Auntie Brewster the gin.  I—er—promised to take some to the
church social tonight and it’s almost all gone now.
MILES:  I didn’t see you at church last night, Mistress
Priscilla.
PRISCILLA:  Well I’ll tell you, Miles.  I started to go to
church— really felt awfully religious.  But just as I was
leaving I thought, “Priscilla, how about a drink—just one little
drink?”  You know, Miles, church goes so much better when you’re
just a little boiled— the lights and everything just kind
of—oh, its glorious. Well last night, after I’d had a little
liquor, the funniest thing happened.  I felt awfully good, not
like church at all— so I just thought I’d take a walk in the
woods.  And I came to a pool—a wonderful honest-to-God
pool—with the moon shining right into the middle of it.  So I
just undressed and dove in and it was the most marvelous thing in
the world. And then I danced on the bank in the grass and the
moonlight— oh, Lordy, Miles, you ought to have seen me.
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Priscilla!
PRISCILLA:  ’Scuse me, Auntie Brewster.  And then I just lay in
the grass and sang and laughed.
MRS.  BREWSTER:  Dear, you’ll catch your death of cold one of
these nights.  I hope you’ll excuse me, Captain Standish; it’s
time I was going to our social.  I’ll leave Priscilla to
entertain you.  Now be a good girl, Priscilla, and please dear
don’t drink straight vermouth—remember what happened last time.
Good night, Captain—good night, dear.
(Exit MRS.  BREWSTER with gin.)
PRISCILLA:  Oh damn!  What’ll we do, Miles—I’m getting awfully
sleepy.
MILES:  Why—we might—er—pet a bit.
PRISCILLA (yawning): No. I’m too tired—besides, I hate whiskers.
MILES:  Yes, that’s so, I remember.  (Ten minutes’ silence, with
MILES looking sentimentally into the fireplace, PRISCILLA curled
up in a chair on the other side.)
MILES:  I was—your aunt and I—we were talking about you before
you came in. It was a talk that meant a lot to me.
PRISCILLA:  Miles, would you mind closing that window?
(MILES closes the window and returns to his chair by the
fireplace.)
MILES:  And your aunt told me that your mother said you would
some day marry a military man.
PRISCILLA:  Miles, would you mind passing me that pillow over
there?
(MILES gets up, takes the pillow to PRISCILLA and again sits
down.
MILES:  And I thought that if you wanted a military man why—
well, I’ve always thought a great deal of you, Mistress
Priscilla— and since my Rose died I’ve been pretty lonely, and
while I’m nothing but a rough old soldier yet—well, what I’m
driving at is— you see, maybe you and I could sort of—well, I’m
not much of a hand at fancy love speeches and all that—but
(He is interrupted by a snore.  He glances up and sees that
PRISCILLA has fallen fast asleep.  He sits looking hopelessly
into the fireplace for a long time, then gets up, puts on his hat
and tiptoes out of the door.) 
THE NEXT EVENING
PRISCILLA is sitting alone, lost in revery, before the fireplace.
It is almost as if she had not moved since the evening before.
A knock, and the door opens to admit JOHN ALDEN, nonchalant,
disillusioned, and twenty-one.
JOHN:  Good evening.  Hope I don’t bother you.
PRISCILLA:  The only people who bother me are women who tell me
I’m beautiful and men who don’t.
JOHN:  Not a very brilliant epigram—but still—yes, you ARE
beautiful.
PRISCILLA:  Of course, if it’s an effort for you to say—
JOHN:  Nothing is worthwhile without effort.
PRISCILLA:  Sounds like Miles Standish; many things I do without
effort are worthwhile; I am beautiful without the slightest
effort.
JOHN:  Yes, you’re right.  I could kiss you without any effort—
and that would be worthwhile—perhaps.
PRISCILLA:  Kissing me would prove nothing.  I kiss as casually
as I breathe.
JOHN:  And if you didn’t breathe—or kiss—you would die.
PRISCILLA:  Any woman would.
JOHN:  Then you are like other women.  How
unfortunate.
PRISCILLA:  I am like no woman you ever knew.
JOHN:  You arouse my curiosity.
PRISCILLA:  Curiosity killed a cat.
JOHN:  A cat may look at a—Queen.
PRISCILLA:  And a Queen keeps cats for her amusement. They purr
so delightfully when she pets them.
JOHN:  I never learned to purr; it must be amusing—for the
Queen.
PRISCILLA:  Let me teach you.  I’m starting a new class tonight.
JOHN:  I’m afraid I couldn’t afford to pay the tuition.
PRISCILLA:  For a few exceptionally meritorious pupils, various
scholarships and fellowships have been provided.
JOHN:  By whom?  Old graduates?
PRISCILLA:  NO—the institution has been endowed by God—
JOHN:  With exceptional beauty—I’m afraid I’m going to kiss you. 
NOW.
(They kiss.)
(Ten minutes pass.)
PRISCILLA:  Stop smiling in that inane way.
JOHN:  I just happened to think of something awfully funny. You
know the reason why I came over here tonight?
PRISCILLA:  To see me.  I wondered why you hadn’t come months
ago.
JOHN:  No. It’s really awfully funny—but I came here tonight
because Miles Standish made me promise this morning to ask you to
marry him. Miles is an awfully good egg, really
Priscilla.
PRISCILLA:  Speak for yourself, John.  (They kiss.)
PRISCILLA:  Again.
JOHN:  Again—and again.  Oh Lord, I’m gone.
(An hour later JOHN leaves.  As the door closes behind him
PRISCILLA sinks back into her chair before the fireplace; an hour
passes, and she does not move; her aunt returns from the
Bradfords’ and after a few ineffectual attempts at conversation
goes to bed alone; the candles gutter, flicker, and die out; the
room is filled of sacred silence.  Once more the clock chimes
forth the hour—the hour of fluted peace, of dead desire and epic
love.  Oh not for aye, Endymion, mayst thou unfold the purple
panoply of priceless years. She sleeps—PRISCILLA sleeps—and
down the palimpsest of age-old passion the lyres of night breathe
forth their poignant praise. She sleeps—eternal Helen—in the
moonlight of a thousand years; immortal symbol of immortal aeons,
flower of the gods transplanted on a foreign shore, infinitely
rare, infinitely erotic.[1])

Palace,” “Head and Shoulders,” “Bernice Bobs Her Hair,"
