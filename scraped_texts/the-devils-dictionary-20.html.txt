SABBATH, n.  A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God 
made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh.  Among the 
Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this 
is the Christian version:  “Remember the seventh day to make thy 
neighbor keep it wholly.”  To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient 
that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week, but the Early 
Fathers of the Church held other views.  So great is the sanctity of 
the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious 
jurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is 
reverently recognized, as is manifest in the following deep-water 
version of the Fourth Commandment:
  Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,
  And on the seventh holystone the deck and scrape the cable.
  Decks are no longer holystoned, but the cable still supplies the 
captain with opportunity to attest a pious respect for the divine 
ordinance.
SACERDOTALIST, n.  One who holds the belief that a clergyman is a 
priest.  Denial of this momentous doctrine is the hardest challenge 
that is now flung into the teeth of the Episcopalian church by the 
Neo-Dictionarians.
SACRAMENT, n.  A solemn religious ceremony to which several degrees of 
authority and significance are attached.  Rome has seven sacraments, 
but the Protestant churches, being less prosperous, feel that they can 
afford only two, and these of inferior sanctity.  Some of the smaller 
sects have no sacraments at all — for which mean economy they will 
indubitable be damned.
SACRED, adj.  Dedicated to some religious purpose; having a divine 
character; inspiring solemn thoughts or emotions; as, the Dalai Lama 
of Thibet; the Moogum of M’bwango; the temple of Apes in Ceylon; the 
Cow in India; the Crocodile, the Cat and the Onion of ancient Egypt; 
the Mufti of Moosh; the hair of the dog that bit Noah, etc.
  All things are either sacred or profane.
  The former to ecclesiasts bring gain;
  The latter to the devil appertain.

SANDLOTTER, n.  A vertebrate mammal holding the political views of 
Denis Kearney, a notorious demagogue of San Francisco, whose audiences 
gathered in the open spaces (sandlots) of the town.  True to the 
traditions of his species, this leader of the proletariat was finally 
bought off by his law-and-order enemies, living prosperously silent 
and dying impenitently rich.  But before his treason he imposed upon 
California a constitution that was a confection of sin in a diction of 
solecisms.  The similarity between the words “sandlotter” and 
“sansculotte” is problematically significant, but indubitably 
suggestive.
SAFETY-CLUTCH, n.  A mechanical device acting automatically to prevent 
the fall of an elevator, or cage, in case of an accident to the 
hoisting apparatus.
  Once I seen a human ruin
      In an elevator-well,
  And his members was bestrewin’
      All the place where he had fell.
  And I says, apostrophisin’
      That uncommon woful wreck:
  “Your position’s so surprisin’
      That I tremble for your neck!”
  Then that ruin, smilin’ sadly
      And impressive, up and spoke:
  “Well, I wouldn’t tremble badly,
      For it’s been a fortnight broke.”
  Then, for further comprehension
      Of his attitude, he begs
  I will focus my attention
      On his various arms and legs —
  How they all are contumacious;
      Where they each, respective, lie;
  How one trotter proves ungracious,
      T’other one an alibi.
  These particulars is mentioned
      For to show his dismal state,
  Which I wasn’t first intentioned
      To specifical relate.
  None is worser to be dreaded
      That I ever have heard tell
  Than the gent’s who there was spreaded
      In that elevator-well.
  Now this tale is allegoric —
      It is figurative all,
  For the well is metaphoric
      And the feller didn’t fall.
  I opine it isn’t moral
      For a writer-man to cheat,
  And despise to wear a laurel
      As was gotten by deceit.
  For ’tis Politics intended
      By the elevator, mind,
  It will boost a person splendid
      If his talent is the kind.
  Col. Bryan had the talent
      (For the busted man is him)
  And it shot him up right gallant
      Till his head begun to swim.
  Then the rope it broke above him
      And he painful come to earth
  Where there’s nobody to love him
      For his detrimented worth.
  Though he’s livin’ none would know him,
      Or at leastwise not as such.
  Moral of this woful poem:
      Frequent oil your safety-clutch.

SAINT, n.  A dead sinner revised and edited.
  The Duchess of Orleans relates that the irreverent old 
calumniator, Marshal Villeroi, who in his youth had known St. Francis 
de Sales, said, on hearing him called saint:  “I am delighted to hear 
that Monsieur de Sales is a saint.  He was fond of saying indelicate 
things, and used to cheat at cards.  In other respects he was a 
perfect gentleman, though a fool.”
SALACITY, n.  A certain literary quality frequently observed in 
popular novels, especially in those written by women and young girls, 
who give it another name and think that in introducing it they are 
occupying a neglected field of letters and reaping an overlooked 
harvest.  If they have the misfortune to live long enough they are 
tormented with a desire to burn their sheaves.
SALAMANDER, n.  Originally a reptile inhabiting fire; later, an 
anthropomorphous immortal, but still a pyrophile.  Salamanders are now 
believed to be extinct, the last one of which we have an account 
having been seen in Carcassonne by the Abbe Belloc, who exorcised it 
with a bucket of holy water.
SARCOPHAGUS, n.  Among the Greeks a coffin which being made of a 
certain kind of carnivorous stone, had the peculiar property of 
devouring the body placed in it.  The sarcophagus known to modern 
obsequiographers is commonly a product of the carpenter’s art.
SATAN, n.  One of the Creator’s lamentable mistakes, repented in 
sashcloth and axes.  Being instated as an archangel, Satan made 
himself multifariously objectionable and was finally expelled from 
Heaven.  Halfway in his descent he paused, bent his head in thought a 
moment and at last went back.  “There is one favor that I should like 
to ask,” said he.
  “Name it."
  “Man, I understand, is about to be created.  He will need laws."
  “What, wretch! you his appointed adversary, charged from the dawn 
of eternity with hatred of his soul — you ask for the right to make 
his laws?"
  “Pardon; what I have to ask is that he be permitted to make them 
himself."
  It was so ordered.
SATIETY, n.  The feeling that one has for the plate after he has eaten 
its contents, madam.
SATIRE, n.  An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the 
vices and follies of the author’s enemies were expounded with 
imperfect tenderness.  In this country satire never had more than a 
sickly and uncertain existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we 
are dolefully deficient, the humor that we mistake for it, like all 
humor, being tolerant and sympathetic.  Moreover, although Americans 
are “endowed by their Creator” with abundant vice and folly, it is not 
generally known that these are reprehensible qualities, wherefore the 
satirist is popularly regarded as a soul-spirited knave, and his ever 
victim’s outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent.
  Hail Satire! be thy praises ever sung
  In the dead language of a mummy’s tongue,
  For thou thyself art dead, and damned as well —
  Thy spirit (usefully employed) in Hell.
  Had it been such as consecrates the Bible
  Thou hadst not perished by the law of libel.
Barney Stims

SATYR, n.  One of the few characters of the Grecian mythology accorded 
recognition in the Hebrew.  (Leviticus, xvii, 7.)  The satyr was at 
first a member of the dissolute community acknowledging a loose 
allegiance with Dionysius, but underwent many transformations and 
improvements.  Not infrequently he is confounded with the faun, a 
later and decenter creation of the Romans, who was less like a man and 
more like a goat.
SAUCE, n.  The one infallible sign of civilization and enlightenment.  
A people with no sauces has one thousand vices; a people with one 
sauce has only nine hundred and ninety-nine.  For every sauce invented 
and accepted a vice is renounced and forgiven.
SAW, n.  A trite popular saying, or proverb.  (Figurative and 
colloquial.)  So called because it makes its way into a wooden head.  
Following are examples of old saws fitted with new teeth.
      A penny saved is a penny to squander.
      A man is known by the company that he organizes.
      A bad workman quarrels with the man who calls him that.
      A bird in the hand is worth what it will bring.
      Better late than before anybody has invited you.
      Example is better than following it.
      Half a loaf is better than a whole one if there is much else.
      Think twice before you speak to a friend in need.
      What is worth doing is worth the trouble of asking somebody to do it.
      Least said is soonest disavowed.
      He laughs best who laughs least.
      Speak of the Devil and he will hear about it.
      Of two evils choose to be the least.
      Strike while your employer has a big contract.
      Where there’s a will there’s a won’t.
SCARABAEUS, n.  The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians, allied to 
our familiar “tumble-bug.”  It was supposed to symbolize immortality, 
the fact that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity.  Its habit 
of incubating its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it 
to the favor of the priesthood, and may some day assure it an equal 
reverence among ourselves.  True, the American beetle is an inferior 
beetle, but the American priest is an inferior priest.
SCARABEE, n.  The same as scarabaeus.
              He fell by his own hand
                  Beneath the great oak tree.
              He’d traveled in a foreign land.
              He tried to make her understand
              The dance that’s called the Saraband,
                  But he called it Scarabee.
  He had called it so through an afternoon,
      And she, the light of his harem if so might be,
      Had smiled and said naught.  O the body was fair to see,
  All frosted there in the shine o’ the moon —
                      Dead for a Scarabee
  And a recollection that came too late.
                          O Fate!
                  They buried him where he lay,
                  He sleeps awaiting the Day,
                          In state,
  And two Possible Puns, moon-eyed and wan,
  Gloom over the grave and then move on.
                      Dead for a Scarabee!
                                                     Fernando Tapple
SCARIFICATION, n.  A form of penance practised by the mediaeval pious.  
The rite was performed, sometimes with a knife, sometimes with a hot 
iron, but always, says Arsenius Asceticus, acceptably if the penitent 
spared himself no pain nor harmless disfigurement.  Scarification, 
with other crude penances, has now been superseded by benefaction.  
The founding of a library or endowment of a university is said to 
yield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is 
conferred by the knife or iron, and is therefore a surer means of 
grace.  There are, however, two grave objections to it as a 
penitential method:  the good that it does and the taint of justice.
SCEPTER, n.  A king’s staff of office, the sign and symbol of his 
authority.  It was originally a mace with which the sovereign 
admonished his jester and vetoed ministerial measures by breaking the 
bones of their proponents.
SCIMETAR, n.  A curved sword of exceeding keenness, in the conduct of 
which certain Orientals attain a surprising proficiency, as the 
incident here related will serve to show.  The account is translated 
from the Japanese by Shusi Itama, a famous writer of the thirteenth 
century.
      When the great Gichi-Kuktai was Mikado he condemned to 
  decapitation Jijiji Ri, a high officer of the Court.  Soon after 
  the hour appointed for performance of the rite what was his 
  Majesty’s surprise to see calmly approaching the throne the man 
  who should have been at that time ten minutes dead!
      “Seventeen hundred impossible dragons!” shouted the enraged 
  monarch.  “Did I not sentence you to stand in the market-place and 
  have your head struck off by the public executioner at three 
  o’clock?  And is it not now 3:10?"
      “Son of a thousand illustrious deities,” answered the 
  condemned minister, “all that you say is so true that the truth is 
  a lie in comparison.  But your heavenly Majesty’s sunny and 
  vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded.  With joy I 
  ran and placed my unworthy body in the market-place.  The 
  executioner appeared with his bare scimetar, ostentatiously 
  whirled it in air, and then, tapping me lightly upon the neck, 
  strode away, pelted by the populace, with whom I was ever a 
  favorite.  I am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable 
  and treasonous head."
      “To what regiment of executioners does the black-boweled
  caitiff belong?” asked the Mikado.
      “To the gallant Ninety-eight Hundred and Thirty-seventh — I 
  know the man.  His name is Sakko-Samshi."
      “Let him be brought before me,” said the Mikado to an 
  attendant, and a half-hour later the culprit stood in the 
  Presence.
      “Thou bastard son of a three-legged hunchback without thumbs!” 
  roared the sovereign — “why didst thou but lightly tap the neck 
  that it should have been thy pleasure to sever?"
      “Lord of Cranes of Cherry Blooms,” replied the executioner, 
  unmoved, “command him to blow his nose with his fingers."
      Being commanded, Jijiji Ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted 
  like an elephant, all expecting to see the severed head flung 
  violently from him.  Nothing occurred:  the performance prospered 
  peacefully to the close, without incident.
      All eyes were now turned on the executioner, who had grown as 
  white as the snows on the summit of Fujiama.  His legs trembled 
  and his breath came in gasps of terror.
      “Several kinds of spike-tailed brass lions!” he cried; “I am a 
  ruined and disgraced swordsman!  I struck the villain feebly 
  because in flourishing the scimetar I had accidentally passed it 
  through my own neck!  Father of the Moon, I resign my office."
      So saying, he gasped his top-knot, lifted off his head, and 
  advancing to the throne laid it humbly at the Mikado’s feet.
SCRAP-BOOK, n.  A book that is commonly edited by a fool.  Many 
persons of some small distinction compile scrap-books containing 
whatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to 
collect.  One of these egotists was addressed in the lines following, 
by Agamemnon Melancthon Peters:
  Dear Frank, that scrap-book where you boast
      You keep a record true
  Of every kind of peppered roast
          That’s made of you;
  Wherein you paste the printed gibes
      That revel round your name,
  Thinking the laughter of the scribes
          Attests your fame;
  Where all the pictures you arrange
      That comic pencils trace —
  Your funny figure and your strange
          Semitic face —
  Pray lend it me.  Wit I have not,
      Nor art, but there I’ll list
  The daily drubbings you’d have got
          Had God a fist.
SCRIBBLER, n.  A professional writer whose views are antagonistic to 
one’s own.
SCRIPTURES, n.  The sacred books of our holy religion, as 
distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other 
faiths are based.
SEAL, n.  A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest 
their authenticity and authority.  Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, 
and attached to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself.  Sealing, 
in this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing 
important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical 
efficacy independent of the authority that they represent.  In the 
British museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a 
sacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other 
devices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in 
many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are 
appended now.  As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless 
custom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote 
utility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense 
evolving in the process of ages into something really useful.  Our 
word “sincere” is derived from sine cero, without wax, but the 
learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence 
of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were 
formerly closed from public scrutiny.  Either view of the matter will 
serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis.  The initials L.S., 
commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean locum 
sigillis, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used 
— an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the 
beasts that perish.  The words locum sigillis are humbly suggested 
as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take 
their place as a sovereign State of the American Union.
SEINE, n.  A kind of net for effecting an involuntary change of 
environment.  For fish it is made strong and coarse, but women are 
more easily taken with a singularly delicate fabric weighted with 
small, cut stones.
  The devil casting a seine of lace,
      (With precious stones ’twas weighted)
  Drew it into the landing place
      And its contents calculated.
  All souls of women were in that sack —
      A draft miraculous, precious!
  But ere he could throw it across his back
      They’d all escaped through the meshes.
Baruch de Loppis

SELF-ESTEEM, n.  An erroneous appraisement.
SELF-EVIDENT, adj.  Evident to one’s self and to nobody else.
SELFISH, adj.  Devoid of consideration for the selfishness of others.
SENATE, n.  A body of elderly gentlemen charged with high duties and 
misdemeanors.
SERIAL, n.  A literary work, usually a story that is not true, 
creeping through several issues of a newspaper or magazine.  
Frequently appended to each installment is a “synposis of preceding 
chapters” for those who have not read them, but a direr need is a 
synposis of succeeding chapters for those who do not intend to read 
them.  A synposis of the entire work would be still better.
  The late James F. Bowman was writing a serial tale for a weekly 
paper in collaboration with a genius whose name has not come down to 
us.  They wrote, not jointly but alternately, Bowman supplying the 
installment for one week, his friend for the next, and so on, world 
without end, they hoped.  Unfortunately they quarreled, and one Monday 
morning when Bowman read the paper to prepare himself for his task, he 
found his work cut out for him in a way to surprise and pain him.  His 
collaborator had embarked every character of the narrative on a ship 
and sunk them all in the deepest part of the Atlantic.
SEVERALTY, n.  Separateness, as, lands in severalty, i.e., lands held 
individually, not in joint ownership.  Certain tribes of Indians are 
believed now to be sufficiently civilized to have in severalty the 
lands that they have hitherto held as tribal organizations, and could 
not sell to the Whites for waxen beads and potato whiskey.
  Lo! the poor Indian whose unsuited mind
  Saw death before, hell and the grave behind;
  Whom thrifty settler ne’er besought to stay —
  His small belongings their appointed prey;
  Whom Dispossession, with alluring wile,
  Persuaded elsewhere every little while!
  His fire unquenched and his undying worm
  By “land in severalty” (charming term!)
  Are cooled and killed, respectively, at last,
  And he to his new holding anchored fast!
SHERIFF, n.  In America the chief executive office of a country, whose 
most characteristic duties, in some of the Western and Southern 
States, are the catching and hanging of rogues.
  John Elmer Pettibone Cajee
  (I write of him with little glee)
  Was just as bad as he could be.
  ’Twas frequently remarked:  “I swon!
  The sun has never looked upon
  So bad a man as Neighbor John.”
  A sinner through and through, he had
  This added fault:  it made him mad
  To know another man was bad.
  In such a case he thought it right
  To rise at any hour of night
  And quench that wicked person’s light.
  Despite the town’s entreaties, he
  Would hale him to the nearest tree
  And leave him swinging wide and free.
  Or sometimes, if the humor came,
  A luckless wight’s reluctant frame
  Was given to the cheerful flame.
  While it was turning nice and brown,
  All unconcerned John met the frown
  Of that austere and righteous town.
  “How sad,” his neighbors said, “that he
  So scornful of the law should be —
  An anar c, h, i, s, t.”
  (That is the way that they preferred
  To utter the abhorrent word,
  So strong the aversion that it stirred.)
  “Resolved,” they said, continuing,
  “That Badman John must cease this thing
  Of having his unlawful fling.
  “Now, by these sacred relics” — here
  Each man had out a souvenir
  Got at a lynching yesteryear —
  “By these we swear he shall forsake
  His ways, nor cause our hearts to ache
  By sins of rope and torch and stake.
  “We’ll tie his red right hand until
  He’ll have small freedom to fulfil
  The mandates of his lawless will.”
  So, in convention then and there,
  They named him Sheriff.  The affair
  Was opened, it is said, with prayer.
J. Milton Sloluck

SIREN, n.  One of several musical prodigies famous for a vain attempt 
to dissuade Odysseus from a life on the ocean wave.  Figuratively, any 
lady of splendid promise, dissembled purpose and disappointing 
performance.
SLANG, n.  The grunt of the human hog (Pignoramus intolerabilis) 
with an audible memory.  The speech of one who utters with his tongue 
what he thinks with his ear, and feels the pride of a creator in 
accomplishing the feat of a parrot.  A means (under Providence) of 
setting up as a wit without a capital of sense.
SMITHAREEN, n.  A fragment, a decomponent part, a remain.  The word is 
used variously, but in the following verse on a noted female reformer 
who opposed bicycle-riding by women because it “led them to the devil” 
it is seen at its best:
  The wheels go round without a sound —
      The maidens hold high revel;
  In sinful mood, insanely gay,
  True spinsters spin adown the way
      From duty to the devil!
  They laugh, they sing, and — ting-a-ling!
      Their bells go all the morning;
  Their lanterns bright bestar the night
      Pedestrians a-warning.
  With lifted hands Miss Charlotte stands,
      Good-Lording and O-mying,
  Her rheumatism forgotten quite,
      Her fat with anger frying.
  She blocks the path that leads to wrath,
      Jack Satan’s power defying.
  The wheels go round without a sound
      The lights burn red and blue and green.
  What’s this that’s found upon the ground?
      Poor Charlotte Smith’s a smithareen!
John William Yope

SOPHISTRY, n.  The controversial method of an opponent, distinguished 
from one’s own by superior insincerity and fooling.  This method is 
that of the later Sophists, a Grecian sect of philosophers who began 
by teaching wisdom, prudence, science, art and, in brief, whatever men 
ought to know, but lost themselves in a maze of quibbles and a fog of 
words.
  His bad opponent’s “facts” he sweeps away,
  And drags his sophistry to light of day;
  Then swears they’re pushed to madness who resort
  To falsehood of so desperate a sort.
  Not so; like sods upon a dead man’s breast,
  He lies most lightly who the least is pressed.
Polydore Smith

SORCERY, n.  The ancient prototype and forerunner of political 
influence.  It was, however, deemed less respectable and sometimes was 
punished by torture and death.  Augustine Nicholas relates that a poor 
peasant who had been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to 
compel a confession.  After enduring a few gentle agonies the 
suffering simpleton admitted his guilt, but naively asked his 
tormentors if it were not possible to be a sorcerer without knowing 
it.
SOUL, n.  A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave 
disputation.  Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of 
existence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of 
eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became 
philosophers.  Plato himself was a philosopher.  The souls that had 
least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and 
despots.  Dionysius I, who had threatened to decapitate the broad- 
browed philosopher, was a usurper and a despot.  Plato, doubtless, was 
not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted 
against his enemies; certainly he was not the last.
  “Concerning the nature of the soul,” saith the renowned author of 
Diversiones Sanctorum, “there hath been hardly more argument than 
that of its place in the body.  Mine own belief is that the soul hath 
her seat in the abdomen — in which faith we may discern and interpret 
a truth hitherto unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men 
most devout.  He is said in the Scripture to ’make a god of his belly’ 
— why, then, should he not be pious, having ever his Deity with him 
to freshen his faith?  Who so well as he can know the might and 
majesty that he shrines?  Truly and soberly, the soul and the stomach 
are one Divine Entity; and such was the belief of Promasius, who 
nevertheless erred in denying it immortality.  He had observed that 
its visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of 
the body after death, but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing.  
This is what we call the Appetite, and it survives the wreck and reek 
of mortality, to be rewarded or punished in another world, according 
to what it hath demanded in the flesh.  The Appetite whose coarse 
clamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the 
public refectory shall be cast into eternal famine, whilst that which 
firmly through civilly insisted on ortolans, caviare, terrapin, 
anchovies, pates de foie gras and all such Christian comestibles 
shall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever and ever, 
and wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the rarest and 
richest wines ever quaffed here below.  Such is my religious faith, 
though I grieve to confess that neither His Holiness the Pope nor His 
Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury (whom I equally and profoundly 
revere) will assent to its dissemination.”
SPOOKER, n.  A writer whose imagination concerns itself with 
supernatural phenomena, especially in the doings of spooks.  One of 
the most illustrious spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells, 
who introduces a well-credentialed reader to as respectable and 
mannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet.  To the terror 
that invests the chairman of a district school board, the Howells 
ghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another 
township.
STORY, n.  A narrative, commonly untrue.  The truth of the stories 
here following has, however, not been successfully impeached.
  One evening Mr. Rudolph Block, of New York, found himself seated 
at dinner alongside Mr. Percival Pollard, the distinguished critic.
  “Mr. Pollard,” said he, “my book, The Biography of a Dead Cow, 
is published anonymously, but you can hardly be ignorant of its 
authorship.  Yet in reviewing it you speak of it as the work of the 
Idiot of the Century.  Do you think that fair criticism?"
  “I am very sorry, sir,” replied the critic, amiably, “but it did 
not occur to me that you really might not wish the public to know who 
wrote it.”
  Mr. W.C. Morrow, who used to live in San Jose, California, was 
addicted to writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a 
stream of lizards, fresh from the ice, were streaking it up his back 
and hiding in his hair.  San Jose was at that time believed to be 
haunted by the visible spirit of a noted bandit named Vasquez, who had 
been hanged there.  The town was not very well lighted, and it is 
putting it mildly to say that San Jose was reluctant to be out o’ 
nights.  One particularly dark night two gentlemen were abroad in the 
loneliest spot within the city limits, talking loudly to keep up their 
courage, when they came upon Mr. J.J. Owen, a well-known journalist.
  “Why, Owen,” said one, “what brings you here on such a night as 
this?  You told me that this is one of Vasquez’ favorite haunts!  And 
you are a believer.  Aren’t you afraid to be out?"
  “My dear fellow,” the journalist replied with a drear autumnal 
cadence in his speech, like the moan of a leaf-laden wind, “I am 
afraid to be in.  I have one of Will Morrow’s stories in my pocket and 
I don’t dare to go where there is light enough to read it."
  Rear-Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F. Joy were 
standing near the Peace Monument, in Washington, discussing the 
question, Is success a failure?  Mr. Joy suddenly broke off in the 
middle of an eloquent sentence, exclaiming:  “Hello!  I’ve heard that 
band before.  Santlemann’s, I think."
  “I don’t hear any band,” said Schley.
  “Come to think, I don’t either,” said Joy; “but I see General 
Miles coming down the avenue, and that pageant always affects me in 
the same way as a brass band.  One has to scrutinize one’s impressions 
pretty closely, or one will mistake their origin."
  While the Admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy 
General Miles passed in review, a spectacle of impressive dignity.  
When the tail of the seeming procession had passed and the two 
observers had recovered from the transient blindness caused by its 
effulgence —
  “He seems to be enjoying himself,” said the Admiral.
  “There is nothing,” assented Joy, thoughtfully, “that he enjoys 
one-half so well.”
  The illustrious statesman, Champ Clark, once lived about a mile 
from the village of Jebigue, in Missouri.  One day he rode into town 
on a favorite mule, and, hitching the beast on the sunny side of a 
street, in front of a saloon, he went inside in his character of 
teetotaler, to apprise the barkeeper that wine is a mocker.  It was a 
dreadfully hot day.  Pretty soon a neighbor came in and seeing Clark, 
said:
  “Champ, it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun.  
He’ll roast, sure! — he was smoking as I passed him."
  “O, he’s all right,” said Clark, lightly; “he’s an inveterate 
smoker."
  The neighbor took a lemonade, but shook his head and repeated that 
it was not right.
  He was a conspirator.  There had been a fire the night before:  a 
stable just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had 
put on their immortality, among them a young colt, which was roasted 
to a rich nut-brown.  Some of the boys had turned Mr. Clark’s mule 
loose and substituted the mortal part of the colt.  Presently another 
man entered the saloon.
  “For mercy’s sake!” he said, taking it with sugar, “do remove that 
mule, barkeeper:  it smells."
  “Yes,” interposed Clark, “that animal has the best nose in 
Missouri.  But if he doesn’t mind, you shouldn’t."
  In the course of human events Mr. Clark went out, and there, 
apparently, lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger. 
The boys idd not have any fun out of Mr. Clarke, who looked at the 
body and, with the non-committal expression to which he owes so much 
of his political preferment, went away.  But walking home late that 
night he saw his mule standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the 
misty moonlight.  Mentioning the name of Helen Blazes with uncommon 
emphasis, Mr. Clark took the back track as hard as ever he could hook 
it, and passed the night in town.
  General H.H. Wotherspoon, president of the Army War College, has a 
pet rib-nosed baboon, an animal of uncommon intelligence but 
imperfectly beautiful.  Returning to his apartment one evening, the 
General was surprised and pained to find Adam (for so the creature is 
named, the general being a Darwinian) sitting up for him and wearing 
his master’s best uniform coat, epaulettes and all.
  “You confounded remote ancestor!” thundered the great strategist, 
“what do you mean by being out of bed after naps? — and with my coat 
on!"
  Adam rose and with a reproachful look got down on all fours in the 
manner of his kind and, scuffling across the room to a table, returned 
with a visiting-card:  General Barry had called and, judging by an 
empty champagne bottle and several cigar-stumps, had been hospitably 
entertained while waiting.  The general apologized to his faithful 
progenitor and retired.  The next day he met General Barry, who said:
  “Spoon, old man, when leaving you last evening I forgot to ask you 
about those excellent cigars.  Where did you get them?"
  General Wotherspoon did not deign to reply, but walked away.
  “Pardon me, please,” said Barry, moving after him; “I was joking 
of course.  Why, I knew it was not you before I had been in the room 
fifteen minutes.”
SUCCESS, n.  The one unpardonable sin against one’s fellows.  In 
literature, and particularly in poetry, the elements of success are 
exceedingly simple, and are admirably set forth in the following lines 
by the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape, entitled, for some mysterious 
reason, “John A. Joyce.”
  The bard who would prosper must carry a book,
      Do his thinking in prose and wear
  A crimson cravat, a far-away look
      And a head of hexameter hair.
  Be thin in your thought and your body’ll be fat;
  If you wear your hair long you needn’t your hat.
SUFFRAGE, n.  Expression of opinion by means of a ballot.  The right 
of suffrage (which is held to be both a privilege and a duty) means, 
as commonly interpreted, the right to vote for the man of another 
man’s choice, and is highly prized.  Refusal to do so has the bad name 
of “incivism.”  The incivilian, however, cannot be properly arraigned
for his crime, for there is no legitimate accuser.  If the accuser is 
himself guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion; if not, he 
profits by the crime, for A’s abstention from voting gives greater 
weight to the vote of B.  By female suffrage is meant the right of a 
woman to vote as some man tells her to.  It is based on female 
responsibility, which is somewhat limited.  The woman most eager to 
jump out of her petticoat to assert her rights is first to jump back 
into it when threatened with a switching for misusing them.
SYCOPHANT, n.  One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he 
may not be commanded to turn and be kicked.  He is sometimes an 
editor.
  As the lean leech, its victim found, is pleased
  To fix itself upon a part diseased
  Till, its black hide distended with bad blood,
  It drops to die of surfeit in the mud,
  So the base sycophant with joy descries
  His neighbor’s weak spot and his mouth applies,
  Gorges and prospers like the leech, although,
  Unlike that reptile, he will not let go.
  Gelasma, if it paid you to devote
  Your talent to the service of a goat,
  Showing by forceful logic that its beard
  Is more than Aaron’s fit to be revered;
  If to the task of honoring its smell
  Profit had prompted you, and love as well,
  The world would benefit at last by you
  And wealthy malefactors weep anew —
  Your favor for a moment’s space denied
  And to the nobler object turned aside.
  Is’t not enough that thrifty millionaires
  Who loot in freight and spoliate in fares,
  Or, cursed with consciences that bid them fly
  To safer villainies of darker dye,
  Forswearing robbery and fain, instead,
  To steal (they call it “cornering”) our bread
  May see you groveling their boots to lick
  And begging for the favor of a kick?
  Still must you follow to the bitter end
  Your sycophantic disposition’s trend,
  And in your eagerness to please the rich
  Hunt hungry sinners to their final ditch?
  In Morgan’s praise you smite the sounding wire,
  And sing hosannas to great Havemeyher!
  What’s Satan done that him you should eschew?
  He too is reeking rich — deducting you.
SYLLOGISM, n.  A logical formula consisting of a major and a minor 
assumption and an inconsequent.  (See LOGIC.)
SYLPH, n.  An immaterial but visible being that inhabited the air when 
the air was an element and before it was fatally polluted with factory 
smoke, sewer gas and similar products of civilization.  Sylphs were 
allied to gnomes, nymphs and salamanders, which dwelt, respectively, 
in earth, water and fire, all now insalubrious.  Sylphs, like fowls of 
the air, were male and female, to no purpose, apparently, for if they 
had progeny they must have nested in accessible places, none of the 
chicks having ever been seen.
SYMBOL, n.  Something that is supposed to typify or stand for 
something else.  Many symbols are mere “survivals” — things which 
having no longer any utility continue to exist because we have 
inherited the tendency to make them; as funereal urns carved on 
memorial monuments.  They were once real urns holding the ashes of the 
dead.  We cannot stop making them, but we can give them a name that 
conceals our helplessness.
SYMBOLIC, adj.  Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation 
of symbols.
  They say ’tis conscience feels compunction;
  I hold that that’s the stomach’s function,
  For of the sinner I have noted
  That when he’s sinned he’s somewhat bloated,
  Or ill some other ghastly fashion
  Within that bowel of compassion.
  True, I believe the only sinner
  Is he that eats a shabby dinner.
  You know how Adam with good reason,
  For eating apples out of season,
  Was “cursed.”  But that is all symbolic:
  The truth is, Adam had the colic.
G.J.
