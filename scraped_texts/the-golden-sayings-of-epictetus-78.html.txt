Who then is a Stoic—in the sense that we call that a statue of
Phidias which is modelled after that master’s art? Show me a man
in this sense modelled after the doctrines that are ever upon his

Grudge it not to an old man, to behold a sight that he has never

Phidias, bedecked with gold and ivory?—Nay, show me, one of

nothing to cross him, to yield neither to anger, envy, nor
jealousy—in a word, why disguise the matter? one that from a
man would fain become a God; one that while still imprisoned
in this dead body makes fellowship with God his aim. Show me

thieves and robbers that you are of names and things to which
you can show no title!
