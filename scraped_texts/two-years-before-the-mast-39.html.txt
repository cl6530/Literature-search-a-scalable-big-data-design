Friday, Sept. 16th.  Lat. 38° N., long. 69° 00’ W.  A fine south-west
wind; every hour carrying us nearer in toward land.  All hands on deck
at the dog watch, and nothing talked about, but our getting in; where
we should make the land; whether we should arrive before Sunday;
going to church; how Boston would look; friends; wages paid;–and
the like.  Every one was in the best of spirits; and, the voyage
being nearly at an end, the strictness of discipline was relaxed;
for it was not necessary to order in a cross tone, what every one
was ready to do with a will.
The little differences and quarrels which a long voyage breeds
on board a ship, were forgotten, and every one was friendly;
and two men, who had been on the eve of a battle half the voyage,
were laying out a plan together for a cruise on shore.  When the
mate came forward, he talked to the men, and said we should be
on George’s Bank before to-morrow noon; and joked with the boys,
promising to go and see them, and to take them down to Marblehead
in a coach.
Saturday, 17th.  The wind was light all day, which kept us back
somewhat; but a fine breeze springing up at nightfall, we were
running fast in toward the land.  At six o’clock we expected to
have the ship hove-to for soundings, as a thick fog, coming up
showed we were near them; but no order was given, and we kept
on our way.  Eight o’clock came, and the watch went below,
and, for the whole of the first hour, the ship was tearing on,
with studding-sails out, alow and aloft, and the night as dark
as a pocket.  At two bells the captain came on deck, and said a
word to the mate, when the studding sails were hauled into the
tops, or boom-ended, the after yards backed, the deep-sea-lead
carried forward, and everything got ready for sounding.  A man
on the spritsail yard with the lead, another on the cathead with
a handful of the line coiled up, another in the fore chains,
another in the waist, and another in the main chains, each with
a quantity of the line coiled away in his hand.  “All ready there,
forward?"–"Aye, aye, sir!"–"He-e-e-ave!"–"Watch! ho! watch!"
sings out the man on the spritsail yard, and the heavy lead drops
into the water.  “Watch! ho! watch!” bawls the man on the cat-head,
as the last fake of the coil drops from his hand, and “Watch! ho!
watch!” is shouted by each one as the line falls from his hold;
until it comes to the mate, who tends the lead, and has the line
in coils on the quarter-deck.  Eighty fathoms, and no bottom!  A
depth as great as the height of St. Peter’s!  The line is snatched
in a block upon the swifter, and three or four men haul it in and
coil it away.  The after yards are braced full, the studding-sails
hauled out again, and in a few minutes more the ship had her
whole way upon her.  At four bells, backed again, hove the lead,
and–soundings! at sixty fathoms!  Hurrah for Yankee land!  Hand
over hand, we hauled the lead in, and the captain, taking it to
the light, found black mud on the bottom.
Studding-sails taken in; after yards filled, and ship kept on under
easy sail all night; the wind dying away. 
The soundings on the American coast are so regular that a navigator
knows as well where he has made land, by the soundings, as he
would by seeing the land.  Black mud is the soundings of Block
Island.  As you go toward Nantucket, it changes to a dark sand;
then, sand and white shells; and on George’s Banks, white sand;
and so on.  Being off Block Island, our course was due east, to
Nantucket Shoals, and the South Channel; but the wind died away
and left us becalmed in a thick fog, in which we lay the whole
of Sunday.  At noon of
Sunday, 18th, Block Island bore, by calculation, N. W. 1/4 W.
fifteen miles; but the fog was so thick all day that we could see
nothing. 
Having got through the ship’s duty, and washed and shaved, we went
below, and had a fine time overhauling our chests, laying aside the
clothes we meant to go ashore in and throwing overboard all that were
worn out and good for nothing.  Away went the woollen caps in which
we had carried hides upon our heads, for sixteen months, on the
coast of California; the duck frocks, for tarring down rigging;
and the worn-out and darned mittens and patched woollen trowsers
which had stood the tug of Cape Horn.
We hove them overboard with a good will; for there is nothing
like being quit of the very last appendages and remnants of
our evil fortune.  We got our chests all ready for going ashore,
ate the last “duff” we expected to have on board the ship Alert;
and talked as confidently about matters on shore as though our
anchor were on the bottom.
“Who’ll go to church with me a week from to-day?” 
“I will,” says Jack; who said aye to everything. 
“Go away, salt water!” says Tom.  “As soon as I get both legs
ashore, I’m going to shoe my heels, and button my ears behind me,
and start off into the bush, a straight course, and not stop till
I’m out of the sight of salt water!”
“Oh! belay that!  Spin that yarn where nobody knows your filling!
If you get once moored, stem and stern, in old B––-’s grog-shop,
with a coal fire ahead and the bar under your lee, you won’t see
daylight for three weeks!”
“No!” says Tom, “I’m going to knock off grog, and go and board
at the Home, and see if they won’t ship me for a deacon!” 
“And I,” says Bill, “am going to buy a quadrant and ship for
navigator of a Hingham packet!” 
These and the like jokes served to pass the time while we were
lying waiting for a breeze to clear up the fog and send us on our
way. 
Toward night a moderate breeze sprang up; the fog however continuing
as thick as before; and we kept on to the eastward.  About the middle
of the first watch, a man on the forecastle sang out, in a tone which
showed that there was not a moment to be lost,–"Hard up the helm!"
and a great ship loomed up out of the fog, coming directly down
upon us.  She luffed at the same moment, and we just passed one
another; our spanker boom grazing over her quarter.  The officer
of the deck had only time to hail, and she answered, as she went
into the fog again, something about Bristol–probably, a whaleman
from Bristol, Rhode Island, bound out.  The fog continued through the
night, with a very light breeze, before which we ran to the eastward,
literally feeling our way along.  The lead was heaved every two hours,
and the gradual change from black mud to sand, showed that we were
approaching Nantucket South Shoals.  On Monday morning, the increased
depth and deep blue color of the water, and the mixture of shells and
white sand which we brought up, upon sounding, showed that we were
in the channel, and nearing George’s; accordingly, the ship’s head
was put directly to the northward, and we stood on, with perfect
confidence in the soundings, though we had not taken an observation
for two days, nor seen land; and the difference of an eighth of
a mile out of the way might put us ashore.  Throughout the day a
provokingly light wind prevailed, and at eight o’clock, a small
fishing schooner, which we passed, told us we were nearly abreast
of Chatham lights.
Just before midnight, a light land-breeze sprang up, which carried
us well along; and at four o’clock, thinking ourselves to the
northward of Race Point, we hauled upon the wind and stood
into the bay, west-north-west, for Boston light, and commenced
firing guns for a pilot.  Our watch went below at four o’clock,
but could not sleep, for the watch on deck were banging away at
the guns every few minutes.  And, indeed, we cared very little
about it, for we were in Boston Bay; and if fortune favored us,
we could all “sleep in” the next night, with nobody to call the
watch every four hours.
We turned out, of our own will, at daybreak, to get a sight of land. 
In the grey of the morning, one or two small fishing smacks peered
out of the mist; and when the broad day broke upon us, there lay the
low sand-hills of Cape Cod, over our larboard quarter, and before us,
the wide waters of Massachusetts Bay, with here and there a sail
gliding over its smooth surface.  As we drew in toward the mouth
of the harbor, as toward a focus, the vessels began to multiply
until the bay seemed actually alive with sails gliding about in
every direction; some on the wind, and others before it, as they
were bound to or from the emporium of trade and centre of the bay.
It was a stirring sight for us, who had been months on the ocean
without seeing anything but two solitary sails; and over two years
without seeing more than the three or four traders on an almost
desolate coast.  There were the little coasters, bound to and
from the various towns along the south shore, down in the bight
of the bay, and to the eastward; here and there a square-rigged
vessel standing out to seaward; and, far in the distance,
beyond Cape Ann, was the smoke of a steamer, stretching along in
a narrow, black cloud upon the water.  Every sight was full of
beauty and interest.  We were coming back to our homes; and the
signs of civilization, and prosperity, and happiness, from which
we had been so long banished, were multiplying about us.  The high
land of Cape Ann and the rocks and shore of Cohasset were full in
sight, the lighthouses, standing like sentries in white before
the harbors, and even the smoke from the chimney on the plains
of Hingham was seen rising slowly in the morning air.  One of
our boys was the son of a bucket-maker; and his face lighted
up as he saw the tops of the well-known hills which surround his
native place.  About ten o’clock a little boat came bobbing over
the water, and put a pilot on board, and sheered off in pursuit
of other vessels bound in.
Being now within the scope of the telegraph stations, our signals
were run up at the fore, and in half an hour afterwards, the owner
on ’change, or in his counting-room, knew that his ship was below;
and the landlords, runners, and sharks in Ann street learned that
there was a rich prize for them down in the bay: a ship from round
the Horn, with a crew to be paid off with two years’ wages.
The wind continuing very light, all hands were sent aloft to
strip off the chafing gear; and battens, parcellings, roundings,
hoops, mats, and leathers, came flying from aloft, and left the
rigging neat and clean, stripped of all its sea bandaging.  The
last touch was put to the vessel by painting the skysail poles;
and I was sent up to the fore, with a bucket of white paint and
a brush, and touched her off, from the truck to the eyes of the
royal rigging.  At noon, we lay becalmed off the lower light-house;
and it being about slack water, we made little progress.  A firing
was heard in the direction of Hingham, and the pilot said there
was a review there.
The Hingham boy got wind of this, and said if the ship had been
twelve hours sooner, he should have been down among the soldiers,
and in the booths, and having a grand time.  As it was, we had
little prospect of getting in before night.  About two o’clock a
breeze sprang up ahead, from the westward, and we began beating
up against it.  A full-rigged brig was beating in at the same
time, and we passed one another, in our tacks, sometimes one
and sometimes the other, working to windward, as the wind and
tide favored or opposed.  It was my trick at the wheel from two
till four; and I stood my last helm, making between nine hundred
and a thousand hours which I had spent at the helms of our two
vessels.  The tide beginning to set against us, we made slow work;
and the afternoon was nearly spent, before we got abreast of the
inner light.  In the meantime, several vessels were coming down,
outward bound; among which, a fine, large ship, with yards squared,
fair wind and fair tide, passed us like a race-horse, the men
running out upon her yards to rig out the studding-sail booms.
Toward sundown the wind came off in flaws, sometimes blowing
very stiff, so that the pilot took in the royals, and then it
died away; when, in order to get us in before the tide became
too strong, the royals were set again.  As this kept us running
up and down the rigging all the time, one hand was sent aloft at
each mast-head, to stand-by to loose and furl the sails, at the
moment of the order.  I took my place at the fore, and loosed
and furled the royal five times between Rainsford Island and the
Castle.  At one tack we ran so near to Rainsford Island, that,
looking down from the royal yard, the island, with its hospital
buildings, nice gravelled walks, and green plats, seemed to lie
directly under our yard-arms.  So close is the channel to some of
these islands, that we ran the end of our flying-jib-boom over
one of the out-works of the fortifications on George’s Island;
and had an opportunity of seeing the advantages of that point as
a fortified place; for, in working up the channel, we presented
a fair stem and stern, for raking, from the batteries, three or
four times.  One gun might have knocked us to pieces.
We had all set our hearts upon getting up to town before night
and going ashore, but the tide beginning to run strong against us,
and the wind, what there was of it, being ahead, we made but little
by weather-bowing the tide, and the pilot gave orders to cock-bill
the anchor and overhaul the chain.  Making two long stretches,
which brought us into the roads, under the lee of the castle,
he clewed up the topsails, and let go the anchor; and for the
first time since leaving San Diego,–one hundred and thirty-five
days–our anchor was upon bottom.  In half an hour more, we were
lying snugly, with all sails furled, safe in Boston harbor;
our long voyage ended; the well-known scene about us; the dome
of the State House fading in the western sky; the lights of the
city starting into sight, as the darkness came on; and at nine
o’clock the clangor of the bells, ringing their accustomed peals;
among which the Boston boys tried to distinguish the well-known
tone of the Old South.
We had just done furling the sails, when a beautiful little
pleasure-boat luffed up into the wind, under our quarter, and the
junior partner of the firm to which our ship belonged, jumped on
board.  I saw him from the mizen topsail yard, and knew him well. 
He shook the captain by the hand, and went down into the cabin,
and in a few moments came up and inquired of the mate for me. 
The last time I had seen him, I was in the uniform of an undergraduate
of Harvard College, and now, to his astonishment, there came down
from aloft a “rough alley” looking fellow, with duck trowsers and
red shirt, long hair, and face burnt as black as an Indian’s.
He shook me by the hand, congratulated me upon my return and my
appearance of health and strength, and said my friends were all
well.  I thanked him for telling me what I should not have dared
to ask; and if–
“the first bringer of unwelcome news
Hath but a losing office; and his tongue
Sounds ever after like a sullen bell–”
certainly I shall ever remember this man and his words with
pleasure. 
The captain went up to town in the boat with Mr. H––-, and left
us to pass another night on board ship, and to come up with the
morning’s tide under command of the pilot. 
So much did we feel ourselves to be already at home, in anticipation,
that our plain supper of hard bread and salt beef was barely touched;
and many on board, to whom this was the first voyage, could scarcely
sleep.  As for myself, by one of those anomalous changes of feeling
of which we are all the subjects, I found that I was in a state
of indifference, for which I could by no means account.  A year
before, while carrying hides on the coast, the assurance that in a
twelvemonth we should see Boston, made me half wild; but now that I
was actually there, and in sight of home, the emotions which I had
so long anticipated feeling, I did not find, and in their place
was a state of very nearly entire apathy.  Something of the same
experience was related to me by a sailor whose first voyage was
one of five years upon the North-west Coast.  He had left home,
a lad, and after several years of very hard and trying experience,
found himself homeward bound; and such was the excitement of his
feelings that, during the whole passage, he could talk and think
of nothing else but his arrival, and how and when he should jump
from the vessel and take his way directly home.  Yet when the vessel
was made fast to the wharf and the crew dismissed, he seemed suddenly
to lose all feeling about the matter.  He told me that he went below
and changed his dress; took some water from the scuttle-butt and
washed himself leisurely; overhauled his chest, and put his clothes
all in order; took his pipe from its place, filled it, and sitting
down upon his chest, smoked it slowly for the last time.  Here he
looked round upon the forecastle in which he had spent so many
years, and being alone and his shipmates scattered, he began to
feel actually unhappy.  Home became almost a dream; and it was not
until his brother (who had heard of the ship’s arrival) came down
into the forecastle and told him of things at home, and who were
waiting there to see him, that he could realize where he was, and
feel interest enough to put him in motion toward that place for
which he had longed, and of which he had dreamed, for years.
There is probably so much of excitement in prolonged expectation,
that the quiet realizing of it produces a momentary stagnation of
feeling as well as of effort.  It was a good deal so with me.  The
activity of preparation, the rapid progress of the ship, the first
making land, the coming up the harbor, and old scenes breaking upon
the view, produced a mental as well as bodily activity, from which
the change to a perfect stillness, when both expectation and the
necessity of labor failed, left a calmness, almost of indifference,
from which I must be roused by some new excitement.  And the next
morning, when all hands were called, and we were busily at work,
clearing the decks, and getting everything in readiness for going up
to the wharves,–loading the guns for a salute, loosing the sails,
and manning the windlass–mind and body seemed to wake together.
About ten o’clock, a sea-breeze sprang up, and the pilot gave orders
to get the ship under weigh.  All hands manned the windlass, and the
long-drawn “Yo, heave, ho!” which we had last heard dying away
among the desolate hills of San Diego, soon brought the anchor to
the bows; and, with a fair wind and tide, a bright sunny morning,
royals and sky-sails set, ensign, streamer, signals, and pennant,
flying, and with our guns firing, we came swiftly and handsomely
up to the city.  Off the end of the wharf, we rounded-to and let
go our anchor; and no sooner was it on the bottom, than the decks
were filled with people: custom-house officers; Topliff’s agent,
to inquire for news; others, inquiring for friends on board, or
left upon the coast; dealers in grease, besieging the galley to
make a bargain with the cook for his slush; “loafers” in general;
and last and chief, boarding-house runners, to secure their men.
Nothing can exceed the obliging disposition of these runners,
and the interest they take in a sailor returned from a long voyage
with a plenty of money.  Two or three of them, at different times,
took me by the hand; remembered me perfectly; were quite sure I
had boarded with them before I sailed; were delighted to see me
back; gave me their cards; had a hand-cart waiting on the wharf,
on purpose to take my things up: would lend me a hand to get my
chest ashore; bring a bottle of grog on board if we did not haul
in immediately,–and the like.  In fact, we could hardly get clear
of them, to go aloft and furl the sails.  Sail after sail, for the
hundredth time, in fair weather and in foul, we furled now for
the last time together, and came down and took the warp ashore,
manned the capstan, and with a chorus which waked up half the
North End, and rang among the buildings in the dock, we hauled
her in to the wharf.  Here, too, the landlords and runners were
active and ready, taking a bar to the capstan, lending a hand at
the ropes, laughing and talking and telling the news.  The city
bells were just ringing one when the last turn was made fast,
and the crew dismissed; and in five minutes more, not a soul
was left on board the good ship Alert, but the old ship-keeper,
who had come down from the counting-house to take charge of her.
