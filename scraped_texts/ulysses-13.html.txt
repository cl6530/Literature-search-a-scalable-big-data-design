PADDY LEONARD: Thank you.

BLOOM: (OBDURATELY) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are
bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five
pounds.
J. J. O’MOLLOY: A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O’Brien!
NOSEY FLYNN: Where do I draw the five pounds?
PISSER BURKE: For bladder trouble?
Bloom:

CHRIS CALLINAN: What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of
Aldebaran?
BLOOM: Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.
JOE HYNES: Why aren’t you in uniform?
BLOOM: When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the
Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?
BEN DOLLARD: Pansies?
BLOOM: Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.
BEN DOLLARD: When twins arrive?
BLOOM: Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.
LARRY O’ROURKE: An eightday licence for my new premises. You remember me,
sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I’m sending around a dozen of
stout for the missus.
BLOOM: (COLDLY) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no
presents.
CROFTON: This is indeed a festivity.
BLOOM: (SOLEMNLY) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.
ALEXANDER KEYES: When will we have our own house of keys?
BLOOM: I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten
commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile.
Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses.
Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and
night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy
must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival with masked licence,
bonuses for all, esperanto the universal language with universal
brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors.
Free money, free rent, free love and a free lay church in a free lay
state.
O’MADDEN BURKE: Free fox in a free henroost.
DAVY BYRNE: (YAWNING) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!
BLOOM: Mixed races and mixed marriage.
LENEHAN: What about mixed bathing?
(BLOOM EXPLAINS TO THOSE NEAR HIM HIS SCHEMES FOR SOCIAL REGENERATION.

VOTING, GASTRONOMY, PRIVATE HYGIENE, SEASIDE CONCERT ENTERTAINMENTS,

FATHER FARLEY: He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an anythingarian
seeking to overthrow our holy faith.
MRS RIORDAN: (TEARS UP HER WILL) I’m disappointed in you! You bad man!
MOTHER GROGAN: (REMOVES HER BOOT TO THROW IT AT BLOOM) You beast! You
abominable person!
NOSEY FLYNN: Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.
Bloom: (with Rollicking Humour)
    I vowed that I never would leave her,
    She turned out a cruel deceiver.
    With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom.
HOPPY HOLOHAN: Good old Bloom! There’s nobody like him after all.
PADDY LEONARD: Stage Irishman!
BLOOM: What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of
Casteele. (LAUGHTER.)
LENEHAN: Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!
THE VEILED SIBYL: (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) I’m a Bloomite and I glory in it. I
believe in him in spite of all. I’d give my life for him, the funniest
man on earth.
BLOOM: (WINKS AT THE BYSTANDERS) I bet she’s a bonny lassie.
THEODORE PUREFOY: (IN FISHINGCAP AND OILSKIN JACKET) He employs a
mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.
THE VEILED SIBYL: (STABS HERSELF) My hero god! (SHE DIES)

THEMSELVES IN STYLISH GARTERS, LEAPING FROM WINDOWS OF DIFFERENT
STOREYS.)
ALEXANDER J DOWIE: (VIOLENTLY) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the
man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men.
A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes
gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the cities of
the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with
infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of
the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake
faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!
THE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He’s as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
(MOTHER GROGAN THROWS HER BOOT AT BLOOM. SEVERAL SHOPKEEPERS FROM UPPER
AND LOWER DORSET STREET THROW OBJECTS OF LITTLE OR NO COMMERCIAL VALUE,
HAMBONES, CONDENSED MILK TINS, UNSALEABLE CABBAGE, STALE BREAD, SHEEP’S
TAILS, ODD PIECES OF FAT.)
BLOOM: (EXCITEDLY) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By
heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He
is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin’s Barn. Slander, the viper,
has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, SGENL INN BAN BATA COISDE
GAN CAPALL. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist,
to give medical testimony on my behalf.
DR MULLIGAN: (IN MOTOR JERKIN, GREEN MOTORGOGGLES ON HIS BROW) Dr Bloom
is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace’s private
asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is
present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have
been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of
chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely
bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed
rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has
temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against
than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application
of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I
declare him to be VIRGO INTACTA.
(bloom Holds His High Grade Hat Over His Genital Organs.)
DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming
generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in
spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient’s urine. It is albuminoid.
Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The FETOR JUDAICUS is most perceptible.
DR DIXON: (READS A BILL OF HEALTH) Professor Bloom is a finished example
of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have
found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the
whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a
really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the
Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which clears up everything. He is
practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw
litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer’s peas. He wears
a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourges
himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass
misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a
very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most
sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is
about to have a baby.

BLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.
MRS THORNTON: (IN NURSETENDER’S GOWN) Embrace me tight, dear. You’ll be
soon over it. Tight, dear.
(BLOOM EMBRACES HER TIGHTLY AND BEARS EIGHT MALE YELLOW AND WHITE

A HOLLYBUSH: And in the devil’s glen?
BLOOM: (BLUSHES FURIOUSLY ALL OVER FROM FRONS TO NATES, THREE TEARS

all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

SHRUNKEN, CARBONISED.)
ZOE: Talk away till you’re black in the face.
BLOOM: (IN CAUBEEN WITH CLAY PIPE STUCK IN THE BAND, DUSTY BROGUES, AN
EMIGRANT’S RED HANDKERCHIEF BUNDLE IN HIS HAND, LEADING A BLACK BOGOAK
PIG BY A SUGAUN, WITH A SMILE IN HIS EYE) Let me be going now, woman of
the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I’m after having the father
and mother of a bating. (WITH A TEAR IN HIS EYE) All insanity.
Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not
to be. Life’s dream is o’er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (HE
GAZES FAR AWAY MOURNFULLY) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The
blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (HE BREATHES SOFTLY) No
more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.
ZOE: (STIFFLY, HER FINGER IN HER NECKFILLET) Honest? Till the next time.
(SHE SNEERS) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too
quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts!
BLOOM: (BITTERLY) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle. I’m
sick of it. Let everything rip.
ZOE: (IN SUDDEN SULKS) I hate a rotter that’s insincere. Give a bleeding
whore a chance.
BLOOM: (REPENTANTLY) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil.
Where are you from? London?
ZOE: (GLIBLY) Hog’s Norton where the pigs plays the organs. I’m Yorkshire
born. (SHE HOLDS HIS HAND WHICH IS FEELING FOR HER NIPPLE) I say, Tommy
Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time?
Ten shillings?
BLOOM: (SMILES, NODS SLOWLY) More, houri, more.
ZOE: And more’s mother? (SHE PATS HIM OFFHANDEDLY WITH VELVET PAWS) Are
you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I’ll peel
off.
BLOOM: (FEELING HIS OCCIPUT DUBIOUSLY WITH THE UNPARALLELED EMBARRASSMENT
OF A HARASSED PEDLAR GAUGING THE SYMMETRY OF HER PEELED PEARS) Somebody
would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster.
(EARNESTLY) You know how difficult it is. I needn’t tell you.
ZOE: (FLATTERED) What the eye can’t see the heart can’t grieve for. (SHE
PATS HIM) Come.
BLOOM: Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.
ZOE: Babby!
BLOOM: (IN BABYLINEN AND PELISSE, BIGHEADED, WITH A CAUL OF DARK HAIR,
FIXES BIG EYES ON HER FLUID SLIP AND COUNTS ITS BRONZE BUCKLES WITH A
CHUBBY FINGER, HIS MOIST TONGUE LOLLING AND LISPING) One two tlee: tlee
tlwo tlone.
THE BUCKLES: Love me. Love me not. Love me.
ZOE: Silent means consent. (WITH LITTLE PARTED TALONS SHE CAPTURES HIS
HAND, HER FOREFINGER GIVING TO HIS PALM THE PASSTOUCH OF SECRET MONITOR,
LURING HIM TO DOOM.) Hot hands cold gizzard.
(HE HESITATES AMID SCENTS, MUSIC, TEMPTATIONS. SHE LEADS HIM TOWARDS THE
STEPS, DRAWING HIM BY THE ODOUR OF HER ARMPITS, THE VICE OF HER PAINTED
EYES, THE RUSTLE OF HER SLIP IN WHOSE SINUOUS FOLDS LURKS THE LION REEK
OF ALL THE MALE BRUTES THAT HAVE POSSESSED HER.)
THE MALE BRUTES: (EXHALING SULPHUR OF RUT AND DUNG AND RAMPING IN THEIR
LOOSEBOX, FAINTLY ROARING, THEIR DRUGGED HEADS SWAYING TO AND FRO) Good!
(ZOE AND BLOOM REACH THE DOORWAY WHERE TWO SISTER WHORES ARE SEATED. THEY
EXAMINE HIM CURIOUSLY FROM UNDER THEIR PENCILLED BROWS AND SMILE TO HIS
HASTY BOW. HE TRIPS AWKWARDLY.)
ZOE: (HER LUCKY HAND INSTANTLY SAVING HIM) Hoopsa! Don’t fall upstairs.
BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. (HE STANDS ASIDE AT THE THRESHOLD)
After you is good manners.
ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.
(SHE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD. HE HESITATES. SHE TURNS AND, HOLDING OUT HER
HANDS, DRAWS HIM OVER. HE HOPS. ON THE ANTLERED RACK OF THE HALL HANG A
MAN ’S HAT AND WATERPROOF. BLOOM UNCOVERS HIMSELF BUT, SEEING THEM,
FROWNS, THEN SMILES, PREOCCUPIED. A DOOR ON THE RETURN LANDING IS FLUNG
OPEN. A MAN IN PURPLE SHIRT AND GREY TROUSERS, BROWNSOCKED, PASSES WITH
AN APE’S GAIT, HIS BALD HEAD AND GOATEE BEARD UPHELD, HUGGING A FULL
WATERJUGJAR, HIS TWOTAILED BLACK BRACES DANGLING AT HEELS. AVERTING HIS
FACE QUICKLY BLOOM BENDS TO EXAMINE ON THE HALLTABLE THE SPANIEL EYES OF
A RUNNING FOX: THEN, HIS LIFTED HEAD SNIFFING, FOLLOWS ZOE INTO THE
MUSICROOM. A SHADE OF MAUVE TISSUEPAPER DIMS THE LIGHT OF THE CHANDELIER.
ROUND AND ROUND A MOTH FLIES, COLLIDING, ESCAPING. THE FLOOR IS COVERED
WITH AN OILCLOTH MOSAIC OF JADE AND AZURE AND CINNABAR RHOMBOIDS.
FOOTMARKS ARE STAMPED OVER IT IN ALL SENSES, HEEL TO HEEL, HEEL TO
HOLLOW, TOE TO TOE, FEET LOCKED, A MORRIS OF SHUFFLING FEET WITHOUT BODY
PHANTOMS, ALL IN A SCRIMMAGE HIGGLEDYPIGGLEDY. THE WALLS ARE TAPESTRIED
WITH A PAPER OF YEWFRONDS AND CLEAR GLADES. IN THE GRATE IS SPREAD A
SCREEN OF PEACOCK FEATHERS. LYNCH SQUATS CROSSLEGGED ON THE HEARTHRUG OF
MATTED HAIR, HIS CAP BACK TO THE FRONT. WITH A WAND HE BEATS TIME SLOWLY.
KITTY RICKETTS, A BONY PALLID WHORE IN NAVY COSTUME, DOESKIN GLOVES
ROLLED BACK FROM A CORAL WRISTLET, A CHAIN PURSE IN HER HAND, SITS
PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE SWINGING HER LEG AND GLANCING AT HERSELF
IN THE GILT MIRROR OVER THE MANTELPIECE. A TAG OF HER CORSETLACE HANGS
SLIGHTLY BELOW HER JACKET. LYNCH INDICATES MOCKINGLY THE COUPLE AT THE
PIANO.)
KITTY: (COUGHS BEHIND HER HAND) She’s a bit imbecillic. (SHE SIGNS WITH A
WAGGLING FOREFINGER) Blemblem. (LYNCH LIFTS UP HER SKIRT AND WHITE
PETTICOAT WITH HIS WAND SHE SETTLES THEM DOWN QUICKLY.) Respect yourself.
(SHE HICCUPS, THEN BENDS QUICKLY HER SAILOR HAT UNDER WHICH HER HAIR
GLOWS, RED WITH HENNA) O, excuse!
ZOE: More limelight, Charley. (SHE GOES TO THE CHANDELIER AND TURNS THE
GAS FULL COCK)
KITTY: (PEERS AT THE GASJET) What ails it tonight?
LYNCH: (DEEPLY) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.
ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.
(THE WAND IN LYNCH’S HAND FLASHES: A BRASS POKER. STEPHEN STANDS AT THE
PIANOLA ON WHICH SPRAWL HIS HAT AND ASHPLANT. WITH TWO FINGERS HE REPEATS

KITTY: (HICCUPS AGAIN WITH A KICK OF HER HORSED FOOT) O, excuse!
ZOE: (PROMPTLY) Your boy’s thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.
(KITTY RICKETTS BENDS HER HEAD. HER BOA UNCOILS, SLIDES, GLIDES OVER HER
SHOULDER, BACK, ARM, CHAIR TO THE GROUND. LYNCH LIFTS THE CURLED
CATERPILLAR ON HIS WAND. SHE SNAKES HER NECK, NESTLING. STEPHEN GLANCES
BEHIND AT THE SQUATTED FIGURE WITH ITS CAP BACK TO THE FRONT.)
STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet’s rest. It may be an
old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate COELA ENARRANT GLORIAM DOMINI. It
is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David’s
that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s tip from the
stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his almightiness.
MAIS NOM DE NOM, that is another pair of trousers. JETEZ LA GOURME. FAUT
QUE JEUNESSE SE PASSE. (HE STOPS, POINTS AT LYNCH’S CAP, SMILES, LAUGHS)
Which side is your knowledge bump?
THE CAP: (WITH SATURNINE SPLEEN) Bah! It is because it is. Woman’s
reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of
life. Bah!
STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.
How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!
THE CAP: Bah!
STEPHEN: Here’s another for you. (HE FROWNS) The reason is because the
fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible
interval which ...
THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can’t.
STEPHEN: (WITH AN EFFORT) Interval which. Is the greatest possible
ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.
THE CAP: Which?
(OUTSIDE THE GRAMOPHONE BEGINS TO BLARE The Holy City.)
STEPHEN: (ABRUPTLY) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse
not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having
itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait
a second. Damn that fellow’s noise in the street. Self which it itself
was ineluctably preconditioned to become. ECCO!
LYNCH: (WITH A MOCKING WHINNY OF LAUGHTER GRINS AT BLOOM AND ZOE HIGGINS)
What a learned speech, eh?
ZOE: (BRISKLY) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.
(with Obese Stupidity Florry Talbot Regards Stephen.)
FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.
KITTY: No!
ZOE: (EXPLODES IN LAUGHTER) Great unjust God!
FLORRY: (OFFENDED) Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O, my
foot’s tickling.
(ragged Barefoot Newsboys, Jogging a Wagtail Kite, Patter Past, Yelling.)

Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it’s up to you to
sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on
the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the
higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll.
Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that,
congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got
me? It’s a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It’s the
whole pie with jam in. It’s just the cutest snappiest line out. It is
immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some
vibrator. Joking apart and, getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie
and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O. K. Seventyseven west
sixtyninth street. Got me? That’s it. You call me up by sunphone any old
time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (HE SHOUTS) Now then our glory song.

ELIJAH: (IN ROLLEDUP SHIRTSLEEVES, BLACK IN THE FACE, SHOUTS AT THE TOP
OF HIS VOICE, HIS ARMS UPLIFTED) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you
hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe
strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and
Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don’t
never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry,
just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save
our sisters dear. (HE WINKS AT HIS AUDIENCE) Our Mr President, he twig
the whole lot and he aint saying nothing.
KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did
on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in the
brown scapular. My mother’s sister married a Montmorency. It was a
working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.
ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.
FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of
Hennessy’s three star. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the
bed.
STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end.

Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.
JOHN EGLINTON: (PRODUCES A GREENCAPPED DARK LANTERN AND FLASHES IT
TOWARDS A CORNER: WITH CARPING ACCENT) Esthetics and cosmetics are for
the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee
wants the facts and means to get them.

SLOWLY. A COLD SEAWIND BLOWS FROM HIS DRUID MOUTH. ABOUT HIS HEAD WRITHE
EELS AND ELVERS. HE IS ENCRUSTED WITH WEEDS AND SHELLS. HIS RIGHT HAND
HOLDS A BICYCLE PUMP. HIS LEFT HAND GRASPS A HUGE CRAYFISH BY ITS TWO
TALONS.)
MANANAUN MACLIR: (WITH A VOICE OF WAVES) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma!
White yoghin of the gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (WITH A
VOICE OF WHISTLING SEAWIND) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won’t have my leg
pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti.
(WITH A CRY OF STORMBIRDS) Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father! (HE SMITES
WITH HIS BICYCLE PUMP THE CRAYFISH IN HIS LEFT HAND. ON ITS COOPERATIVE
DIAL GLOW THE TWELVE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC. HE WAILS WITH THE VEHEMENCE OF
THE OCEAN.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead! I am the
dreamery creamery butter.

ZOE: Who has a fag as I’m here?
LYNCH: (TOSSING A CIGARETTE ON TO THE TABLE) Here.
ZOE: (HER HEAD PERCHED ASIDE IN MOCK PRIDE) Is that the way to hand the
POT to a lady? (SHE STRETCHES UP TO LIGHT THE CIGARETTE OVER THE FLAME,
TWIRLING IT SLOWLY, SHOWING THE BROWN TUFTS OF HER ARMPITS. LYNCH WITH
HIS POKER LIFTS BOLDLY A SIDE OF HER SLIP. BARE FROM HER GARTERS UP HER
FLESH APPEARS UNDER THE SAPPHIRE A NIXIE’S GREEN. SHE PUFFS CALMLY AT HER

GAZING IN THE MIRROR, SMOOTHS BOTH EYEBROWS. LIPOTI VIRAG,
BASILICOGRAMMATE, CHUTES RAPIDLY DOWN THROUGH THE CHIMNEYFLUE AND STRUTS

OVERCOATS AND WEARS A BROWN MACINTOSH UNDER WHICH HE HOLDS A ROLL OF

FITZMAURICE TISDALL FARRELL. ON HIS HEAD IS PERCHED AN EGYPTIAN PSHENT.
TWO QUILLS PROJECT OVER HIS EARS.)
VIRAG: (HEELS TOGETHER, BOWS) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely.
(HE COUGHS THOUGHTFULLY, DRILY) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence
hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is
not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular
devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.
BLOOM: Granpapachi. But ...
VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and
coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of
gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I
should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always
understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of
lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a
word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
BLOOM: She is rather lean.
VIRAG: (NOT UNPLEASANTLY) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier
pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest
bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull
has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the
attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you
can wear today. Parallax! (WITH A NERVOUS TWITCH OF HIS HEAD) Did you
hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
BLOOM: (AN ELBOW RESTING IN A HAND, A FOREFINGER AGAINST HIS CHEEK) She
seems sad.
VIRAG: (CYNICALLY, HIS WEASEL TEETH BARED YELLOW, DRAWS DOWN HIS LEFT EYE
WITH A FINGER AND BARKS HOARSELY) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus
mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor’s button discovered by
Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (MORE GENIALLY)
Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There
is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated
vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of
the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
BLOOM: (REGRETFULLY) When you come out without your gun.
VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money,
take your choice. How happy could you be with either ...
BLOOM: With ...?
VIRAG: (HIS TONGUE UPCURLING) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is
coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight
of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the
noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional
protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,
which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are
the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an
elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin
swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief
existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits
your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it.
Lycopodium. (HIS THROAT TWITCHES) Slapbang! There he goes again.
BLOOM: The stye I dislike.
VIRAG: (ARCHES HIS EYEBROWS) Contact with a goldring, they say.
ARGUMENTUM AD FEMINAM, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the
consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve’s sovereign
remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (HE TWITCHES) It is a funny
sound. (HE COUGHS ENCOURAGINGLY) But possibly it is only a wart. I
presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that
head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
BLOOM: (REFLECTING) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This
searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of
accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said ...
VIRAG: (SEVERELY, HIS NOSE HARDHUMPED, HIS SIDE EYE WINKING) Stop
twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.
Exercise your mnemotechnic. LA CAUSA E SANTA. Tara. Tara. (ASIDE) He will
surely remember.
BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over
parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand
cures. Mnemo?
VIRAG: (EXCITEDLY) I say so. I say so. E’en so. Technic. (HE TAPS HIS
PARCHMENTROLL ENERGETICALLY) This book tells you how to act with all
descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,
melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about
amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with
horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar
and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike
women in male habiliments? (WITH A DRY SNIGGER) You intended to devote an
entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months
of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the
sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or
stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those
complicated combinations, camiknickers? (HE CROWS DERISIVELY)
Keekeereekee!
(BLOOM SURVEYS UNCERTAINLY THE THREE WHORES THEN GAZES AT THE VEILED
MAUVE LIGHT, HEARING THE EVERFLYING MOTH.)
BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence
this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is
will then morrow as now was be past yester.
VIRAG: (PROMPTS IN A PIG’S WHISPER) Insects of the day spend their brief
existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly
pulchritudinous fumale possessing extendified pudendal nerve in dorsal
region. Pretty Poll! (HIS YELLOW PARROTBEAK GABBLES NASALLY) They had a
proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five
hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract
friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar.
Bear’s buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may
resume. We were very pleased, we others. (HE COUGHS AND, BENDING HIS
BROW, RUBS HIS NOSE THOUGHTFULLY WITH A SCOOPING HAND) You shall find
that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their
complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth
book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.B.
says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again
whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun.
Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! (he blows into Bloom’s
ear) Buzz!

Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (HE GOBBLES
GLUTTONOUSLY WITH TURKEY WATTLES) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we?
Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (HE UNROLLS HIS PARCHMENT RAPIDLY AND READS,
HIS GLOWWORM’S NOSE RUNNING BACKWARDS OVER THE LETTERS WHICH HE CLAWS)
Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will shortly
be upon us. I’m the best o’cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and
the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous
porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis.
Though they stink yet they sting. (HE WAGS HIS HEAD WITH CACKLING
RAILLERY) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. (HE SNEEZES) Amen!
BLOOM: (ABSENTLY) Ocularly woman’s bivalve case is worse. Always open
sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve
and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my
idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman’s milk. Wind their way through
miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those
bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.
VIRAG: (HIS MOUTH PROJECTED IN HARD WRINKLES, EYES STONILY FORLORNLY
CLOSED, PSALMS IN OUTLANDISH MONOTONE) That the cows with their those
distended udders that they have been the the known ...
BLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (HE REPEATS)
Spontaneously to seek out the saurian’s lair in order to entrust their
teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (PROFOUNDLY) Instinct rules
the world. In life. In death.
VIRAG: (HEAD ASKEW, ARCHES HIS BACK AND HUNCHED WINGSHOULDERS, PEERS AT
THE MOTH OUT OF BLEAR BULGED EYES, POINTS A HORNING CLAW AND CRIES) Who’s
moth moth? Who’s dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is Gerald.
O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon
not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass
tablenumpkin? (HE MEWS) Puss puss puss puss! (HE SIGHS, DRAWS BACK AND
STARES SIDEWAYS DOWN WITH DROPPING UNDERJAW) Well, well. He doth rest
anon. (he snaps his jaws suddenly on the air)
The Moth:
    I’m a tiny tiny thing
    Ever flying in the spring
    Round and round a ringaring.
    Long ago I was a king
    Now I do this kind of thing
    On the wing, on the wing!
    Bing!

pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my.
Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old
Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep
impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I’m partially
drunk, by the way. (HE TOUCHES THE KEYS AGAIN) Minor chord comes now.
Yes. Not much however.

MOUSTACHEWORK.)

LAWNMOWERS, APPEAR IN THE WINDOW EMBRASURE. BOTH ARE MASKED WITH MATTHEW
ARNOLD’S FACE.)
PHILIP SOBER: Take a fool’s advice. All is not well. Work it out with the
buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you
got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney’s en
ville, Mooney’s sur mer, the Moira, Larchet’s, Holles street hospital,
Burke’s. Eh? I am watching you.
PHILIP DRUNK: (IMPATIENTLY) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If
I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who
was it told me his name? (HIS LAWNMOWER BEGINS TO PURR) Aha, yes. ZOE MOU
SAS AGAPO. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his
card I have somewhere. Mac Somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about,
hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?
FLORRY: And the song?
STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? You’re like someone I knew once.
STEPHEN: Out of it now. (TO HIMSELF) Clever.
PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER: (THEIR LAWNMOWERS PURRING WITH A RIGADOON
OF GRASSHALMS) Clever ever. Out of it out of it. By the bye have you the
book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow.
Keep in condition. Do like us.
ZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of
business with his coat buttoned up. You needn’t try to hide, I says to
him. I know you’ve a Roman collar.
VIRAG: Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (HARSHLY, HIS
PUPILS WAXING) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the
Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why I left the
church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose.
Flipperty Jippert. (HE WRIGGLES) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt
of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man’s lingam. Short time after
man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers
herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam,
the stiff one. (HE CRIES) COACTUS VOLUI. Then giddy woman will run about.
Strong man grapses woman’s wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now
fierce angry, strikes woman’s fat yadgana. (HE CHASES HIS TAIL) Piffpaff!
Popo! (HE STOPS, SNEEZES) Pchp! (HE WORRIES HIS BUTT) Prrrrrht!
LYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for
shooting a bishop.
ZOE: (SPOUTS WALRUS SMOKE THROUGH HER NOSTRILS) He couldn’t get a
connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

pope’s bastard. (HE LEANS OUT ON TORTURED FOREPAWS, ELBOWS BENT RIGID,

son of a whore. Apocalypse.

Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn’t swallow
and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all
subscribed for the funeral.

UNGAINLY STILTHOPS, HIS TAIL COCKED, AND DEFTLY CLAPS SIDEWAYS ON THE
WALL A PUSYELLOW FLYBILL, BUTTING IT WITH HIS HEAD.)
THE FLYBILL: K. II. Post No Bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.
HENRY: All is lost now.

VIRAG’S HEAD: Quack!
(EXEUNT SEVERALLY.)
STEPHEN: (OVER HIS SHOULDER TO ZOE) You would have preferred the fighting
parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog
sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.
LYNCH: All one and the same God to her.
STEPHEN: (DEVOUTLY) And sovereign Lord of all things.
FLORRY: (TO STEPHEN) I’m sure you’re a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

THUMBS ARE STUCK IN HIS ARMPITS AND HIS PALMS OUTSPREAD. ROUND HIS NECK
HANGS A ROSARY OF CORKS ENDING ON HIS BREAST IN A CORKSCREW CROSS.

GESTURES AND PROCLAIMS WITH BLOATED POMP:)
The Cardinal:
    Conservio lies captured
    He lies in the lowest dungeon
    With manacles and chains around his limbs
    Weighing upwards of three tons.

walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

BREAKS OFF AND NIBBLES A PIECE GIVES A PIECE TO KITTY RICKETTS AND THEN

ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady.
The gas we had on the Toft’s hobbyhorses. I’m giddy still.
BLOOM: (IN SVENGALI’S FUR OVERCOAT, WITH FOLDED ARMS AND NAPOLEONIC
FORELOCK, FROWNS IN VENTRILOQUIAL EXORCISM WITH PIERCING EAGLE GLANCE
TOWARDS THE DOOR. THEN RIGID WITH LEFT FOOT ADVANCED HE MAKES A SWIFT
PASS WITH IMPELLING FINGERS AND GIVES THE SIGN OF PAST MASTER, DRAWING
HIS RIGHT ARM DOWNWARDS FROM HIS LEFT SHOULDER.) Go, go, go, I conjure
you, whoever you are!
(A MALE COUGH AND TREAD ARE HEARD PASSING THROUGH THE MIST OUTSIDE.
BLOOM’S FEATURES RELAX. HE PLACES A HAND IN HIS WAISTCOAT, POSING CALMLY.
ZOE OFFERS HIM CHOCOLATE.)
BLOOM: (SOLEMNLY) Thanks.
ZOE: Do as you’re bid. Here!
(a Firm Heelclacking Tread Is Heard On the Stairs.)
BLOOM: (TAKES THE CHOCOLATE) Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But I
bought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red
influences lupus. Colours affect women’s characters, any they have. This
black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (HE EATS) Influence
taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That
priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.
(THE DOOR OPENS. BELLA COHEN, A MASSIVE WHOREMISTRESS, ENTERS. SHE IS
DRESSED IN A THREEQUARTER IVORY GOWN, FRINGED ROUND THE HEM WITH
TASSELLED SELVEDGE, AND COOLS HERSELF FLIRTING A BLACK HORN FAN LIKE
MINNIE HAUCK IN Carmen. ON HER LEFT HAND ARE WEDDING AND KEEPER RINGS.
HER EYES ARE DEEPLY CARBONED. SHE HAS A SPROUTING MOUSTACHE. HER OLIVE
FACE IS HEAVY, SLIGHTLY SWEATED AND FULLNOSED WITH ORANGETAINTED
NOSTRILS. SHE HAS LARGE PENDANT BERYL EARDROPS.)
BELLA: My word! I’m all of a mucksweat.
(SHE GLANCES ROUND HER AT THE COUPLES. THEN HER EYES REST ON BLOOM WITH
HARD INSISTENCE. HER LARGE FAN WINNOWS WIND TOWARDS HER HEATED FACENECK
AND EMBONPOINT. HER FALCON EYES GLITTER.)
THE FAN: (FLIRTING QUICKLY, THEN SLOWLY) Married, I see.
BLOOM: Yes. Partly, I have mislaid ...
THE FAN: (HALF OPENING, THEN CLOSING) And the missus is master. Petticoat
government.
BLOOM: (LOOKS DOWN WITH A SHEEPISH GRIN) That is so.
THE FAN: (FOLDING TOGETHER, RESTS AGAINST HER LEFT EARDROP) Have you
forgotten me?
BLOOM: Yes. Yo.
THE FAN: (FOLDED AKIMBO AGAINST HER WAIST) Is me her was you dreamed
before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now
we?
(bella Approaches, Gently Tapping With the Fan.)
BLOOM: (WINCING) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women
love.
THE FAN: (TAPPING) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
BLOOM: (COWED) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination.
I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an
unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box
of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a
right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the
law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in
my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower,
was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of
tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David
and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A
dog’s spittle as you probably ... (HE WINCES) Ah!
RICHIE GOULDING: (BAGWEIGHTED, PASSES THE DOOR) Mocking is catch. Best
value in Dub. Fit for a prince’s. Liver and kidney.
THE FAN: (TAPPING) All things end. Be mine. Now,
BLOOM: (UNDECIDED) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman.
Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of
life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
THE FAN: (POINTS DOWNWARDS SLOWLY) You may.
BLOOM: (LOOKS DOWNWARDS AND PERCEIVES HER UNFASTENED BOOTLACE) We are
observed.
THE FAN: (POINTS DOWNWARDS QUICKLY) You must.
BLOOM: (WITH DESIRE, WITH RELUCTANCE) I can make a true black knot.
Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
Kellett’s. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.
I knelt once before today. Ah!
(BELLA RAISES HER GOWN SLIGHTLY AND, STEADYING HER POSE, LIFTS TO THE
EDGE OF A CHAIR A PLUMP BUSKINED HOOF AND A FULL PASTERN, SILKSOCKED.
BLOOM, STIFFLEGGED, AGING, BENDS OVER HER HOOF AND WITH GENTLE FINGERS
DRAWS OUT AND IN HER LACES.)
BLOOM: (MURMURS LOVINGLY) To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my love’s
young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up
crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model
Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
toe, as worn in Paris.
THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
BLOOM: (CROSSLACING) Too tight?
THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you.
BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her ... person you mentioned.
That night she met ... Now!
(HE KNOTS THE LACE. BELLA PLACES HER FOOT ON THE FLOOR. BLOOM RAISES HIS
HEAD. HER HEAVY FACE, HER EYES STRIKE HIM IN MIDBROW. HIS EYES GROW DULL,
DARKER AND POUCHED, HIS NOSE THICKENS.)
BLOOM: (MUMBLES) Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen, ...
BELLO: (WITH A HARD BASILISK STARE, IN A BARITONE VOICE) Hound of
dishonour!
BLOOM: (INFATUATED) Empress!
BELLO: (HIS HEAVY CHEEKCHOPS SAGGING) Adorer of the adulterous rump!
BLOOM: (PLAINTIVELY) Hugeness!
BELLO: Dungdevourer!
BLOOM: (WITH SINEWS SEMIFLEXED) Magmagnificence!
BELLO: Down! (HE TAPS HER ON THE SHOULDER WITH HIS FAN) Incline feet
forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling.
On the hands down!

Truffles!
(WITH A PIERCING EPILEPTIC CRY SHE SINKS ON ALL FOURS, GRUNTING,

EXCELLENT MASTER.)

BREECHES POCKETS, PLACES HIS HEEL ON HER NECK AND GRINDS IT IN)
Footstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of
your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.
BLOOM: (ENTHRALLED, BLEATS) I promise never to disobey.
BELLO: (LAUGHS LOUDLY) Holy smoke! You little know what’s in store for
you. I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I’ll bet
Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I
dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be
inflicted in gym costume.
(bloom Creeps Under the Sofa and Peers Out Through the Fringe.)
ZOE: (WIDENING HER SLIP TO SCREEN HER) She’s not here.
BLOOM: (CLOSING HER EYES) She’s not here.
FLORRY: (HIDING HER WITH HER GOWN) She didn’t mean it, Mr Bello. She’ll
be good, sir.
KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won’t, ma’amsir.
BELLO: (COAXINGLY) Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you, darling,
just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety.
(BLOOM PUTS OUT HER TIMID HEAD) There’s a good girly now. (BELLO GRABS
HER HAIR VIOLENTLY AND DRAGS HER FORWARD) I only want to correct you for
your own good on a soft safe spot. How’s that tender behind? O, ever so
gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
BLOOM: (FAINTING) Don’t tear my ...
BELLO: (SAVAGELY) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging
hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian
slave of old. You’re in for it this time! I’ll make you remember me for
the balance of your natural life. (HIS FOREHEAD VEINS SWOLLEN, HIS FACE
CONGESTED) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my
thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat hamrashers and a bottle of
Guinness’s porter. (HE BELCHES) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange
cigar while I read the LICENSED VICTUALLER’S GAZETTE. Very possibly I
shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice
of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like
sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you. (HE
TWISTS HER ARM. BLOOM SQUEALS, TURNING TURTLE.)
BLOOM: Don’t be cruel, nurse! Don’t!
BELLO: (TWISTING) Another!
BLOOM: (SCREAMS) O, it’s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like
mad!
BELLO: (SHOUTS) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That’s the best bit
of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don’t keep me waiting, damn you!
(HE SLAPS HER FACE)
BLOOM: (WHIMPERS) You’re after hitting me. I’ll tell ...
BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

MRS KEOGH: (FEROCIOUSLY) Can I help? (THEY HOLD AND PINION BLOOM.)
BELLO: (SQUATS WITH A GRUNT ON BLOOM’S UPTURNED FACE, PUFFING CIGARSMOKE,
NURSING A FAT LEG) I see Keating Clay is elected vicechairman of the
Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness’s preference shares are at sixteen
three quaffers. Curse me for a fool that didn’t buy that lot Craig and
Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that
Goddamned outsider THROWAWAY at twenty to one. (HE QUENCHES HIS CIGAR
ANGRILY ON BLOOM’S EAR) Where’s that Goddamned cursed ashtray?
BLOOM: (GOADED, BUTTOCKSMOTHERED) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never
prayed before. (HE THRUSTS OUT A FIGGED FIST AND FOUL CIGAR) Here, kiss
that. Both. Kiss. (HE THROWS A LEG ASTRIDE AND, PRESSING WITH HORSEMAN’S
KNEES, CALLS IN A HARD VOICE) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I’ll
ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (HE BENDS SIDEWAYS AND SQUEEZES HIS
MOUNT’S TESTICLES ROUGHLY, SHOUTING) Ho! Off we pop! I’ll nurse you in
proper fashion. (HE HORSERIDES COCKHORSE, LEAPING IN THE SADDLE) The lady
goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman
goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.
FLORRY: (PULLS AT BELLO) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked
before you.
ZOE: (PULLING AT FLORRY) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet,
suckeress?
BLOOM: (STIFLING) Can’t.
BELLO: Well, I’m not. Wait. (HE HOLDS IN HIS BREATH) Curse it. Here. This
bung’s about burst. (HE UNCORKS HIMSELF BEHIND: THEN, CONTORTING HIS
FEATURES, FARTS LOUDLY) Take that! (HE RECORKS HIMSELF) Yes, by Jingo,
sixteen three quarters.
BLOOM: (A SWEAT BREAKING OUT OVER HIM) Not man. (HE SNIFFS) Woman.
BELLO: (STANDS UP) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has
come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing
under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male
garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously
rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!
BLOOM: (SHRINKS) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tiptouch
it with my nails?
BELLO: (POINTS TO HIS WHORES) As they are now so will you be, wigged,
singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape
measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel
force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to
the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure,
plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty
two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my
houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for
Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little
chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of
lace round your bare knees will remind you ...
BLOOM: (A CHARMING SOUBRETTE WITH DAUBY CHEEKS, MUSTARD HAIR AND LARGE
MALE HANDS AND NOSE, LEERING MOUTH) I tried her things on only twice, a
small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to save
the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.
BELLO: (JEERS) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed off
coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds your
unskirted thighs and hegoat’s udders in various poses of surrender, eh?
Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short
trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs
Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?
BLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.
BELLO: (GUFFAWS) Christ Almighty it’s too tickling, this! You were a
nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay
swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be violated
by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M. P., signor
Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henri Fleury
of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus, the varsity
wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs,
dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (HE GUFFAWS AGAIN) Christ, wouldn’t it
make a Siamese cat laugh?
BLOOM: (HER HANDS AND FEATURES WORKING) It was Gerald converted me to be
a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play
VICE VERSA. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister’s
stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids.
Cult of the beautiful.
BELLO: (WITH WICKED GLEE) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took
your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the
smoothworn throne.
BLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (EARNESTLY)
And really it’s better the position ... because often I used to wet ...
BELLO: (STERNLY) No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the corner
for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I? Do it standing, sir!
I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your
swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you’ll find I’m a martinet. The
sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
THE SINS OF THE PAST: (IN A MEDLEY OF VOICES) He went through a form of
clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black
church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an
address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the
instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly encouraged a
nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary
outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote
pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered
males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass
night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how
much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a
nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty
harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?
BELLO: (WHISTLES LOUDLY) Say! What was the most revolting piece of
obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out! Be
candid for once.

the half of the ... I swear on my sacred oath ...
BELLO: (PEREMPTORILY) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell
me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a line of
poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give
you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr ...

BELLO: (IMPERIOUSLY) O, get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when
you’re spoken to.
BLOOM: (BOWS) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
(he Lifts His Arms. His Bangle Bracelets Fill.)
BELLO: (SATIRICALLY) By day you will souse and bat our smelling
underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines
with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won’t that be
nice? (HE PLACES A RUBY RING ON HER FINGER) And there now! With this ring
I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.
BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in
the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one.
Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.
Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I’ll lecture you
on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,
with the hairbrush. You’ll be taught the error of your ways. At night
your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves
newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such
favours knights of old laid down their lives. (HE CHUCKLES) My boys will
be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when
they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction
in gilded heels. First I’ll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the
turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and
another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the
lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile.
Droop shoulders. What offers? (HE POINTS) For that lot. Trained by owner
to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (HE BARES HIS ARM AND PLUNGES IT
ELBOWDEEP IN BLOOM’S VULVA) There’s fine depth for you! What, boys? That
give you a hardon? (HE SHOVES HIS ARM IN A BIDDER’S FACE) Here wet the
deck and wipe it round!
A BIDDER: A florin.
(dillon’s Lacquey Rings His Handbell.)
THE LACQUEY: Barang!
A VOICE: One and eightpence too much.
CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
BELLO: (GIVES A RAP WITH HIS GAVEL) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap
at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle
him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had
only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons
a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His sire’s milk
record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa my
jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (HE BRANDS HIS INITIAL C ON BLOOM’S CROUP) So!
Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
A DARKVISAGED MAN: (IN DISGUISED ACCENT) Hoondert punt sterlink.
VOICES: (SUBDUED) For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.
BELLO: (GAILY) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short
skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a
potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long
straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts
of the BLASE man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch
Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs
fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of fascination
to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.
BLOOM: (BENDS HIS BLUSHING FACE INTO HIS ARMPIT AND SIMPERS WITH
FOREFINGER IN MOUTH) O, I know what you’re hinting at now!
BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (HE STOOPS
AND, PEERING, POKES WITH HIS FAN RUDELY UNDER THE FAT SUET FOLDS OF
BLOOM’S HAUNCHES) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where’s your curly
teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing.
It’s as limp as a boy of six’s doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a
bucket or sell your pump. (LOUDLY) Can you do a man’s job?
BLOOM: Eccles street ...
BELLO: (SARCASTICALLY) I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world but
there’s a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay
young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you,
you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over
it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly
to belly, bubs to breast! He’s no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has
sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my
lad! Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in her guts
already! That makes you wild, don’t it? Touches the spot? (HE SPITS IN
CONTEMPT) Spittoon!
BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I ... Inform the police. Hundred pounds.
Unmentionable. I ...
BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your
drizzle.
BLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll ... We ... Still
...
BELLO: (RUTHLESSLY) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman’s will
since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years.
Return and see.
(old Sleepy Hollow Calls Over the Wold.)
SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Rip van Winkle!
BLOOM: (IN TATTERED MOCASSINS WITH A RUSTY FOWLINGPIECE, TIPTOEING,
FINGERTIPPING, HIS HAGGARD BONY BEARDED FACE PEERING THROUGH THE DIAMOND
PANES, CRIES OUT) I see her! It’s she! The first night at Mat Dillon’s!
But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he ...

student.

MILLY: My! It’s Papli! But, O Papli, how old you’ve grown!
BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,
aunt Hegarty’s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and
his menfriends are living there in clover. The CUCKOOS’ REST! Why not?
How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot,
exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute?
Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the
goose, my gander O.
BLOOM: They ... I ...
BELLO: (CUTTINGLY) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you
bought at Wren’s auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find
the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you
carried home in the rain for art for art’ sake. They will violate the
secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of
astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten
shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom’s.
BLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return.
I will prove ...
A VOICE: Swear!
(BLOOM CLENCHES HIS FISTS AND CRAWLS FORWARD, A BOWIEKNIFE BETWEEN HIS
TEETH.)
BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your
secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You
are down and out and don’t you forget it, old bean.
BLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody ...? (HE BITES HIS
THUMB)
BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace
about you. I can give you a rare old wine that’ll send you skipping to
hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have! If you have
none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We’ll bury you in our
shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my
stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a
crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, whatever the
buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. (HE EXPLODES IN A
LOUD PHLEGMY LAUGH) We’ll manure you, Mr Flower! (HE PIPES SCOFFINGLY)

WITH DIGNITY) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of
habit.
THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in
fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt
of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to
disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads,
proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured
gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
BLOOM: (LIFTS A TURTLE HEAD TOWARDS HER LAP) We have met before. On
another star.
THE NYMPH: (SADLY) Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the
aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited
testimonials for Professor Waldmann’s wonderful chest exuber. My bust
developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.
BLOOM: You mean PHOTO BITS?
THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four
places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.
BLOOM: (HUMBLY KISSES HER LONG HAIR) Your classic curves, beautiful
immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,
almost to pray.
THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.
BLOOM: (QUICKLY) Yes, yes. You mean that I ... Sleep reveals the worst
side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of bed or
rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there
is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago,
incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive vent.
(HE SIGHS) ’Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.
THE NYMPH: (HER FINGERS IN HER EARS) And words. They are not in my
dictionary.
BLOOM: You understood them?
THE YEWS: Ssh!
THE NYMPH: (COVERS HER FACE WITH HER HANDS) What have I not seen in that
chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
BLOOM: (APOLOGETICALLY) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with
care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.
THE NYMPH: (BENDS HER HEAD) Worse, worse!
BLOOM: (REFLECTS PRECAUTIOUSLY) That antiquated commode. It wasn’t her

THE WATERFALL:
    Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
    Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
THE YEWS: (MINGLING THEIR BOUGHS) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our

BLOOM: (SCARED) High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession of
faculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.
THE ECHO: Sham!
BLOOM: (PIGEONBREASTED, BOTTLESHOULDERED, PADDED, IN NONDESCRIPT JUVENILE
GREY AND BLACK STRIPED SUIT, TOO SMALL FOR HIM, WHITE TENNIS SHOES,
BORDERED STOCKINGS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND A RED SCHOOLCAP WITH BADGE) I

the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory, the throng
