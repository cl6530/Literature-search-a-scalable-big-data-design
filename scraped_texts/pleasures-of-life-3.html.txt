    “All places that the eye of Heaven visits
    Are to the wise man ports and happy havens.”
    SHAKESPEARE.
    “Some murmur, when their sky is clear
      And wholly bright to view,
    If one small speck of dark appear
      In their great heaven of blue.
    And some with thankful love are fill’d
      If but one streak of light,
    One ray of God’s good mercy gild
      The darkness of their night.

    “In palaces are hearts that ask,
      In discontent and pride,
    Why life is such a dreary task,
      And all good things denied.
    And hearts in poorest huts admire
      How love has in their aid
    (Love that not ever seems to tire)
      Such rich provision made.”
    TRENCH.
