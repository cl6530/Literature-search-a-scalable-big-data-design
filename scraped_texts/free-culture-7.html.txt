If piracy means using the creative property of others without their 
permissionif if value, then right is truethen the history of the content 
industry is a history of piracy. Every important sector of big media today
film, records, radio, and cable TVwas born of a kind of piracy so defined. The 
consistent story is how last generation’s pirates join this generation’s country 
clubuntil now.
Film
The film industry of Hollywood was built by fleeing pirates. [1] Creators and 
directors migrated from the East Coast to California in the early twentieth 
century in part to escape controls that patents granted the inventor of 
filmmaking, Thomas Edison. These controls were exercised through a monopoly 
trust, the Motion Pictures Patents Company, and were based on Thomas Edison’s 
creative propertypatents. Edison formed the MPPC to exercise the rights this 
creative property gave him, and the MPPC was serious about the control it 
demanded. As one commentator tells one part of the story,
A January 1909 deadline was set for all companies to comply with the license. 
By February, unlicensed outlaws, who referred to themselves as independents 
protested the trust and carried on business without submitting to the Edison 
monopoly. In the summer of 1909 the independent movement was in full-swing, with 
producers and theater owners using illegal equipment and imported film stock to 
create their own underground market.
With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion in the number of 
nickelodeons, the Patents Company reacted to the independent movement by forming 
a strong-arm subsidiary known as the General Film Company to block the entry of 
non-licensed independents. With coercive tactics that have become legendary, 
General Film confiscated unlicensed equipment, discontinued product supply to 
theaters which showed unlicensed films, and effectively monopolized distribution 
with the acquisition of all U.S. film exchanges, except for the one owned by the 
independent William Fox who defied the Trust even after his license was 
revoked. [2]
The Napsters of those days, the independents, were companies like Fox. And no 
less than today, these independents were vigorously resisted. Shooting was 
disrupted by machinery stolen, and ’accidents’ resulting in loss of negatives, 
equipment, buildings and sometimes life and limb frequently occurred. [3] That 
led the independents to flee the East Coast. California was remote enough from 
Edison’s reach that film- makers there could pirate his inventions without fear 
of the law. And the leaders of Hollywood filmmaking, Fox most prominently, did 
just that.
Of course, California grew quickly, and the effective enforcement of federal law 
eventually spread west. But because patents grant the patent holder a truly 
limited monopoly (just seventeen years at that time), by the time enough 
federal marshals appeared, the patents had expired. A new industry had been 
born, in part from the piracy of Edison’s creative property.
Recorded Music
The record industry was born of another kind of piracy, though to see how 
requires a bit of detail about the way the law regulates music.
At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines for reproducing 
music (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player piano), the law gave 
composers the exclusive right to control copies of their music and the exclusive 
right to control public performances of their music. In other words, in 1900, if 
I wanted a copy of Phil Russel’s 1899 hit Happy Mose, the law said I would 
have to pay for the right to get a copy of the musical score, and I would also 
have to pay for the right to perform it publicly.
But what if I wanted to record Happy Mose, using Edison’s phonograph or 
Fourneaux’s player piano? Here the law stumbled. It was clear enough that I 
would have to buy any copy of the musical score that I performed in making this 
recording. And it was clear enough that I would have to pay for any public 
performance of the work I was recording. But it wasn’t totally clear that I 
would have to pay for a public performance if I recorded the song in my own 
house (even today, you don’t owe the Beatles anything if you sing their songs in 
the shower), or if I recorded the song from memory (copies in your brain are 
notyet regulated by copyright law). So if I simply sang the song into a 
recording device in the privacy of my own home, it wasn’t clear that I owed the 
composer anything. And more importantly, it wasn’t clear whether I owed the 
composer anything if I then made copies of those recordings. Because of this gap 
in the law, then, I could effectively pirate someone else’s song without paying 
its composer anything.
The composers (and publishers) were none too happy about this capacity to 
pirate. As South Dakota senator Alfred Kittredge put it,
Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or an opera. A 
publisher buys at great expense the rights to the same and copyrights it. Along 
come the phonographic companies and companies who cut music rolls and 
deliberately steal the work of the brain of the composer and publisher without 
any regard for [their] rights. [4]
The innovators who developed the technology to record other people’s works were 
sponging upon the toil, the work, the talent, and genius of American 
composers, [5] and the music publishing industry” was thereby at the complete 
mercy of this one pirate. [6] As John Philip Sousa put it, in as direct a way 
as possible, When they make money out of my pieces, I want a share of it. [7]
These arguments have familiar echoes in the wars of our day. So, too, do the 
arguments on the other side. The innovators who developed the player piano 
argued that it is perfectly demonstrable that the introduction of automatic 
music players has not deprived any composer of anything he had before their 
introduction. Rather, the machines increased the sales of sheet music. [8] In 
any case, the innovators argued, the job of Congress was to consider first the 
interest of [the public], whom they represent, and whose servants they are. 
All talk about ’theft,’ the general counsel of the American Graphophone 
Company wrote, is the merest claptrap, for there exists no property in ideas 
musical, literary or artistic, except as defined by statute. [9]
The law soon resolved this battle in favor of the composer and the recording 
artist. Congress amended the law to make sure that composers would be paid for 
the mechanical reproductions of their music. But rather than simply granting 
the composer complete control over the right to make mechanical reproductions, 
Congress gave recording artists a right to record the music, at a price set by 
Congress, once the composer allowed it to be recorded once. This is the part of 
copyright law that makes cover songs possible. Once a composer authorizes a 
recording of his song, others are free to record the same song, so long as they 
pay the original composer a fee set by the law.
American law ordinarily calls this a compulsory license, but I will refer to 
it as a statutory license. A statutory license is a license whose key terms 
are set by law. After Congress’s amendment of the Copyright Act in 1909, record 
companies were free to distribute copies of recordings so long as they paid the 
composer (or copyright holder) the fee set by the statute.
This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John Grisham writes a 
novel, a publisher is free to publish that novel only if Grisham gives the 
publisher permission. Grisham, in turn, is free to charge whatever he wants for 
that permission. The price to publish Grisham is thus set by Grisham, and 
copyright law ordinarily says you have no permission to use Grisham’s work 
except with permission of Grisham.
But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less. And thus, in 
effect, the law subsidizes the recording industry through a kind of piracyby 
giving recording artists a weaker right than it otherwise gives creative 
authors. The Beatles have less control over their creative work than Grisham 
does. And the beneficiaries of this less control are the recording industry and 
the public. The recording industry gets something of value for less than it 
otherwise would pay; the public gets access to a much wider range of musical 
creativity. Indeed, Congress was quite explicit about its reasons for granting 
this right. Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that 
power would stifle follow-on creativity. [10]
While the recording industry has been quite coy about this recently, 
historically it has been quite a supporter of the statutory license for records. 
As a 1967 report from the House Committee on the Judiciary relates,
the record producers argued vigorously that the compulsory license system must 
be retained. They asserted that the record industry is a half-billion-dollar 
business of great economic importance in the United States and throughout the 
world; records today are the principal means of disseminating music, and this 
creates special problems, since performers need unhampered access to musical 
material on nondiscriminatory terms. Historically, the record producers pointed 
out, there were no recording rights before 1909 and the 1909 statute adopted the 
compulsory license as a deliberate anti-monopoly condition on the grant of these 
rights. They argue that the result has been an outpouring of recorded music, 
with the public being given lower prices, improved quality, and a greater 
choice. [11]
By limiting the rights musicians have, by partially pirating their creative 
work, the record producers, and the public, benefit.
Radio
Radio was also born of piracy.
When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes a public 
performance of the composer’s work. [12] As I described above, the law gives 
the composer (or copyright holder) an exclusive right to public performances of 
his work. The radio station thus owes the composer money for that performance.
But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only performing a copy of 
the composer’s work. The radio station is also performing a copy of the 
/recording artist’s work. It’s one thing to have Happy Birthday sung on the 
radio by the local children’s choir; it’s quite another to have it sung by the 
Rolling Stones or Lyle Lovett. The recording artist is adding to the value of 
the composition performed on the radio station. And if the law were perfectly 
consistent, the radio station would have to pay the recording artist for his 
work, just as it pays the composer of the music for his work.
But it doesn’t. Under the law governing radio performances, the radio station 
does not have to pay the recording artist. The radio station need only pay the 
composer. The radio station thus gets a bit of something for nothing. It gets to 
perform the recording artist’s work for free, even if it must pay the composer 
something for the privilege of playing the song.
This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of music. Imagine it is 
your first. You own the exclusive right to authorize public performances of that 
music. So if Madonna wants to sing your song in public, she has to get your 
permission.
Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot. She then 
decides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a top hit. Under our 
law, every time a radio station plays your song, you get some money. But Madonna 
gets nothing, save the indirect effect on the sale of her CDs. The public 
performance of her recording is not a protected right. The radio station thus 
gets to pirate the value of Madonna’s work without paying her anything.
No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording artists benefit. On 
average, the promotion they get is worth more than the performance rights they 
give up. Maybe. But even if so, the law ordinarily gives the creator the right 
to make this choice. By making the choice for him or her, the law gives the 
radio station the right to take something for nothing.
Cable TV
Cable TV was also born of a kind of piracy.
When cable entrepreneurs first started wiring communities with cable television 
in 1948, most refused to pay broadcasters for the content that they echoed to 
their customers. Even when the cable companies started selling access to 
television broadcasts, they refused to pay for what they sold. Cable companies 
were thus Napsterizing broadcasters’ content, but more egregiously than anything 
Napster ever didNapster never charged for the content it enabled others to give 
away.
Broadcasters and copyright owners were quick to attack this theft. Rosel Hyde, 
chairman of the FCC, viewed the practice as a kind of unfair and potentially 
destructive competition. [13] There may have been a public interest in 
spreading the reach of cable TV, but as Douglas Anello, general counsel to the 
National Association of Broadcasters, asked Senator Quentin Burdick during 
testimony, Does public interest dictate that you use somebody else’s property? 
[14] As another broadcaster put it,
The extraordinary thing about the CATV business is that it is the only business 
I know of where the product that is being sold is not paid for. [15]
Again, the demand of the copyright holders seemed reasonable enough:
All we are asking for is a very simple thing, that people who now take our 
property for nothing pay for it. We are trying to stop piracy and I don’t think 
there is any lesser word to describe it. I think there are harsher words which 
would fit it. [16]
These were free-ride[rs], Screen Actor’s Guild president Charlton Heston said, 
who were depriving actors of compensation. [17]
But again, there was another side to the debate. As Assistant Attorney General 
Edwin Zimmerman put it,
Our point here is that unlike the problem of whether you have any copyright 
protection at all, the problem here is whether copyright holders who are already 
compensated, who already have a monopoly, should be permitted to extend that 
monopoly. ... The question here is how much compensation they should have and 
how far back they should carry their right to compensation. [18]
Copyright owners took the cable companies to court. Twice the Supreme Court held 
that the cable companies owed the copyright owners nothing.
It took Congress almost thirty years before it resolved the question of whether 
cable companies had to pay for the content they pirated. In the end, Congress 
resolved this question in the same way that it resolved the question about 
record players and player pianos. Yes, cable companies would have to pay for the 
content that they broadcast; but the price they would have to pay was not set by 
the copyright owner. The price was set by law, so that the broadcasters couldn’t 
exercise veto power over the emerging technologies of cable. Cable companies 
thus built their empire in part upon a piracy of the value created by 
broadcasters’ content.
These separate stories sing a common theme. If piracy means using value from 
someone else’s creative property without permission from that creatoras it is 
increasingly described today [19]then every industry affected by copyright 
today is the product and beneficiary of a certain kind of piracy. Film, records, 
radio, cable TV. ... The list is long and could well be expanded. Every 
generation welcomes the pirates from the last. Every generationuntil now.
