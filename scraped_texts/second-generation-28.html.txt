On the green oval within and opposite the entrance to the main campus of
the great university there is the colossal statue of a master workman.
The sculptor has done well. He does not merely show you the physical
man–the mass, the strength, of bone and sinew and muscle; he reveals the
man within–the big, courageous soul. Strangers often think this statue a
personation of the force which in a few brief generations has erected
from a wilderness our vast and splendid America. And it is that; but to
Arthur and Adelaide, standing before it in a June twilight, long after
the events above chronicled, it is their father–Hiram.
“How alive he seems,” says his daughter.
And his son answers: “How alive he is!”
