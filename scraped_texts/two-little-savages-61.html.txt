The New War Chief
Caleb had been very busy all the day before doing no one knew what,
and Saryann was busy, too. She had been very busy for long, but now
she was bustling. Then, it seems, Caleb had gone to Mrs. Raften, and
she was very busy, and Guy made a flying visit to Mrs. Burns, and
she had become busy. Thus they turned the whole neighbourhood into a
“bee.”
For this was Sanger, where small gatherings held the same place as the
club, theatre and newspaper do in the lives of city folk. No matter
what the occasion, a christening, wedding or funeral, a logging, a
threshing, a home-coming or a parting, the finishing of a new house
or the buying of a new harness or fanning-mill, any one of these was
ample grounds for one of their “talking bees"; so it was easy to set
the wheels a-running.
At three o’clock three processions might have been seen wending
through the woods. One was from Burns’s, including the whole family;
one from Raften’s, comprising the family and the hired men; one from
Caleb’s, made up of Saryann and many of the Boyles. All brought
baskets.
They were seated in a circle on the pleasant grassy bank of the
pond. Caleb and Sam took charge of the ceremonies. First, there were
foot-races, in which Yan won in spite of his wounded arm, the city boy
making a good second; then target-shooting and “Deer-hunting,” that
Yan could not take part in. It was not in the programme, but Raften
insisted on seeing Yan measure the height of a knot in a tree without
going to it, and grinned with delight when he found it was accurate.
“Luk at that for eddication, Sam!” he roared. “When will ye be able to
do the like? Arrah, but ye’re good stuff, Yan, an’ I’ve got something
here’ll plase ye.”
Raften now pulled out his purse and as magistrate paid over with
evident joy the $5 bounty due for killing the Lynx. Then he added:
“An’ if it turns out as ye all claim” [and it did] “that this yer
beast is the Sheep-killer instid av old Turk, I’ll add that other
tin.”
Thus Yan came into the largest sum be had ever owned in his life.
Then the Indians went into their teepees. Caleb set up a stake in the
ground and on that a new shield of wood covered with rawhide; over the
rawhide was lightly fastened a piece of sacking.
The guests were in a circle around this; at one side were some
skins–Yan’s Lynx and Coon–and the two stuffed Owls.
Then the drum was heard, “Túm-tum–túm-tum–túm-tum–túm-tum––"
There was a volley of war-whoops, and out of the teepees dashed the
Sanger Indians in full war paint.
  “Ki ki–ki yi–ki yi yi yi
  Ki yi–ki yi–ki yi yi yi!”
They danced in exact time to the two-measure of the drum that was
pounded by Blackhawk. Three times round the central post with the
shield they danced, then the drum stopped, and they joined in a grand
final war-whoop and squatted in a circle within that of the guests.
The Great Woodpecker now arose–his mother had to be told who it
was–and made a characteristic speech:
“Big Chiefs, Little Chiefs, and Squapooses of the Sanger Indians: A
number of things has happened to rob this yer nation of its noble Head
Chief; they kin never again expect to have his equal, but this yer
assembly is for to pick out a new one. We had a kind of whack at it
the other day, but couldn’t agree. Since then we had a hard trip, and
things has cleared up some, same as puttin’ Kittens in a pond will
tell which one is the swimmer, an’ we’re here to-day to settle it.”
Loud cries of “How–how–how–how–” while Blackhawk pounded the drum
vigorously.
“O’ course different ones has different gifts. Now who in all this
Tribe is the best runner? That’s Little Beaver.”
("How–how–how–how–how–” and drum.)
“That’s my drum, Ma!” said Guy aside, forgetting to applaud.
“Who is the best trailer and climber? Little Beaver, again, I reckon.”
("How–how–how–how–” and drum.)
("He can’t see worth a cent!” whispered Guy to his mother.)
“Who was it won the trial of grit at Garney’s grave? Why, it was
Little Beaver.”
("An’ got pretty badly scared doin’ it!” was Guy’s aside.)
“But who was it shot the Cat-Owl plumb in the heart, an’ fit the Lynx
hand to hand, not to speak of the Coon? Little Beaver every time.”
("He never killed a Woodchuck in his life, Ma!”)
“Then, again, which of us can lay all the others on his back? Little
Beaver, I s’pose.”
("Well, I can lick Char-less, any time,” was Guy’s aside.)
“Which of us has most grand coups and scalps?”
“Ye’re forgittin’ his eddication,” put in Raften to be scornfully
ignored; even Little Beaver resented this as un-Indian.
“Which has most scalps?” Sam repeated with sternness. “Here’s a scalp
won in battle with the inimy,” Woodpecker held it up, and the Medicine
Man fastened it on the edge of the shield that hung from the post.
“Here is one tuk from the Head Chief of the hostiles,” and Caleb
fastened that to the shield. “Here is another tuk from the Second
Chief of the hostiles,” and Caleb placed it. “Here is one tuk from the
Great Head War Chief of the Sangers, and here is one from the Head
Chief of the Boilers, and another tuk in battle. Six scalps from six
famous warriors. This yere is the record for the whole Tribe, an’
Little Beaver done it; besides which, he draws pictures, writes
poethry and cooks purty good, an’ I say Little Beaver is the one for
Chief! What says the rest?” and with one voice they shouted, “Hoorah
for Little Beaver!”
“How–how–how–how–how–thump, thump, thump, thump.”
“Any feller anything to say agin it?”
“I eh–” Guy began.
–"has got to lick the Chief,” Sam continued, and Guy did not complete
his objection, though he whispered to his mother, “If it was Char-less
I bet I’d show him.”
[Illustration: The shield]
Caleb now pulled the cover off the shield that he fastened the scalps
to, and it showed the white Buffalo of the Sangers with a Little
Beaver above it. Then he opened a bundle lying near and produced a
gorgeous war-shirt of buff leather, a pair of leggins and moccasins,
all fringed, beaded and painted, made by Saryann under Caleb’s
guidance. They were quickly put on the new Chief; his war bonnet,
splendid with the plumes of his recent exploits, was all ready; and
proud and happy in his new-found honours, not least of which were his
wounds, he stepped forward.
[Illustration: Little Beaver, the New War Chief]
Caleb viewed him with paternal pride and said: “I knowed ye was the
stuff the night ye went to Garney’s grave, an’ I knowed it again when
ye crossed the Big Swamp. Yan, ye could travel anywhere that man could
go,” and in that sentence the boy’s happiness was complete. He surely
was a Woodcrafter now. He stammered in a vain attempt to say something
appropriate, till Sam relieved him by: “Three cheers for the Head War
Chief!” and when the racket was over the women opened their baskets
and spread the picnic feast. Raften, who had been much gratified by
his son’s flow of speech, recorded a new vow to make him study law,
but took advantage of the first gap in the chatter to say:
“Bhise, ye’r two weeks’ holiday with wan week extension was up at noon
to-day. In wan hour an’ a half the Pigs is fed.”
