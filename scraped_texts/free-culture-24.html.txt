Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a registration with the 
Copyright Office to register or renew a copyright. When filing that 
registration, the copyright owner paid a fee. As with most government agencies, 
the Copyright Office had little incentive to minimize the burden of 
registration; it also had little incentive to minimize the fee. And as the 
Copyright Office is not a main target of government policy- making, the office 
has historically been terribly underfunded. Thus, when people who know something 
about the process hear this idea about formalities, their first reaction is 
panicnothing could be worse than forcing people to deal with the mess that is 
the Copyright Office.
Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a tradition of 
extraordinary innovation in governmental design, can no longer think 
innovatively about how governmental functions can be designed. Just because 
there is a public purpose to a government role, it doesn’t follow that the 
government must actually administer the role. Instead, we should be creating 
incentives for private parties to serve the public, subject to standards that 
the government sets.
In the context of registration, one obvious model is the Internet. There are at 
least 32 million Web sites registered around the world. Domain name owners for 
these Web sites have to pay a fee to keep their registration alive. In the main 
top-level domains (.com, .org, .net), there is a central registry. The actual 
registrations are, however, performed by many competing registrars. That 
competition drives the cost of registering down, and more importantly, it drives 
the ease with which registration occurs up.
We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal of copyrights. 
The Copyright Office may well serve as the central registry, but it should not 
be in the registrar business. Instead, it should establish a database, and a set 
of standards for registrars. It should approve registrars that meet its 
standards. Those registrars would then compete with one another to deliver the 
cheapest and simplest systems for registering and renewing copyrights. That 
competition would substantially lower the burden of this formalitywhile 
producing a database of registrations that would facilitate the licensing of 
content.
