Know you not that the thing is a warfare? one man’s duty is
to mount guard, another must go out to reconnoitre, a third to

expedient. But you, instead of executing your Commander’s orders,
complain if aught harsher than usual is enjoined; not
understanding to what condition you are bringing the army, so far
as in you lies. If all were to follow your example, none would
dig a trench, none would cast a rampart around the camp, none
would keep watch, or expose himself to danger; but all turn out
useless for the service of war. . . . Thus it is here also. Every
life is a warfare, and that long and various. You must fulfil a

in excellence.
