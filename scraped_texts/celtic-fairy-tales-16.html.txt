Once there was a poor widow, as often there has been, and she had
one son. A very scarce summer came, and they didn’t know how they’d
live till the new potatoes would be fit for eating. So Jack said to
his mother one evening, “Mother, bake my cake, and kill my hen, till
I go seek my fortune; and if I meet it, never fear but I’ll soon be
back to share it with you.”
So she did as he asked her, and he set out at break of day on his
journey. His mother came along with him to the yard gate, and says
she, “Jack, which would you rather have, half the cake and half the
hen with my blessing, or the whole of ’em with my curse?”
“O musha, mother,” says Jack, “why do you ax me that question? sure
you know I wouldn’t have your curse and Damer’s estate along with
it.”
“Well, then, Jack,” says she, “here’s the whole lot of ’em with my
thousand blessings along with them.” So she stood on the yard fence
and blessed him as far as her eyes could see him.
Well, he went along and along till he was tired, and ne’er a
farmer’s house he went into wanted a boy. At last his road led by
the side of a bog, and there was a poor ass up to his shoulders near
a big bunch of grass he was striving to come at.
“Ah, then, Jack asthore,” says he, “help me out or I’ll be drowned.”
“Never say’t twice,” says Jack, and be pitched in big stones and
sods into the slob, till the ass got good ground under him.
“Thank you, Jack,” says he, when he was out on the hard road; “I’ll
do as much for you another time. Where are you going?”
“Faith, I’m going to seek my fortune till harvest comes in, God
bless it!”
“And if you like,” says the ass, “I’ll go along with you; who knows
what luck we may have!”
“With all my heart, it’s getting late, let us be jogging.”
Well, they were going through a village, and a whole army of
gossoons were hunting a poor dog with a kettle tied to his tail. He
ran up to Jack for protection, and the ass let such a roar out of
him, that the little thieves took to their heels as if the ould boy
was after them.
“More power to you, Jack,” says the dog.
“I’m much obleeged to you: where is the baste and yourself going?”
“We’re going to seek our fortune till harvest comes in.”
“And wouldn’t I be proud to go with you!” says the dog, “and get rid
of them ill conducted boys; purshuin’ to ’em.”
“Well, well, throw your tail over your arm, and come along.”
They got outside the town, and sat down under an old wall, and Jack
pulled out his bread and meat, and shared with the dog; and the ass
made his dinner on a bunch of thistles. While they were eating and
chatting, what should come by but a poor half-starved cat, and the
moll-row he gave out of him would make your heart ache.
“You look as if you saw the tops of nine houses since breakfast,"
says Jack; “here’s a bone and something on it.”
“May your child never know a hungry belly!” says Tom; “it’s myself
that’s in need of your kindness. May I be so bold as to ask where
yez are all going?”
“We’re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in, and you
may join us if you like.”
“And that I’ll do with a heart and a half,” says the cat, “and
thank’ee for asking me."’
Off they set again, and just as the shadows of the trees were three
times as long as themselves, they heard a great cackling in a field
inside the road, and out over the ditch jumped a fox with a fine
black cock in his mouth.
“Oh, you anointed villain!” says the ass, roaring like thunder.
“At him, good dog!” says Jack, and the word wasn’t out of his mouth
when Coley was in full sweep after the Red Dog. Reynard dropped his
prize like a hot potato, and was off like shot, and the poor cock
came back fluttering and trembling to Jack and his comrades.
“O musha, naybours!” says he, “wasn’t it the height o’ luck that
threw you in my way! Maybe I won’t remember your kindness if ever I
find you in hardship; and where in the world are you all going?”
“We’re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in; you may
join our party if you like, and sit on Neddy’s crupper when your
legs and wings are tired.”
Well, the march began again, and just as the sun was gone down they
looked around, and there was neither cabin nor farm house in sight.
“Well, well,” says Jack, “the worse luck now the better another
time, and it’s only a summer night after all. We’ll go into the
wood, and make our bed on the long grass.”
No sooner said than done. Jack stretched himself on a bunch of dry
grass, the ass lay near him, the dog and cat lay in the ass’s warm
lap, and the cock went to roost in the next tree.
Well, the soundness of deep sleep was over them all, when the cock
took a notion of crowing.
“Bother you, Black Cock!” says the ass: “you disturbed me from as
nice a wisp of hay as ever I tasted. What’s the matter?”
“It’s daybreak that’s the matter: don’t you see light yonder?”
“I see a light indeed,” says Jack, “but it’s from a candle it’s
coming, and not from the sun. As you’ve roused us we may as well go
over, and ask for lodging.”
So they all shook themselves, and went on through grass, and rocks,
and briars, till they got down into a hollow, and there was the
light coming through the shadow, and along with it came singing, and
laughing, and cursing.
“Easy, boys!” says Jack: “walk on your tippy toes till we see what
sort of people we have to deal with.”
So they crept near the window, and there they saw six robbers
inside, with pistols, and blunderbushes, and cutlashes, sitting at a
table, eating roast beef and pork, and drinking mulled beer, and
wine, and whisky punch.
“Wasn’t that a fine haul we made at the Lord of Dunlavin’s!” says
one ugly-looking thief with his mouth full, “and it’s little we’d
get only for the honest porter! here’s his purty health!”
“The porter’s purty health!” cried out every one of them, and Jack
bent his finger at his comrades.
“Close your ranks, my men,” says he in a whisper, “and let every one
mind the word of command.”
So the ass put his fore-hoofs on the sill of the window, the dog got
on the ass’s head, the cat on the dog’s head, and the cock on the
cat’s head. Then Jack made a sign, and they all sung out like mad.
“Hee-haw, hee-haw!” roared the ass; “bow-wow!” barked the dog;
“meaw-meaw!” cried the cat; “cock-a-doodle-doo!” crowed the cock.
“Level your pistols!” cried Jack, “and make smithereens of ’em.
Don’t leave a mother’s son of ’em alive; present, fire!”  With that
they gave another halloo, and smashed every pane in the window. The
robbers were frightened out of their lives. They blew out the
candles, threw down the table, and skelped out at the back door as
if they were in earnest, and never drew rein till they were in the
very heart of the wood.
Jack and his party got into the room, closed the shutters, lighted
the candles, and ate and drank till hunger and thirst were gone.
Then they lay down to rest;–Jack in the bed, the ass in the stable,
the dog on the door-mat, the cat by the fire, and the cock on the
perch.
At first the robbers were very glad to find themselves safe in the
thick wood, but they soon began to get vexed.
“This damp grass is very different from our warm room,” says one.
“I was obliged to drop a fine pig’s foot,” says another.
“I didn’t get a tayspoonful of my last tumbler,” says another.
“And all the Lord of Dunlavin’s gold and silver that we left
behind!” says the last.
“I think I’ll venture back,” says the captain, “and see if we can
recover anything.”
“That’s a good boy!” said they all, and away he went.
The lights were all out, and so he groped his way to the fire, and
there the cat flew in his face, and tore him with teeth and claws.
He let a roar out of him, and made for the room door, to look for a
candle inside. He trod on the dog’s tail, and if he did, he got the
marks of his teeth in his arms, and legs, and thighs.
“Thousand murders!” cried he; “I wish I was out of this unlucky
house.”
When he got to the street door, the cock dropped down upon him with
his claws and bill, and what the cat and dog done to him was only a
flay-bite to what he got from the cock.
“Oh, tattheration to you all, you unfeeling vagabones!” says he,
when he recovered his breath; and he staggered and spun round and
round till he reeled into the stable, back foremost, but the ass
received him with a kick on the broadest part of his small clothes,
and laid him comfortably on the dunghill.
When he came to himself, he scratched his head, and began to think
what happened him; and as soon as he found that his legs were able
to carry him, he crawled away, dragging one foot after another, till
he reached the wood.
“Well, well,” cried them all, when he came within hearing, “any
chance of our property?”
“You may say chance,” says he, “and it’s itself is the poor chance
all out. Ah, will any of you pull a bed of dry grass for me? All the
sticking-plaster in Enniscorthy will be too little for the cuts and
bruises I have on me. Ah, if you only knew what I have gone through
for you! When I got to the kitchen fire, looking for a sod of
lighted turf, what should be there but an old woman carding flax,
and you may see the marks she left on my face with the cards. I made
to the room door as fast as I could, and who should I stumble over
but a cobbler and his seat, and if he did not work at me with his
awls and his pinchers you may call me a rogue. Well, I got away from
him somehow, but when I was passing through the door, it must be the
divel himself that pounced down on me with his claws, and his teeth,
that were equal to sixpenny nails, and his wings–ill luck be in his
road! Well, at last I reached the stable, and there, by way of
salute, I got a pelt from a sledge-hammer that sent me half a mile
off. If you don’t believe me, I’ll give you leave to go and judge
for yourselves.”
“Oh, my poor captain,” says they, “we believe you to the nines.
Catch us, indeed, going within a hen’s race of that unlucky cabin!”
Well, before the sun shook his doublet next morning, Jack and his
comrades were up and about. They made a hearty breakfast on what was
left the night before, and then they all agreed to set off to the
castle of the Lord of Dunlavin, and give him back all his gold and
silver. Jack put it all in the two ends of a sack and laid it across
Neddy’s back, and all took the road in their hands. Away they went,
through bogs, up hills, down dales, and sometimes along the yellow
high road, till they came to the hall-door of the Lord of Dunlavin,
and who should be there, airing his powdered head, his white
stockings, and his red breeches, but the thief of a porter.
He gave a cross look to the visitors, and says he to Jack, “What do
you want here, my fine fellow? there isn’t room for you all.”
“We want,” says Jack, “what I’m sure you haven’t to give us–and
that is, common civility.”
“Come, be off, you lazy strollers!” says he, “while a cat ’ud be
licking her ear, or I’ll let the dogs at you.”
“Would you tell a body,” says the cock that was perched on the ass’s
head, “who was it that opened the door for the robbers the other
night?”
Ah! maybe the porter’s red face didn’t turn the colour of his frill,
and the Lord of Dunlavin and his pretty daughter, that were standing
at the parlour window unknownst to the porter, put out their heads.
“I’d be glad, Barney,” says the master, “to hear your answer to the
gentleman with the red comb on him.”
“Ah, my lord, don’t believe the rascal; sure I didn’t open the door
to the six robbers.”
“And how did you know there were six, you poor innocent?” said the
lord.
“Never mind, sir,” says Jack, “all your gold and silver is there in
that sack, and I don’t think you will begrudge us our supper and bed
after our long march from the wood of Athsalach.”
“Begrudge, indeed! Not one of you will ever see a poor day if I can
help it.”
So all were welcomed to their heart’s content, and the ass and the
dog and the cock got the best posts in the farmyard, and the cat
took possession of the kitchen. The lord took Jack in hands, dressed
him from top to toe in broadcloth, and frills as white as snow, and
turnpumps, and put a watch in his fob. When they sat down to dinner,
the lady of the house said Jack had the air of a born gentleman
about him, and the lord said he’d make him his steward. Jack brought
his mother, and settled her comfortably near the castle, and all
were as happy as you please.
