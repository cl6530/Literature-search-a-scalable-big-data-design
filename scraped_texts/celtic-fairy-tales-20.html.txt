What Irish man, woman, or child has not heard of our renowned
Hibernian Hercules, the great and glorious Fin M’Coul? Not one, from
Cape Clear to the Giant’s Causeway, nor from that back again to Cape
Clear. And, by-the-way, speaking of the Giant’s Causeway brings me
at once to the beginning of my story. Well, it so happened that Fin
and his men were all working at the Causeway, in order to make a
bridge across to Scotland; when Fin, who was very fond of his wife
Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go home and see how the
poor woman got on in his absence. So, accordingly, he pulled up a
fir-tree, and, after lopping off the roots and branches, made a
walking-stick of it, and set out on his way to Oonagh.
Oonagh, or rather Fin, lived at this time on the very tip-top of
Knockmany Hill, which faces a cousin of its own called Cullamore,
that rises up, half-hill, half-mountain, on the opposite side.
There was at that time another giant, named Cucullin–some say he
was Irish, and some say he was Scotch–but whether Scotch or Irish,
sorrow doubt of it but he was a targer. No other giant of the day
could stand before him; and such was his strength, that, when well
vexed, he could give a stamp that shook the country about him. The
fame and name of him went far and near; and nothing in the shape of
a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a fight. By one blow
of his fists he flattened a thunderbolt and kept it in his pocket,
in the shape of a pancake, to show to all his enemies, when they
were about to fight him. Undoubtedly he had given every giant in
Ireland a considerable beating, barring Fin M’Coul himself; and he
swore that he would never rest, night or day, winter or summer, till
he would serve Fin with the same sauce, if he could catch him.
However, the short and long of it was, with reverence be it spoken,
that Fin heard Cucullin was coming to the Causeway to have a trial
of strength with him; and he was seized with a very warm and sudden
fit of affection for his wife, poor woman, leading a very lonely,
uncomfortable life of it in his absence. He accordingly pulled up
the fir-tree, as I said before, and having snedded it into a
walking-stick, set out on his travels to see his darling Oonagh on
the top of Knockmany, by the way.
In truth, the people wondered very much why it was that Fin selected
such a windy spot for his dwelling-house, and they even went so far
as to tell him as much.
“What can you mane, Mr. M’Coul,” said they, “by pitching your tent
upon the top of Knockmany, where you never are without a breeze, day
or night, winter or summer, and where you’re often forced to take
your nightcap without either going to bed or turning up your little
finger; ay, an’ where, besides this, there’s the sorrow’s own want
of water?”
“Why,” said Fin, “ever since I was the height of a round tower, I
was known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own; and where
the dickens, neighbours, could I find a better spot for a good
prospect than the top of Knockmany? As for water, I am sinking a
pump, and, plase goodness, as soon as the Causeway’s made, I intend
to finish it.”
Now, this was more of Fin’s philosophy; for the real state of the
case was, that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he
might be able to see Cucullin coming towards the house. All we have
to say is, that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look-
out–and, between ourselves, he did want it grievously–barring
Slieve Croob, or Slieve Donard, or its own cousin, Cullamore, he
could not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the
sweet and sagacious province of Ulster.
“God save all here!” said Fin, good-humouredly, on putting his
honest face into his own door.
“Musha, Fin, avick, an’ you’re welcome home to your own Oonagh, you
darlin’ bully.” Here followed a smack that is said to have made the
waters of the lake at the bottom of the hill curl, as it were, with
kindness and sympathy.
Fin spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very
comfortable, considering the dread he had of Cucullin. This,
however, grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive
something lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself. Let a
woman alone, in the meantime, for ferreting or wheedling a secret
out of her good man, when she wishes. Fin was a proof of this.
“It’s this Cucullin,” said he, “that’s troubling me. When the fellow
gets angry, and begins to stamp, he’ll shake you a whole townland;
and it’s well known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always
carries one about him in the shape of a pancake, to show to any one
that might misdoubt it.”
As he spoke, he clapped his thumb in his mouth, which he always did
when he wanted to prophesy, or to know anything that happened in his
absence; and the wife asked him what he did it for.
“He’s coming,” said Fin; “I see him below Dungannon.”
“Thank goodness, dear! an’ who is it, avick? Glory be to God!”
“That baste, Cucullin,” replied Fin; “and how to manage I don’t
know. If I run away, I am disgraced; and I know that sooner or later
I must meet him, for my thumb tells me so.”
“When will he be here?” said she.
“To-morrow, about two o’clock,” replied Fin, with a groan.
“Well, my bully, don’t be cast down,” said Oonagh; “depend on me,
and maybe I’ll bring you better out of this scrape than ever you
could bring yourself, by your rule o’ thumb.”
She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she
put her finger in her mouth, and gave three whistles, and by that
Cucullin knew he was invited to Cullamore–for this was the way that
the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers, to
let them know they were welcome to come and take share of whatever
was going.
In the meantime, Fin was very melancholy, and did not know what to
do, or how to act at all. Cucullin was an ugly customer to meet
with; and, the idea of the “cake” aforesaid flattened the very heart
within him. What chance could he have, strong and brave though he
was, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk the country
into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? Fin knew not
on what hand to turn him. Right or left–backward or forward–where
to go he could form no guess whatsoever.
“Oonagh,” said he, “can you do nothing for me? Where’s all your
invention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes, and
to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and
me the best man among them? How am I to fight this man-mountain–
this huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt?–with a
pancake in his pocket that was once–”
“Be easy, Fin,” replied Oonagh; “troth, I’m ashamed of you. Keep
your toe in your pump, will you? Talking of pancakes, maybe, we’ll
give him as good as any he brings with him–thunderbolt or
otherwise. If I don’t treat him to as smart feeding as he’s got this
many a day, never trust Oonagh again. Leave him to me, and do just
as I bid you.”
This relieved Fin very much; for, after all, he had great confidence
in his wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a
quandary before. Oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of
different colours, which she always did to find out the best way of
succeeding in anything of importance she went about. She then
platted them into three plats with three colours in each, putting
one on her right arm, one round her heart, and the third round her
right ankle, for then she knew that nothing could fail with her that
she undertook.
Having everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and
borrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded
into the hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she
baked on the fire in the usual way, setting them aside in the
cupboard according as they were done. She then put down a large pot
of new milk, which she made into curds and whey. Having done all
this, she sat down quite contented, waiting for his arrival on the
next day about two o’clock, that being the hour at which he was
expected–for Fin knew as much by the sucking of his thumb. Now this
was a curious property that Fin’s thumb had. In this very thing,
moreover, he was very much resembled by his great foe, Cucullin; for
it was well known that the huge strength he possessed all lay in the
middle finger of his right hand, and that, if he happened by any
mischance to lose it, he was no more, for all his bulk, than a
common man.
At length, the next day, Cucullin was seen coming across the valley,
and Oonagh knew that it was time to commence operations. She
immediately brought the cradle, and made Fin to lie down in it, and
cover himself up with the clothes.
“You must pass for your own child,” said she; “so just lie there
snug, and say nothing, but be guided by me.”
About two o’clock, as he had been expected, Cucullin came in. “God
save all here!” said he; “is this where the great Fin M’Coul lives?”
“Indeed it is, honest man,” replied Oonagh; “God save you kindly–
won’t you be sitting?”
“Thank you, ma’am,” says he, sitting down; “you’re Mrs. M’Coul, I
suppose?”
“I am,” said she; “and I have no reason, I hope, to be ashamed of my
husband.”
“No,” said the other, “he has the name of being the strongest and
bravest man in Ireland; but for all that, there’s a man not far from
you that’s very desirous of taking a shake with him. Is he at home?”
“Why, then, no,” she replied; “and if ever a man left his house in a
fury, he did. It appears that some one told him of a big basthoon of
a–giant called Cucullin being down at the Causeway to look for him,
and so he set out there to try if he could catch him. Troth, I hope,
for the poor giant’s sake, he won’t meet with him, for if he does,
Fin will make paste of him at once.”
“Well,” said the other, “I am Cucullin, and I have been seeking him
these twelve months, but he always kept clear of me; and I will
never rest night or day till I lay my hands on him.”
At this Oonagh set up a loud laugh, of great contempt, by-the-way,
and looked at him as if he was only a mere handful of a man.
“Did you ever see Fin?” said she, changing her manner all at once.
“How could I?” said he; “he always took care to keep his distance.”
“I thought so,” she replied; “I judged as much; and if you take my
advice, you poor-looking creature, you’ll pray night and day that
you may never see him, for I tell you it will be a black day for you
when you do. But, in the meantime, you perceive that the wind’s on
the door, and as Fin himself is from home, maybe you’d be civil
enough to turn the house, for it’s always what Fin does when he’s
here.”
This was a startler even to Cucullin; but he got up, however, and
after pulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked
three times, he went outside, and getting his arms about the house,
turned it as she had wished. When Fin saw this, he felt the sweat of
fear oozing out through every pore of his skin; but Oonagh,
depending upon her woman’s wit, felt not a whit daunted.
“Arrah, then,” said she, “as you are so civil, maybe you’d do
another obliging turn for us, as Fin’s not here to do it himself.
You see, after this long stretch of dry weather we’ve had, we feel
very badly off for want of water. Now, Fin says there’s a fine
spring-well somewhere under the rocks behind the hill here below,
and it was his intention to pull them asunder; but having heard of
you, he left the place in such a fury, that he never thought of it.
Now, if you try to find it, troth I’d feel it a kindness.”
She then brought Cucullin down to see the place, which was then all
one solid rock; and, after looking at it for some time, he cracked
his right middle finger nine times, and, stooping down, tore a cleft
about four hundred feet deep, and a quarter of a mile in length,
which has since been christened by the name of Lumford’s Glen.
“You’ll now come in,” said she, “and eat a bit of such humble fare
as we can give you. Fin, even although he and you are enemies, would
scorn not to treat you kindly in his own house; and, indeed, if I
didn’t do it even in his absence, he would not be pleased with me.”
She accordingly brought him in, and placing half-a-dozen of the
cakes we spoke of before him, together with a can or two of butter,
a side of boiled bacon, and a stack of cabbage, she desired him to
help himself–for this, be it known, was long before the invention
of potatoes. Cucullin put one of the cakes in his mouth to take a
huge whack out of it, when he made a thundering noise, something
between a growl and a yell. “Blood and fury!” he shouted; “how is
this? Here are two of my teeth out! What kind of bread this is you
gave me.”
“What’s the matter?” said Oonagh coolly.
“Matter!” shouted the other again; “why, here are the two best teeth
in my head gone.”
“Why,” said she, “that’s Fin’s bread–the only bread he ever eats
when at home; but, indeed, I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat
it but himself, and that child in the cradle there. I thought,
however, that, as you were reported to be rather a stout little
fellow of your size, you might be able to manage it, and I did not
wish to affront a man that thinks himself able to fight Fin. Here’s
another cake–maybe it’s not so hard as that.”
Cucullin at the moment was not only hungry, but ravenous, so he
accordingly made a fresh set at the second cake, and immediately
another yell was heard twice as loud as the first. “Thunder and
gibbets!” he roared, “take your bread out of this, or I will not
have a tooth in my head; there’s another pair of them gone!”
“Well, honest man,” replied Oonagh, “if you’re not able to eat the
bread, say so quietly, and don’t be wakening the child in the cradle
there. There, now, he’s awake upon me.”
Fin now gave a skirl that startled the giant, as coming from such a
youngster as he was supposed to be.
“Mother,” said he, “I’m hungry-get me something to eat.” Oonagh went
over, and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it,
Fin, whose appetite in the meantime had been sharpened by seeing
eating going forward, soon swallowed it. Cucullin was thunderstruck,
and secretly thanked his stars that he had the good fortune to miss
meeting Fin, for, as he said to himself, “I’d have no chance with a
man who could eat such bread as that, which even his son that’s but
in his cradle can munch before my eyes.”
“I’d like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle,” said he to
Oonagh; “for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that
nutriment is no joke to look at, or to feed of a scarce summer.”
“With all the veins of my heart,” replied Oonagh; “get up, acushla,
and show this decent little man something that won’t be unworthy of
your father, Fin M’Coul.”
Fin, who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as
possible, got up, and bringing Cucullin out, “Are you strong?” said
he.
“Thunder an’ ounds!” exclaimed the other, “what a voice in so small
a chap!”
“Are you strong?” said Fin again; “are you able to squeeze water out
of that white stone?” he asked, putting one into Cucullin’s hand.
The latter squeezed and squeezed the stone, but in vain.
“Ah, you’re a poor creature!” said Fin. “You a giant! Give me the
stone here, and when I’ll show what Fin’s little son can do, you may
then judge of what my daddy himself is.”
Fin then took the stone, and exchanging it for the curds, he
squeezed the latter until the whey, as clear as water, oozed out in
a little shower from his hand.
“I’ll now go in,” said he, “to my cradle; for I scorn to lose my
time with any one that’s not able to eat my daddy’s bread, or
squeeze water out of a stone. Bedad, you had better be off out of
this before he comes back; for if he catches you, it’s in flummery
he’d have you in two minutes.”
Cucullin, seeing what he had seen, was of the same opinion himself;
his knees knocked together with the terror of Fin’s return, and he
accordingly hastened to bid Oonagh farewell, and to assure her, that
from that day out, he never wished to hear of, much less to see, her
husband. “I admit fairly that I’m not a match for him,” said he,
“strong as I am; tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague,
and that I will make myself scarce in this part of the country while
I live.”
Fin, in the meantime, had gone into the cradle, where he lay very
quietly, his heart at his mouth with delight that Cucullin was about
to take his departure, without discovering the tricks that had been
played off on him.
“It’s well for you,” said Oonagh, “that he doesn’t happen to be
here, for it’s nothing but hawk’s meat he’d make of you.”
“I know that,” says Cucullin; “divil a thing else he’d make of me;
but before I go, will you let me feel what kind of teeth Fin’s lad
has got that can eat griddle-bread like that?”
“With all pleasure in life,” said she; “only, as they’re far back in
his head, you must put your finger a good way in.”
Cucullin was surprised to find such a powerful set of grinders in
one so young; but he was still much more so on finding, when he took
his hand from Fin’s mouth, that he had left the very finger upon
which his whole strength depended, behind him. He gave one loud
groan, and fell down at once with terror and weakness. This was all
Fin wanted, who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy
was at his mercy. He started out of the cradle, and in a few minutes
the great Cucullin, that was for such a length of time the terror of
him and all his followers, lay a corpse before him. Thus did Fin,
through the wit and invention of Oonagh, his wife, succeed in
overcoming his enemy by cunning, which he never could have done by
force.
