The next day being Sunday, after washing and clearing
decks, and getting breakfast, the mate came forward with
leave for one watch to go ashore, on liberty.  We drew lots,
and it fell to the larboard, which I was in.  Instantly all was
preparation.  Buckets of fresh water, (which we were allowed in
port,) and soap, were put in use; go-ashore jackets and trowsers
got out and brushed; pumps, neckerchiefs, and hats overhauled;
one lending to another; so that among the whole each one got a
good fit-out.  A boat was called to pull the “liberty men” ashore,
and we sat down in the stern sheets, “as big as pay passengers,"
and jumping ashore, set out on our walk for the town, which was
nearly three miles off.
It is a pity that some other arrangement is not made in merchant
vessels, with regard to the liberty-day.  When in port, the crews
are kept at work all the week, and the only day they are allowed
for rest or pleasure is the Sabbath; and unless they go ashore on
that day, they cannot go at all.  I have heard of a religious captain
who gave his crew liberty on Saturdays, after twelve o’clock.
This would be a good plan, if shipmasters would bring themselves to
give their crews so much time.  For young sailors especially, many
of whom have been brought up with a regard for the sacredness of
the day, this strong temptation to break it, is exceedingly injurious.
As it is, it can hardly be expected that a crew, on a long and
hard voyage, will refuse a few hours of freedom from toil and the
restraints of a vessel, and an opportunity to tread the ground and
see the sights of society and humanity, because it is on a Sunday.
It is too much like escaping from prison, or being drawn out of a
pit, on the Sabbath day.
I shall never forget the delightful sensation of being in the
open air, with the birds singing around me, and escaped from
the confinement, labor, and strict rule of a vessel–of being
once more in my life, though only for a day, my own master.
A sailor’s liberty is but for a day; yet while it lasts it
is perfect.  He is under no one’s eye, and can do whatever,
and go wherever, he pleases.  This day, for the first time,
I may truly say, in my whole life, I felt the meaning of a term
which I had often heard–the sweets of liberty.  My friend S––-
was with me, and turning our backs upon the vessels, we walked
slowly along, talking of the pleasure of being our own masters,
of the times past, and when we were free in the midst of friends,
in America, and of the prospect of our return; and planning where
we would go, and what we would do, when we reached home.  It was
wonderful how the prospect brightened, and how short and tolerable
the voyage appeared, when viewed in this new light.  Things looked
differently from what they did when we talked them over in the little
dark forecastle, the night after the flogging at San Pedro.  It is
not the least of the advantages of allowing sailors occasionally
a day of liberty, that it gives them a spring, and makes them feel
cheerful and independent, and leads them insensibly to look on the
bright side of everything for some time after.
S––- and myself determined to keep as much together as possible,
though we knew that it would not do to cut our shipmates; for,
knowing our birth and education, they were a little suspicious
that we would try to put on the gentleman when we got ashore,
and would be ashamed of their company; and this won’t do with
Jack.  When the voyage is at an end, you may do as you please,
but so long as you belong to the same vessel, you must be a
shipmate to him on shore, or he will not be a shipmate to you on
board.  Being forewarned of this before I went to sea, I took no
“long togs” with me, and being dressed like the rest, in white duck
trowsers, blue jacket and straw hat, which would prevent my going
in better company, and showing no disposition to avoid them, I set
all suspicion at rest.  Our crew fell in with some who belonged
to the other vessels, and, sailor-like, steered for the first
grog-shop.  This was a small mud building, of only one room, in
which were liquors, dry and West India goods, shoes, bread, fruits,
and everything which is vendible in California.  It was kept by
a yankee, a one-eyed man, who belonged formerly to Fall River,
came out to the Pacific in a whale-ship, left her at the Sandwich
Islands, and came to California and set up a “Pulperia.”  S––- and
I followed in our shipmates’ wake, knowing that to refuse to drink
with them would be the highest affront, but determining to slip
away at the first opportunity.  It is the universal custom with sailors
for each one, in his turn, to treat the whole, calling for a glass all
round, and obliging every one who is present, even the keeper of
the shop, to take a glass with him.  When we first came in, there
was some dispute between our crew and the others, whether the
new comers or the old California rangers should treat first; but it
being settled in favor of the latter, each of the crews of the other
vessels treated all round in their turn, and as there were a good
many present, (including some “loafers” who had dropped in, knowing
what was going on, to take advantage of Jack’s hospitality,)
and the liquor was a real (12½ cents) a glass, it made somewhat
of a hole in their lockers.  It was now our ship’s turn, and S––-
and I, anxious to get away, stepped up to call for glasses; but we
soon found that we must go in order–the oldest first, for the old
sailors did not choose to be preceded by a couple of youngsters;
and bon gré mal gré, we had to wait our turn, with the twofold
apprehension of being too late for our horses, and of getting
corned; for drink you must, every time; and if you drink with
one and not with another, it is always taken as an insult.
Having at length gone through our turns and acquitted ourselves
of all obligations, we slipped out, and went about among the
houses, endeavoring to get horses for the day, so that we might
ride round and see the country.  At first we had but little success,
all that we could get out of the lazy fellows, in reply to our
questions, being the eternal drawling “Quien sabe?” ("who knows?”)
which is an answer to all questions.  After several efforts,
we at length fell in with a little Sandwich Island boy, who belonged
to Captain Wilson of the Ayacucho, and was well acquainted in
the place; and he, knowing where to go, soon procured us two
horses, ready saddled and bridled, each with a lasso coiled over
the pommel.  These we were to have all day, with the privilege of
riding them down to the beach at night, for a dollar, which we had
to pay in advance.  Horses are the cheapest thing in California;
the very best not being worth more than ten dollars apiece, and very
good ones being often sold for three, and four.  In taking a day’s
ride, you pay for the use of the saddle, and for the labor and
trouble of catching the horses.  If you bring the saddle back safe,
they care but little what becomes of the horse.  Mounted on our
horses, which were spirited beasts, and which, by the way, in this
country, are always steered by pressing the contrary rein against
the neck, and not by pulling on the bit,–we started off on a fine
run over the country.  The first place we went to was the old
ruinous presidio, which stands on a rising ground near the village,
which it overlooks.  It is built in the form of an open square,
like all the other presidios, and was in a most ruinous state,
with the exception of one side, in which the commandant lived,
with his family.  There were only two guns, one of which was spiked,
and the other had no carriage.  Twelve, half clothed, and half starved
looking fellows, composed the garrison; and they, it was said, had
not a musket apiece.  The small settlement lay directly below the
fort, composed of about forty dark brown looking huts, or houses,
and two larger ones, plastered, which belonged to two of the “gente
de razón.”  This town is not more than half as large as Monterey,
or Santa Barbara, and has little or no business.  From the presidio,
we rode off in the direction of the mission, which we were told was
three miles distant.  The country was rather sandy, and there was
nothing for miles which could be called a tree, but the grass grew
green and rank, and there were many bushes and thickets, and the
soil is said to be good.  After a pleasant ride of a couple of miles,
we saw the white walls of the mission, and fording a small river,
we came directly before it.  The mission is built of mud, or rather
of the unburnt bricks of the country, and plastered.  There was
something decidedly striking in its appearance: a number of irregular
buildings, connected with one another, and disposed in the form of
a hollow square, with a church at one end, rising above the rest,
with a tower containing five belfries, in each of which hung a large
bell, and with immense rusty iron crosses at the tops.  Just outside
of the buildings, and under the walls, stood twenty or thirty small
huts, built of straw and of the branches of trees, grouped together,
in which a few Indians lived, under the protection and in the service
of the mission.
Entering a gate-way, we drove into the open square, in which the
stillness of death reigned.  On one side was the church; on another,
a range of high buildings with grated windows; a third was a range
of smaller buildings, or offices; and the fourth seemed to be little
more than a high connecting wall.  Not a living creature could we
see.  We rode twice round the square, in the hope of waking up
some one; and in one circuit, saw a tall monk, with shaven head,
sandals, and the dress of the Grey Friars, pass rapidly through a
gallery, but he disappeared without noticing us.  After two circuits,
we stopped our horses, and saw, at last, a man show himself in
front of one of the small buildings.  We rode up to him, and found
him dressed in the common dress of the country, with a silver
chain round his neck, supporting a large bunch of keys.  From this,
we took him to be the steward of the mission, and addressing him
as “Mayordomo,” received a low bow and an invitation to walk
into his room.  Making our horses fast, we went in.  It was a plain
room, containing a table, three or four chairs, a small picture or
two of some saint, or miracle, or martyrdom, and a few dishes and
glasses.  “Hay algunas cosa de comer?” said I.  “Si Señor!” said he.
“Que gusta usted?”  Mentioning frijoles, which I knew they must
have if they had nothing else, and beef and bread, and a hint for
wine, if they had any, he went off to another building, across the
court, and returned in a few moments, with a couple of Indian boys,
bearing dishes and a decanter of wine.  The dishes contained baked
meats, frijoles stewed with peppers and onions, boiled eggs, and
California flour baked into a kind of macaroni.  These, together
with the wine, made the most sumptuous meal we had eaten since we
left Boston; and, compared with the fare we had lived upon for
seven months, it was a regal banquet.  After despatching our meal,
we took out some money and asked him how much we were to pay.
He shook his head, and crossed himself, saying that it was charity:
–that the Lord gave it to us.  Knowing the amount of this to be
that he did not sell it, but was willing to receive a present,
we gave him ten or twelve reals, which he pocketed with admirable
nonchalance, saying, “Dios se lo pague.”  Taking leave of him,
we rode out to the Indians’ huts.  The little children were
running about among the huts, stark naked, and the men were not
much better; but the women had generally coarse gowns, of a sort of
tow cloth.  The men are employed, most of the time, in tending the
cattle of the mission, and in working in the garden, which is a very
large one, including several acres, and filled, it is said, with the
best fruits of the climate.  The language of these people, which is
spoken by all the Indians of California, is the most brutish and
inhuman language, without any exception, that I ever heard, or that
could well be conceived of.  It is a complete slabber.  The words
fall off of the ends of their tongues, and a continual slabbering sound
is made in the cheeks, outside of the teeth.  It cannot have been
the language of Montezuma and the independent Mexicans.
Here, among the huts, we saw the oldest man that I had ever seen;
and, indeed, I never supposed that a person could retain life and
exhibit such marks of age.  He was sitting out in the sun, leaning
against the side of a hut; and his legs and arms, which were bare,
were of a dark red color, the skin withered and shrunk up like
burnt leather, and the limbs not larger round than those of a boy
of five years.  He had a few grey hairs, which were tied together
at the back of his head; and he was so feeble that, when we came
up to him, he raised his hands slowly to his face, and taking hold
of his lids with his fingers, lifted them up to look at us;
and being satisfied, let them drop again.  All command over the
lid seemed to have gone.  I asked his age, but could get no answer
but “Quien sabe?” and they probably did not know the age.
Leaving the mission, we returned to village, going nearly all the
way on a full run.  The California horses have no medium gait,
which is pleasant, between walking and running; for as there are
no streets and parades, they have no need of the genteel trot,
and their riders usually keep them at the top of their speed until
they are fired, and then let them rest themselves by walking.
The fine air of the afternoon; the rapid rate of the animals,
who seemed almost to fly over the ground; and the excitement and
novelty of the motion to us, who had been so long confined on
shipboard, were exhilarating beyond expression, and we felt willing
to ride all day long.  Coming into the village, we found things
looking very lively.  The Indians, who always have a holyday on
Sunday, were engaged at playing a kind of running game of ball,
on a level piece of ground, near the houses.  The old ones sat
down in a ring, looking on, while the young ones–men, boys and
girls–were chasing the ball, and throwing it with all their
might.  Some of the girls ran like greyhounds.  At every accident,
or remarkable feat, the old people set up a deafening screaming
and clapping of hands.  Several blue jackets were reeling about
among the houses, which showed that the pulperias had been well
patronized.  One or two of the sailors had got on horseback,
but being rather indifferent horsemen, and the Spaniards having
given them vicious horses, they were soon thrown, much to the
amusement of the people.  A half dozen Sandwich Islanders,
from the hide-houses and the two brigs, who are bold riders,
were dashing about on the full gallop, hallooing and laughing
like so many wild men.
It was now nearly sundown, and S––- and myself went into a
house and sat quietly down to rest ourselves before going down to
the beach.  Several people were soon collected to see “los Ingles
marineros,” and one of them–a young woman–took a great fancy to
my pocket handkerchief, which was a large silk one that I had
before going to sea, and a handsomer one than they had been in
the habit of seeing.  Of course, I gave it to her; which brought
us into high favor; and we had a present of some pears and other
fruits, which we took down to the beach with us.  When we came
to leave the house, we found that our horses, which we left tied
at the door, were both gone.  We had paid for them to ride down
to the beach, but they were not to be found.  We went to the man
of whom we hired them, but he only shrugged his shoulders, and
to our question, “Where are the horses?” only answered–"Quien
sabe?” but as he was very easy, and made no inquiries for the
saddles, we saw that he knew very well where they were.  After a
little trouble, determined not to walk down,–a distance of three
miles–we procured two, at four reals apiece, with an Indian boy
to run on behind and bring them back.  Determined to have “the go"
out of the horses, for our trouble, we went down at full speed,
and were on the beach in fifteen minutes.  Wishing to make our
liberty last as long as possible, we rode up and down among the
hide-houses, amusing ourselves with seeing the men, as they came
down, (it was now dusk,) some on horseback and others on foot.
The Sandwich Islanders rode down, and were in “high snuff."
We inquired for our shipmates, and were told that two of them
had started on horseback and had been thrown or had fallen off,
and were seen heading for the beach, but steering pretty wild,
and by the looks of things, would not be down much before midnight.
The Indian boys having arrived, we gave them our horses, and
having seen them safely off, hailed for a boat and went aboard.
Thus ended our first liberty-day on shore.  We were well tired,
but had had a good time, and were more willing to go back to our
old duties.  About midnight, we were waked up by our two watchmates,
who had come aboard in high dispute.  It seems they had started to
come down on the same horse, double-backed; and each was accusing
the other of being the cause of his fall.  They soon, however,
turned-in and fell asleep, and probably forgot all about it,
for the next morning the dispute was not renewed.
