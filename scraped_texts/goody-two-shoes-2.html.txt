 How and about Little Margery and her Brother.
Care and Discontent shortened the Days of Little Margery’sFather.–He was forced from his Family, and seized with a violent
Fever in a Place where Dr. James’s Powder was not to be had,
and where he died miserably. Margery’s poor Mother survived the
Loss of her Husband but a few Days, and died of a broken Heart,
leaving Margery and her little Brother to the wide World; but,
poor Woman, it would have melted your Heart to have seen how
frequently she heaved up her Head, while she lay speechless, to survey
with languishing Looks her little Orphans, as much as to say, Do
Tommy, do Margery, come with me. They cried, poor Things, and she
sighed away her Soul; and I hope is happy.
It would both have excited your Pity, and have done your Heart good,
to have seen how fond these two little ones were of each other, and
how, Hand in Hand, they trotted about. Pray see them.
They were both very ragged, and Tommy had two Shoes, but
Margery had but one. They had nothing, poor Things, to support
them (not being in their own Parish) but what they picked from the
Hedges, or got from the poor People, and they lay every Night in a
Barn. Their Relations took no Notice of them; no, they were rich, and
ashamed to own such a poor little ragged Girl as Margery, and
such a dirty little curl-pated Boy as Tommy. Our Relations and
Friends seldom take Notice of us when we are poor; but as we grow rich
they grow fond. And this will always be the Case, while People love
Money better than Virtue, or better than they do GOD Almighty. But
such wicked Folks, who love nothing but Money, and are proud and
despise the Poor, never come to any good in the End, as we shall see
by and by.
