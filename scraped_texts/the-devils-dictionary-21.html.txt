T, the twentieth letter of the English alphabet, was by the Greeks 
absurdly called tau.  In the alphabet whence ours comes it had the 
form of the rude corkscrew of the period, and when it stood alone 
(which was more than the Phoenicians could always do) signified 
Tallegal, translated by the learned Dr. Brownrigg, “tanglefoot.”
TABLE D’HOTE, n.  A caterer’s thrifty concession to the universal 
passion for irresponsibility.
  Old Paunchinello, freshly wed,
      Took Madam P. to table,
  And there deliriously fed
      As fast as he was able.
  “I dote upon good grub,” he cried,
      Intent upon its throatage.
  “Ah, yes,” said the neglected bride,
      “You’re in your table d’hotage.”

TAIL, n.  The part of an animal’s spine that has transcended its 
natural limitations to set up an independent existence in a world of 
its own.  Excepting in its foetal state, Man is without a tail, a 
privation of which he attests an hereditary and uneasy consciousness 
by the coat-skirt of the male and the train of the female, and by a 
marked tendency to ornament that part of his attire where the tail 
should be, and indubitably once was.  This tendency is most observable 
in the female of the species, in whom the ancestral sense is strong 
and persistent.  The tailed men described by Lord Monboddo are now 
generally regarded as a product of an imagination unusually 
susceptible to influences generated in the golden age of our pithecan 
past.
TAKE, v.t.  To acquire, frequently by force but preferably by stealth.
TALK, v.t.  To commit an indiscretion without temptation, from an 
impulse without purpose.
TARIFF, n.  A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the 
domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.
  The Enemy of Human Souls
  Sat grieving at the cost of coals;
  For Hell had been annexed of late,
  And was a sovereign Southern State.
  “It were no more than right,” said he,
  “That I should get my fuel free.
  The duty, neither just nor wise,
  Compels me to economize —
  Whereby my broilers, every one,
  Are execrably underdone.
  What would they have? — although I yearn
  To do them nicely to a turn,
  I can’t afford an honest heat.
  This tariff makes even devils cheat!
  I’m ruined, and my humble trade
  All rascals may at will invade:
  Beneath my nose the public press
  Outdoes me in sulphureousness;
  The bar ingeniously applies
  To my undoing my own lies;
  My medicines the doctors use
  (Albeit vainly) to refuse
  To me my fair and rightful prey
  And keep their own in shape to pay;
  The preachers by example teach
  What, scorning to perform, I teach;
  And statesmen, aping me, all make
  More promises than they can break.
  Against such competition I
  Lift up a disregarded cry.
  Since all ignore my just complaint,
  By Hokey-Pokey!  I’ll turn saint!"
  Now, the Republicans, who all
  Are saints, began at once to bawl
  Against his competition; so
  There was a devil of a go!
  They locked horns with him, tete-a-tete
  In acrimonious debate,
  Till Democrats, forlorn and lone,
  Had hopes of coming by their own.
  That evil to avert, in haste
  The two belligerents embraced;
  But since ’twere wicked to relax
  A tittle of the Sacred Tax,
  ’Twas finally agreed to grant
  The bold Insurgent-protestant
  A bounty on each soul that fell
  Into his ineffectual Hell.

TECHNICALITY, n.  In an English court a man named Home was tried for 
slander in having accused his neighbor of murder.  His exact words 
were:  “Sir Thomas Holt hath taken a cleaver and stricken his cook 
upon the head, so that one side of the head fell upon one shoulder and 
the other side upon the other shoulder.”  The defendant was acquitted 
by instruction of the court, the learned judges holding that the words 
did not charge murder, for they did not affirm the death of the cook, 
that being only an inference.
TEDIUM, n.  Ennui, the state or condition of one that is bored.  Many 
fanciful derivations of the word have been affirmed, but so high an 
authority as Father Jape says that it comes from a very obvious 
source — the first words of the ancient Latin hymn Te Deum 
Laudamus.  In this apparently natural derivation there is something 
that saddens.
TEETOTALER, n.  One who abstains from strong drink, sometimes totally, 
sometimes tolerably totally.
TELEPHONE, n.  An invention of the devil which abrogates some of the 
advantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.
TELESCOPE, n.  A device having a relation to the eye similar to that 
of the telephone to the ear, enabling distant objects to plague us 
with a multitude of needless details.  Luckily it is unprovided with a 
bell summoning us to the sacrifice.
TENACITY, n.  A certain quality of the human hand in its relation to 
the coin of the realm.  It attains its highest development in the hand 
of authority and is considered a serviceable equipment for a career in 
politics.  The following illustrative lines were written of a 
Californian gentleman in high political preferment, who has passed to 
his accounting:
  Of such tenacity his grip
  That nothing from his hand can slip.
  Well-buttered eels you may o’erwhelm
  In tubs of liquid slippery-elm
  In vain — from his detaining pinch
  They cannot struggle half an inch!
  ’Tis lucky that he so is planned
  That breath he draws not with his hand,
  For if he did, so great his greed
  He’d draw his last with eager speed.
  Nay, that were well, you say.  Not so
  He’d draw but never let it go!
THEOSOPHY, n.  An ancient faith having all the certitude of religion 
and all the mystery of science.  The modern Theosophist holds, with 
the Buddhists, that we live an incalculable number of times on this 
earth, in as many several bodies, because one life is not long enough 
for our complete spiritual development; that is, a single lifetime 
does not suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to 
wish to become.  To be absolutely wise and good — that is perfection; 
and the Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that 
everything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection.  
Less competent observers are disposed to except cats, which seem 
neither wiser nor better than they were last year.  The greatest and 
fattest of recent Theosophists was the late Madame Blavatsky, who had 
no cat.
TIGHTS, n.  An habiliment of the stage designed to reinforce the 
general acclamation of the press agent with a particular publicity.  
Public attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to Miss 
Lillian Russell’s refusal to wear it, and many were the conjectures as 
to her motive, the guess of Miss Pauline Hall showing a high order of 
ingenuity and sustained reflection.  It was Miss Hall’s belief that 
nature had not endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs.  This theory 
was impossible of acceptance by the male understanding, but the 
conception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as 
to rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation!  
It is strange that in all the controversy regarding Miss Russell’s 
aversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what 
was known among the ancients as “modesty.”  The nature of that 
sentiment is now imperfectly understood, and possibly incapable of 
exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us.  The study of lost 
arts has, however, been recently revived and some of the arts 
themselves recovered.  This is an epoch of renaissances, and there 
is ground for hope that the primitive “blush” may be dragged from its 
hiding-place amongst the tombs of antiquity and hissed on to the 
stage.
TOMB, n.  The House of Indifference.  Tombs are now by common consent 
invested with a certain sanctity, but when they have been long 
tenanted it is considered no sin to break them open and rifle them, 
the famous Egyptologist, Dr. Huggyns, explaining that a tomb may be 
innocently “glened” as soon as its occupant is done “smellynge,” the 
soul being then all exhaled.  This reasonable view is now generally 
accepted by archaeologists, whereby the noble science of Curiosity has 
been greatly dignified.
TOPE, v.  To tipple, booze, swill, soak, guzzle, lush, bib, or swig.  
In the individual, toping is regarded with disesteem, but toping 
nations are in the forefront of civilization and power.  When pitted 
against the hard-drinking Christians the absemious Mahometans go down 
like grass before the scythe.  In India one hundred thousand beef- 
eating and brandy-and-soda guzzling Britons hold in subjection two 
hundred and fifty million vegetarian abstainers of the same Aryan 
race.  With what an easy grace the whisky-loving American pushed the 
temperate Spaniard out of his possessions!  From the time when the 
Berserkers ravaged all the coasts of western Europe and lay drunk in 
every conquered port it has been the same way:  everywhere the nations 
that drink too much are observed to fight rather well and not too 
righteously.  Wherefore the estimable old ladies who abolished the 
canteen from the American army may justly boast of having materially 
augmented the nation’s military power.
TORTOISE, n.  A creature thoughtfully created to supply occasion for 
the following lines by the illustrious Ambat Delaso:

TO MY PET TORTOISE

  My friend, you are not graceful — not at all;
  Your gait’s between a stagger and a sprawl.
  Nor are you beautiful:  your head’s a snake’s
  To look at, and I do not doubt it aches.
  As to your feet, they’d make an angel weep.
  ’Tis true you take them in whene’er you sleep.
  No, you’re not pretty, but you have, I own,
  A certain firmness — mostly you’re [sic] backbone.
  Firmness and strength (you have a giant’s thews)
  Are virtues that the great know how to use —
  I wish that they did not; yet, on the whole,
  You lack — excuse my mentioning it — Soul.
  So, to be candid, unreserved and true,
  I’d rather you were I than I were you.
  Perhaps, however, in a time to be,
  When Man’s extinct, a better world may see
  Your progeny in power and control,
  Due to the genesis and growth of Soul.
  So I salute you as a reptile grand
  Predestined to regenerate the land.
  Father of Possibilities, O deign
  To accept the homage of a dying reign!
  In the far region of the unforeknown
  I dream a tortoise upon every throne.
  I see an Emperor his head withdraw
  Into his carapace for fear of Law;
  A King who carries something else than fat,
  Howe’er acceptably he carries that;
  A President not strenuously bent
  On punishment of audible dissent —
  Who never shot (it were a vain attack)
  An armed or unarmed tortoise in the back;
  Subject and citizens that feel no need
  To make the March of Mind a wild stampede;
  All progress slow, contemplative, sedate,
  And “Take your time” the word, in Church and State.
  O Tortoise, ’tis a happy, happy dream,
  My glorious testudinous regime!
  I wish in Eden you’d brought this about
  By slouching in and chasing Adam out.
TREE, n.  A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal 
apparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear 
only a negligible fruit, or none at all.  When naturally fruited, the 
tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor 
in public morals.  In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit 
(white and black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the 
public taste and, though not exported, profitable to the general 
welfare.  That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no 
discovery of Judge Lynch (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the 
lamp-post and the bridge-girder) is made plain by the following 
passage from Morryster, who antedated him by two centuries:
      While in yt londe I was carried to see ye Ghogo tree, whereof 
  I had hearde moch talk; but sayynge yt I saw naught remarkabyll in 
  it, ye hed manne of ye villayge where it grewe made answer as 
  followeth:
      “Ye tree is not nowe in fruite, but in his seasonne you shall 
  see dependynge fr. his braunches all soch as have affroynted ye 
  King his Majesty."
      And I was furder tolde yt ye worde “Ghogo” sygnifyeth in yr 
  tong ye same as “rapscal” in our owne.

TRIAL, n.  A formal inquiry designed to prove and put upon record the 
blameless characters of judges, advocates and jurors.  In order to 
effect this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person 
of one who is called the defendant, the prisoner, or the accused.  If 
the contrast is made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo 
such an affliction as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable 
sense of their immunity, added to that of their worth.  In our day the 
accused is usually a human being, or a socialist, but in mediaeval 
times, animals, fishes, reptiles and insects were brought to trial.  A 
beast that had taken human life, or practiced sorcery, was duly 
arrested, tried and, if condemned, put to death by the public 
executioner.  Insects ravaging grain fields, orchards or vineyards 
were cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal, and after 
testimony, argument and condemnation, if they continued in 
contumaciam the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court, 
where they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized.  In a 
street of Toledo, some pigs that had wickedly run between the 
viceroy’s legs, upsetting him, were arrested on a warrant, tried and 
punished.  In Naples and ass was condemned to be burned at the stake, 
but the sentence appears not to have been executed.  D’Addosio relates 
from the court records many trials of pigs, bulls, horses, cocks, 
dogs, goats, etc., greatly, it is believed, to the betterment of their 
conduct and morals.  In 1451 a suit was brought against the leeches 
infesting some ponds about Berne, and the Bishop of Lausanne, 
instructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University, directed that some 
of “the aquatic worms” be brought before the local magistracy.  This 
was done and the leeches, both present and absent, were ordered to 
leave the places that they had infested within three days on pain of 
incurring “the malediction of God.”  In the voluminous records of this 
cause celebre nothing is found to show whether the offenders braved 
the punishment, or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable 
jurisdiction.
TRICHINOSIS, n.  The pig’s reply to proponents of porcophagy.
  Moses Mendlessohn having fallen ill sent for a Christian 
physician, who at once diagnosed the philosopher’s disorder as 
trichinosis, but tactfully gave it another name.  “You need and 
immediate change of diet,” he said; “you must eat six ounces of pork 
every other day."
  “Pork?” shrieked the patient — “pork?  Nothing shall induce me to 
touch it!"
  “Do you mean that?” the doctor gravely asked.
  “I swear it!"
  “Good! — then I will undertake to cure you.”
TRINITY, n.  In the multiplex theism of certain Christian churches, 
three entirely distinct deities consistent with only one.  Subordinate 
deities of the polytheistic faith, such as devils and angels, are not 
dowered with the power of combination, and must urge individually 
their clames to adoration and propitiation.  The Trinity is one of the 
most sublime mysteries of our holy religion.  In rejecting it because 
it is incomprehensible, Unitarians betray their inadequate sense of 
theological fundamentals.  In religion we believe only what we do not 
understand, except in the instance of an intelligible doctrine that 
contradicts an incomprehensible one.  In that case we believe the 
former as a part of the latter.
TROGLODYTE, n.  Specifically, a cave-dweller of the paleolithic 
period, after the Tree and before the Flat.  A famous community of 
troglodytes dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam.  The colony 
consisted of “every one that was in distress, and every one that was 
in debt, and every one that was discontented” — in brief, all the 
Socialists of Judah.
TRUCE, n.  Friendship.
TRUTH, n.  An ingenious compound of desirability and appearance.  
Discovery of truth is the sole purpose of philosophy, which is the 
most ancient occupation of the human mind and has a fair prospect of 
existing with increasing activity to the end of time.
TRUTHFUL, adj.  Dumb and illiterate.
TRUST, n.  In American politics, a large corporation composed in 
greater part of thrifty working men, widows of small means, orphans in 
the care of guardians and the courts, with many similar malefactors 
and public enemies.
TURKEY, n.  A large bird whose flesh when eaten on certain religious 
anniversaries has the peculiar property of attesting piety and 
gratitude.  Incidentally, it is pretty good eating.
TWICE, adv.  Once too often.
TYPE, n.  Pestilent bits of metal suspected of destroying 
civilization and enlightenment, despite their obvious agency in this 
incomparable dictionary.
TZETZE (or TSETSE) FLY, n.  An African insect (Glossina morsitans) 
whose bite is commonly regarded as nature’s most efficacious remedy 
for insomnia, though some patients prefer that of the American 
novelist (Mendax interminabilis).
