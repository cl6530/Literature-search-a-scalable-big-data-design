Francis Bacon (1561-1626)




IT IS a trivial grammar-school text, but yet
worthy a wise man’s consideration.  Question
was asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief
part of an orator? he answered, action; what next?
action; what next again? action.  He said it, that
knew it best, and had, by nature, himself no advantage in that he commended.  A strange thing,
that that part of an orator, which is but superficial,
and rather the virtue of a player, should be placed
so high, above those other noble parts, of invention,
elocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it
were all in all.  But the reason is plain.  There is in
human nature generally, more of the fool than of
the wise; and therefore those faculties, by which
the foolish part of men’s minds is taken, are most
potent.  Wonderful like is the case of boldness in
civil business: what first? boldness; what second
and third? boldness.  And yet boldness is a child of
ignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts.
But nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand
and foot, those that are either shallow in judgment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest
part; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak
times.  Therefore we see it hath done wonders, in
popular states; but with senates, and princes less;
and more ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action, than soon after; for boldness is an
ill keeper of promise.  Surely, as there are mountebanks for the natural body, so are there mountebanks for the politic body; men that undertake
great cures, and perhaps have been lucky, in two
or three experiments, but want the grounds of
science, and therefore cannot hold out.  Nay, you
shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet’s
miracle.  Mahomet made the people believe that
he would call an hill to him, and from the top of it
offer up his prayers, for the observers of his law.
The people assembled; Mahomet called the hill to
come to him, again and again; and when the hill
stood still, he was never a whit abashed, but said,
If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet
will go to the hill.  So these men, when they have
promised great matters, and failed most shamefully, yet (if they have the perfection of boldness)
they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and
no more ado.  Certainly to men of great judgment,
bold persons are a sport to behold; nay, and to the
vulgar also, boldness has somewhat of the ridiculous.  For if absurdity be the subject of laughter,
doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without
some absurdity.  Especially it is a sport to see, when
a bold fellow is out of countenance; for that puts
his face into a most shrunken, and wooden posture; as needs it must; for in bashfulness, the spirits
do a little go and come; but with bold men, upon
like occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at
chess, where it is no mate, but yet the game cannot
stir.  But this last were fitter for a satire than for a
serious observation.  This is well to be weighed;
that boldness is ever blind; for it seeth not danger,
and inconveniences.  Therefore it is ill in counsel,
good in execution; so that the right use of bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but be
seconds, and under the direction of others.  For in
counsel, it is good to see dangers; and in execution,
not to see them, except they be very great.
